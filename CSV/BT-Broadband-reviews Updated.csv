Ludmila,Essex,12/31/21,"BT is a disappointment!


I have made a new order with BT on Black Friday.
The gentleman who spoke to me was extremely polite and helpful and gave a good deal. Nonetheless, I have waited 30 days to have my money back service up and running, and the day before my service is supposed to go live, I Called BT.
I called BT and explained that an engineer has been booked (since the end of November) to complete some work and install the required equipment, for my service to go live tomorrow.
During the call, I was presented with new information that the engineers have been trying to contact the building management society, since the 1st of December, and have not obtained a response.
I explained to the advisor on the phone that I should have been notified of what is going on, so I could have made the required arrangements to sort out this issue.
I also stated that it has been 30 days and that in the last 2 weeks, BT employees have been conduction research/work in my residential area. I mentioned that I was failing to understand why they did not notice that something was NOT right. My point is, I am not the only BT customer in Essex; if they are sending letters and not receiving a response from the building society, is there no other way to contact them?
Could they not have sent an email or called them?
I asked the advisor and he stated that he received a 'note' from the engineer at ""1 minute ago"" stating that "" they tried to contact the building management 3x and if they do not receive a response the order will be cancelled"".
I now ask if they can write a letter and send it so swiftly, could they have NOT avoided this issue?!
I am extremely disappointed and shocked that BT has this level of lack of professionalism and sense of responsibility. The advisor enquired if I, the customer, could chase up the building management and seek authorization so they can conduct their work. It is not my responsibility to do their work, and it is quite outrageous that he proposed that to me.
I clearly said that I would not do it as it is their responsibility and duty to get the required authorizations and provide me with solutions and not problems.
I was told that if the issue is not resolved by 10/01/2022, my order will be cancelled and a new order out through.
I now have to wait 10 days for this issue to be resolved when if BT and its engineers had been professional and provided good customer service, we could have come up with better solutions for both parties.
I regret to say that BT has proven to be as bad and as appalling as other internet providers and that customers should be aware of lack of professionalism and customer service skills."
Matthew,Shrewsbury,12/30/21,"Was receiving poor download speed and BT decided to send out an engineer. I asked whether I should call and cancel the appointment if the problem resolved itself and was told no. Engineer arrived and the problem had resolved itself. BT engineer made a passing comment about a 3rd 
party extender we use for a games console but as the only device connected to this is a games console and not the two laptops (laptop always uses an Ethernet cable into the modem) it wasn’t an issue. Next month we receive an £85 bill stating that the engineer (not employed by BT but
 a company named qube) said that the extender was causing the problem. Spoke with BT who will not do anything stating that they can only go of the notes from a 3rd party engineer. Effectively being charged £85 for having a 3rd party booster in the house. Now told the only way to get a
 refund is to speak with this 3rd party company and have them change the notes? Although we have been given no contact details for them."
Don Marshall,Warrigton Cheshire,12/30/21,Always very helpful today they sorted out a problem regarding a scam call and refunded cost. Well done BT
Kevin,Tamworth,12/28/21,"Talk complete rubbish, tell you everything you want to hear and deliver nothink. Dont waist your time to customer service, you will be on hold for ever to then be cut off. Will be switching definitely."
Vytautas Raginskas,Sleaford,12/24/21,"Ordered broadband for 13th of December.Doesnt work even now on 24th of december. Engineers missed 3 appointsments only 1 out of 4 appointsments where succesfull i lost so much money waiting for them to never even get message saying they wont show up. After I called i kept
 getting different excuse. Now I got yet another my 5th appointment for 30th and who the hell knows if they will show up bt staff sure as hell doesnt.Ridiculous avoid at all costs"
Shaun Warwick,RM16,12/23/21,"Probably the worst service provider to our home.
Lost count how many times broadband has crashed, requiring a phone call to get restarted.
Have no option than to find a new broadband provider."
ralph cater,york,12/22/21,the worst service I have ever experienced After switching from sky we are back with sky with in one month Absolute garbidge BAD BAD BAD BAD no stars is the rating they deserve
Sophie,Reading,12/22/21,"Pros are being a big company, you can always speak to customser service, they will try to help and will send engineer. Broadband quality is generally OK and reliable. Cons are they are expensive and Also they are hopeless at house moves. something always goes wrong."
Nathan,Dudley,12/16/21,Really bad company Internet is very slow at some points I was only getting 3mg ring up tell you what you what you want to hear and then do nothing to sort it this went on for 3 years now with sky loads better 60gb minimum now bt are trying to say I ow them money I don't think so considering they never met there end of the deal
Regina,,12/15/21,"AVOID!!!
If i could rate it O i would.
Had our activation day on the 6th of December and I am still here with no internet.Booked in an engineer visit for the 9th.Nobody showed up. Called in to book anotherone, and they forgot to actually book in theappointment.We were supposed to have another engineervisit today on the 15th and the engineer did not show up again. When i called in they could not explain the situation.Worst customer service i have ever seen in my life. Agents replying in a rude manner raising their voices at us. No compensation for missed time of work or extra mobile data cost. We've been here with no internet for almost 2 weeks. To anybody who is thinking of switching to bt.
AVOID AVOID AVOID"
leigh,Chepstow,12/9/21,"They try hard when you manage to work out how to speak to a real person, but in our area, given that BT has owned the entire network for ever and paid out billons to shareholders, coverage and speed is shockingly third world. Also, if they want to get rid of all their employees as all 
companies obviously want to, you'd have thought they'd have made sure their 'fault bot' actually works. We reported a fault using the automated service and when no-one turned up we checked with a real person - they had no record of the fault. What a shower."
Phil,Bardsey,12/6/21,"We are held hostage to the incompetence, unreliability and deplorably poor service from Bloody Terrible (BT)
The norm is for them to wrongly schedule in a repair engineer and then fail to show - over charge by 100% per month and gaslight you when you try to get them to correct their mistakes
Our ‘super-fast’Wifi is super slow and regularly drops out. Yet they charge more and wrongly advertise that they have the best service. They really have the worst service
NEVER get BT - they simply do not care and treat you with contempt and then try to upswell to you when you complain
It’s shocking that the spectacularly Open Reach service provider us the same supplier to 90% of Telecomms firms. That is simply a corrupt and massively inefficient monopoly"
Natalie,Here,12/4/21,"Terrible, the speeds and stuff are fine, but the router goes of about 20 times every 2 hours

Don't use bt."
Sue Y,"Crawleyside, Stanhope",11/30/21,"Planned our entire house move around when BT could connect us, only to find on the day out that “significant work” needs doing to the cabinet. Surely they knew this when the accepted our business? As we both work from home, connection is vital. Now we’re unable to work. Thanks BT."
Lorcan Butler,Newtownards,11/28/21,"Woeful, abysmal customer service. They wanted me to return the router as they were sending me a new one. kept getting constant texts to return the old router. Had to phone customer services numerous times to get jiffy bag to send it back. BT store in local shopping centre didnt have 
them. Got proof of postage from post office. The texts still kept on coming, then a final bill for £50 for not returning the kit. Absolute Joke, stay away from them, customer service are awful they don't care one bit about you or your problems. Line speed good and and at speeds as advertised,
 but would never return on principle. Please give them a huge swerve and go elsewhere."
Nicole,Gloucestershire,11/24/21,BT have the worst customer service I have ever come across. No one in their many offices are properly trained or know what they are doing. We have had problems from the very start. Kept being told different things. Engineers either not turning up for appointments or knocking on the door to come inside to check equipment. I will never recommend this company and will always discourage anyone (even my enemies) from using BT.
Sanjay,,11/24/21,Overall my experience has been good. (we haven't used it for gaming/heavy browsing)
ELISHA,TOTNES,11/22/21,Bt are awful - terrible communication. I wanted to leave then offered another contract low price with nothing said about being charged over £200. Honestly avoid use another
Safirul,wakefield,11/19/21,"Very poor service inspite of being with BT for many years.They will start troubling your broadband if you move to a new provider at least for week or 10 days before the move.
Absolutely rubbish customer service"
Keith Davies,Stockport,11/14/21,Shambles of a company. I couldn`t use the Broadband due to unforseen circumstances. Bt said no problem they would send a return bag for the router and there would be no charges. 3 months and 3 phone calls later i have been charged £50 with no return bag sent. I have asked for a return address to send the kit back but they won`t give me one. Total rip off company
Benjamin,Kirkcaldy,11/14/21,"The service they provide is not close to that which is advertised. The internet speed is shockingly bad and periodically goes down for whole weekends. We have complained many times, however, their customer assistants are useless and unable to help in the slightest. One of the poorest service providers i have ever been with. Would not recommend to anyone who cares about broadband speed, consistency or customer care."
Nick Drew,"Surrey, UK",11/12/21,"Existing BT customer here, just looking to change the point the internet cable comes into the house, as part of a refurb. Organised a date with BT 2 weeks ago for an engineer to come and do this.

We were given a window of 8am-1pm. No one here by 12.30, so we rang BT customer services and were promised an engineer was on their way and were just held-up. My wife stayed in for the rest of the afternoon, with our 3 young boys, holding up the refurb work, only for no engineer to appear.

We ring BT this evening to understand how no one can appear and how the guidance at midday was that someone was on their way, only to be told that this was booked as a remote service and no one was ever going to come.

Absolutely shocking service. Building works held-up and can’t even find an apology, let alone a suitable revised date for the work.

Will now be leaving the service and would strongly recommend anyone assessing different suppliers to avoid BT. Their service is shockingly bad for such a high profile company."
William,Reading,11/9/21,Went for a deal with free Fitbit and ‘Great Wi-Fi’ in every room. 3 months on no Fitbit with no help from customer service after several calls and emails. Multiple rooms without any Wi-Fi even though they are 10 meters away from the main Hub.
N Pillai,Sutton Coldfield,11/9/21,"I have taken BT superfibre connection to my work from home. It is the worst decision I made. There was an inordinate delay in getting the connection. (Then 3 blokes came in 3 vans to put ONE wire from the road to the house. One did the work the other 2 merrily chatting away) I wish Virgin was available in my area ! The speed is supposed to be 300Mb, I hardly get 50 MB. When I call BT they insist the connection is fine. The connection is unstable at best and often I cannot connect 2 devices let alone what is said in their ad! Can Britain not have better internet than this?"
ralph cater,york,11/9/21,having switched from sky to b t i can not return to sky quickly enough The whole experience with B T has been dire broadbad wont connect poor set up by engineer phone line wont work hours and hours on the phone and computer when they did manage to provide a service BAD BAD BAD
My name,Peterborough,11/8/21,"Even putting 1 star is better than they deserve. The absolute worst internet I have ever had. Internet speeds ( by them ) were 15mb lower than they said, and my tests were absolutely disgraceful. I work from home so need a stable connection, however it has been impossible to do ANYTHING. Internet speeds showing a whopping 1mb/s (if that sometimes) pages taking years to load, youtube videos buffering on 240p. I have had to work from my friends house the last 2 weeks because of this and it's totally unacceptable. Never ever using BT again, the service is an absolute joke."
Millar,Scotland,11/8/21,"Exceptionally poor customer service, I would strongly advise anyone who is seeking a positive outcome and customer satisfaction to look elsewhere, I have been a loyal customer to BT over the last 24 Months paying my direct debts on time and enjoying the service until I made a short term transition into another property one in which the duration was going to be 3 months at the end of this period my service was going to cease, I made this very clear to BT. I have now been hit with an unexpected charge because of the move, I made it very clear to BT that this transition was going to be 3 months so why lie to a loyal customer and not make that loyal customer aware of the line rental charges, a company who supposedly puts ""customers first"" one of their core values, I am now starting to realise why BT do not advertise their Trustpilot score. Because of this experience, I will never recommend BT or any of BT's products to friends or family and I recommend anyone who is reading this to seek an alternative supplier and products."
Grafton,UK,11/4/21,"The absolute worst. Broadband installation is 38 days overdue after a 3 week delay between account setup and the installation. The only time I get updates is when I call, and some unfortunate (very kind) customer service person has explains that they plan to do it in the next week. They never do. Recommend just about anyone else. Truly awful experience, making working from home and moving house an absolute nightmare."
Ciber,ABINGDON,11/4/21,"This has been by far the worst service I have received from a broadband and tv box provider.
1- The TV Box and hub did not arrive until a week later than the starting date and they did not modify the starting date.
2- I was promised the big sport package which includes HD channels and had to call 2 times where they said the problem was fixed but it was not. The guys who talked to me did not what were they talking about.
3- The third time I get to talk to someone who knows what was talking about. Also, the problem with my tv changed as well so to see HD channels it was asking to upgrade subscription. When I talk to the BT specialist he agreed that I should have HD but that it was not assigned and that I would have to pay extra money to get it. That is when I decided to cancel. Luckily enough I still was within the 14 days free cancelation Do not want to know about BT ever again.
3- The sales guy that promise the package for a certain price was a scam. I honestly do not know how this service can get worst."
Pat,London,11/3/21,Absolutely shocking reliability. The worst broadband connection I have ever had. Am moving to Community Fiber
Simon,St Albans,11/3/21,"Texted BT am as no house phone or internet. Got automated message saying up to 48hrs to fix. Just 2hrs later engineers attended and fixed fault in street machinery. Everything working perfectly. Can only speak as I find, brilliant service."
Ovidiu Nicolae,london,10/26/21,"I have been stuck with BT for a good part of 2 years (almost). Although the speeds were decent enough for the package I had, the termination of my contract resulted in the worst possible ruckus - long story short; the chat team does not know a thing about how to terminate a contract and there is a lack of communication between various sections. I had to waste 3 mornings (2 weeks distance apart) to get someone to place a return order of my router and have my account cancel on my requested date - And when that was done I found out (a month after) that I was still resulting a regular customer and paying the bills regularly...terrified of having to set up an account with them ever again."
swfcapslock,scotland,10/25/21,"normally i leave a bad company at 1 star but this is completely abysmal. rating this 1 star would be generous considering what you actually get from BT. we get our first BT router a few years back, signed for a year or 2 since they promised good connection. nope! couldn't even connect to stuff as simple as video or online meeting. so we phoned them up and asked for an engineer and the engineer came. the engineer promised high speeds and set us up onto the ""fastest connection possible"". looking back on that, i almost fell out of my chair laughing with how false that was. nothing improved and they charged us anyways without any reason or explanation as to why nothing improved. naturally, we called again and got set up with new internet. this has been a bit better but not much. not to mention, there's zero point reaching out to the support team since they're as about as useful as a rock and will just keep you on an endless loop while being as passive-aggressive as humanly possible. horrible company."
Wong,London,10/23/21,"BT boardband unstable and bad customer service. They expect their customers work around their BT engineers schedule not customers. BT seems to think their customers can take time off work for their engineers. I don't understand that why BT engineers are not at services at weekend or evening. Their fault team is a joke, no customer services at all. Telling me there was no fault when I have no wifi for a few days, then told me not to talk over him when he was the one kept interrupting me talking. Shocking bad services at their fault team. BT management needs to do better to provide some basic infrastructure to the UK public."
Iulian,Liverpool,10/22/21,"Worst broadband u can have!

I had a contract with them when I was living in Luton, was ok...ish

But here, In Liverpool is pure ****! In weekend is not working at all and during the week I have max 2.8 mb/s so is useless!
I am thinking to make a claim because they don't give me what they said in the contract I will get.

Waste of money"
Davo,Somerset,10/21/21,"Absolutely awful! Paid for full fibre 900
Yes 900 to the hub, then a fluctuating poor WiFi, literally often less than 20mb.
After 2 hubs and endless calls from bt I bring home my hub from work, a different make (draytec) Absolutely fine, stable, reliable 700 give or take WiFi.. so in short if you want full fibre then expect to pay out for a hub/router that performs
Really really shocking how bad bt hub is"
Ross,Kirkcaldy,10/19/21,Broadband is reliably slow!! Virgin is x30 faster than by in my area ???
Charlie B,Oxfordshire,10/18/21,"Absolutely disgusting concept of customer service. Was mis-sold a product that was supposed to provide us with internet until an engineer could come out, that then apparently couldn't be provided until after the service had been connected. What a complete waste of time. The people I had the misfortune of dealing with were unpleasant, argumentative and generally unhelpful, wasting an hour and a half of my afternoon for basically no resolution because everyone is busy blaming each other. Communication is poor and aggressive, and the overall experience makes me severely regret choosing to go with BT at all"
Adam,Essex,10/13/21,"Really don’t know what to say! Had high expectations of bt but they were quickly shattered!
The speeds are decent…. normally…. Up to 130mbs when plugged in to ethernet however the ping/ latency is shocking! It bounces between 4-500+
This makes online gaming extremely frustrating and basically unplayable at some times with being kicked out of games randomly, major lag and certain apps just simply not working. This is console and mobile games. My phone signal is non existent so I’m connected to wifi. When on a call the call often drops. Ironically this has happened multiple times when on the phone to bt. I’ve had them send me multiple external devices which have done nothing. Had engineers come over with the wrong information to begin with then when explaining the problem their response was that they are not trained in latency so they can’t help and proceeded to call the bt call centre and go through options that i’ve already been through multiple times.
Incredibly poor and frustrating service! Can’t wait to leave and never come back!
Shame on you bt! After reading all these other reviews I honestly can’t believe how bad your service actually is across the country!"
Franco,Livingston,10/9/21,"The worst company eveeeeeer. Problems for 2 months for instalation, later charging me more than they should and extending my ending contract date without any reason. Then calling to finish it and they didn't tell me nothing I needed to send back my router, after month a half receiving email saying if I don't send it back I will get charged after I moved already to another city. Very bad costumer service and Internet working very slow. Never again"
Jaskirat kaur,Bishop auckland,10/1/21,I am very unhappy with bt . They donot understand a single word . I just moved othe place from house to flat and i just call them change bt stuff there . I just leaving in flat and downstairs is a fish shop and what these stupid people done they shift my broadband to the fish shop . And the fish shop business account they stop. They are worse than 5 year old kid . Really very unhappy ☹️ its worst day in my life when i choose this broadband never ever come to this broadband again and also tell about stupidness to others as well. Never tell anyone to have this broadband . Very stupid stafff of bt . The fish got very big losss
Nat,Great Missenden,10/1/21,"Completely unacceptable! I have waited three weeks for my broadband to be installed on 29th of September. No one turned up and I called BT 10min past the scheduled time saying that no one turned up. Now I have to wait another two weeks for the next available appointment, because the technician said that he came to the address, was told that the resident was not aware of any installation and left! I called 10 min after his appointment! Obviously, he just got lost and went to the wrong address and couldn’t be bothered to find the right one! Now I’m suffering for his incompetence! BT just doesn’t care about their customers.... absolutely disgraceful..."
John,Belfast,9/29/21,"WARNING
IF YOU ARE SEEKING ANY LEVEL OF SERVICE DO NOT ENGAGE WITH BT
Today is 29.9.21 I received a message from BT stating that my installation date has been delayed by 7 days to 13.10.21.
This shouldn't be the biggest deal in the world and wouldn't if it weren't for the fact that I placed the order on 17.4.21.
I get the feeling that they're actually aiming to drag it out for a full six months to wear it as a badge of honour.
I have spent over 15 hours on hold. I have been billed monthly for a service I don't receive and have had complaints closed down without any rhyme nor reason. The communication network is set up so you can't have a single point of contact so when they promise this, that promise is made in the full knowledge that they cannot be acting in good faith"
Sarah Kurkdji,london,9/28/21,
James Diffley,Edinburgh,9/27/21,"This is the most abysmal customer service I have ever experienced. After signing up for broadband our WiFi abruptly cut out after 2 weeks. We contacted BT customer service and tried to get an explanation. They told us that the account had been declared void by a computer error.
Instead of helping us they shunted us between different customer service departments and offered no solutions. We were told 3 times that a manager would contact us within 3 hours, but 3 times we were ignored.
BT then told us that we had to re-create our account and re-install wifi. They refused to move up appointments , meaning that we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer to come out. I am a key worker, who works primarily with children with barriers to learning who have been adversely affected by covid 19, and my partner is studying for her PHD. Both of our day to day lives have been significantly disrupted.
BT’s solution for this was to tell us to contact ANOTHER WiFi provider to get a Dongle, which they assured us they would re-reimburse us for. So far we have heard nothing. In summation, we are £120 out of pocket with no WiFi to date."
Minvydas Vegele,"Brentwood, UK",9/27/21,
Robin,Brownhills,9/26/21,"Possibly, nope definitely the worst company to be with. When i have managed to get through to customer service, i have been spoken to like a piece of rubbish. The internet is rubbish and when some one calls the house phone the internet goes off. If Virgin were in the street i would be happy to pay the extra and go with them. I would not recommend BT to any one, a total waste of time."
Carol Mcgrann,Liverpool,9/23/21,Never got equipment. Order was frozen . Ended up staying with virgin .was not told order was frozen
Ed,Glos,9/22/21,"Don't be fooled by the speed guarantees from BT. I have 900mbps full fibre to home. The max I get is around 230mbps but this varies to as low as 10mpbs frequently.

This has been raised multiple times with BT who have said they only guarantee the speed to the house. What their hubs pump out is NOT guaranteed. So far:
- I've spent hours on the phone to support (even longer on hold)
- I'm on my 5th hub, all the same issue
- Have been sent 3 discs. Same issue.
- Engineer came out and confirmed their was an issue. He couldn't fix it and said I need an SITF?? engineer to check wifi issues.
- I've had 2 Openreach engineers, who also confirmed there was a problem but couldn't fix it. They suggested I get a new hub with the latest firmware.
- Had to call up and order new hub, delivered but same problem.
- Booked MOT check and the original engineer came out who said the same thing as before. Couldn't fix it and I need SITF engineer.

ps I live in a detached new build house. The walls are paper thin and there is nothing around that would cause any significant wifi interference.

I'm not getting speeds anywhere near what was offered upon purchase and I feel the package was miss sold."
Peter,FAREHAM,9/21/21,"Completely hopeless at everything. I gave up with them, having spent 4 hours on the phone in 2 days trying to spend money with them!"
Ian Hurst,Sheffield,9/18/21,"This is the first bad review I've actively given besides the odd verbal comment in 32 years, the customer service and situation I have been left in as a BT customer is disgusting.

Two nights ago around 10pm I received 3 emails all at once stating my WiFi would be shut off and account closed, a few minutes later the WiFi was off.

I called the next day to find out what had happened as I'd never missed a payment and had a package deal through EE, I was informed I'd not payed a £11.13 charge for installation 4 month prior which was confusing, I'd never had an installation as the landline had been in and working for years. How've after looking back I did find the email with the charge so after paying £92 with extra charges I was told I could have the WiFi back on.... Only to then be told my account has been closed anyway, I was then asked to return my hub and that if I wanted to continue with my service I might be given a more expensive plan, I was then told if I wanted to cancel I would have to pay cancellation charges for the remainder of my contract which was 18 months. After trying to explain I didn't want to cancel my contract you cancelled on me and that I wanted it to keep working as before I was then told to call back tomorrow afternoon sometime around 3pm and speak to the sales team.

The conversation the next day turned out to be a positive one with the customer service person saying i can start a new contract exactly the same as the old one and have you up and running straight away, wait 10 minutes for a confirmation email then that's everything...

The email informed me that I was being charged another £40 connection charge, £9.95 delivery for a new hub which would arrive in 11 days, as someone who works from home my business cannot function without using the internet and while still being charged for an account that I've never missed a payment on and still having the original hub plugged in flashing purple I'm left feeling utterly defeated and unable to earn a living.

Again this is the first negative review I have ever left but it took a mighty difficult situation to do so, apologies if I've waffled on but this company is horrendous.

For anyone reading this you'd be better off signing up with THREE"
Louise,Folkestone,9/14/21,"Not reliable, they had to give me a refund in the past as broadband not working. Yet again it failed today and no way to get access. This could last at least 2 days. Terrible customer service. I will go to another provider the moment that I get out of my contract!"
Gemma,Bradford,9/10/21,Waited in for an engineer and nobody turned up then rebooked the appointment and the same happened again! Still haven’t got internet and they said there’s nothing they can do just book again.
Clara,London,9/10/21,Terrible costumer service. Wasted 1.5h setting up a contract. They misspelled the address and now they are asking me to redo all 1.5h of setting up a new contract. They can not change a simple details THEY got wrong. Ridiculous.
Bob,Birmingham,9/9/21,Waste of time you don’t get any where near the speeds you pay for. The customer service is awful put simply don’t bother
JB,Datchet,9/9/21,Absolutely irresponsible service. The engineers didn’t turn up on the date I have been given. When I called BT customer service they don’t have any clue/ they did not contact the open reach. The date I was given was 3 weeks after order — very delayed set up dates.Even after waiting 3 weeks nothing has been done by them. Then they have me another 3 weeks time. Which means 6 weeks for installation. No communication from them. I had to call millions of time to understand what’s happening. And when you call each person come up with differing information. Basically I fed up with the long wait and moved to virgin. They gave me 1 week time to set up. Let’s see what virgin can do!
Bethany Seddon,Preston,9/7/21,Waited over a month for a refunded bill. Refunded me £5! Had to to ring multiple times this week to chase and get my full refund of £40 to be told today I would be receiving it by check in the next 10 days. Quick enough to take it tho! I cancelled within the first week coz your engineer couldn't be bothered to fit the router in my living room and left wires all over the floor when I have a 1 year old and a puppy. Nothing but hard work. Wouldn't advise anybody to use BT
Christopher Martin,Cleveleys,9/2/21,"Absolutely vile to go for. Awaited for 3 weeks now. Got our first appointment last week and the engineer could be bothered coming out, got told we had been booked in yesterday 1/09/2021 and they changed it to today 2/9/2021. To then find out the engineer has not been bothered to come out again. Had a text to say they will review and book me in for a couple weeks time. We live in an area of no service and need internet and when they make 4 failed promises on us and don’t stick to their agreements it makes me think is the owner actually disabled? Does he has something wrong with him? They’re lying scumbags who just want your money and won’t provide a service. I’ve got better chance of having a gangbang with the hottest pornstars than them following through with their promises. Ugly little turds."
Andy,Tunstall,8/31/21,"Overall I have been very satisfied with the broadband both it's speed and reliability. But I can't give a rating for the customer service as it is almost non existent. Up to this year I have never had any issue but since June this year after making a complaint BT have given nothing in the way of customer service. They keep using the excuse of the pandemic but that is all it is, an excuse for not keeping in contact with loyal customers. Very poor."
Tris,Aberdeen,8/29/21,Worst customer service I have ever had on the phone for 40 mins and hang up then act like its your fault for not phoning! Absolutely awful company overcharge for rubbish service and make you pay when there is no WiFi
Reza,Uckfield,8/26/21,"You have to wait for them one month to come and install but when you are waiting for them they put your appointment 15 days later without telling you, after two month since I ordered I had to order another broadband.worst customer service,"
JOHN,NEWCASTLE,8/25/21,"A few years ago, my BT Internet was really bad. It was never good but it became so awful I was getting less than 1MB. This is over about 5 months. Sometimes no internet at all. I complained numerous times to BT. I was lied to. I was ignored, and when I told them they had to sort my Internet out, or I'd leave, they arranged for a BT engineer to call at my house. I waited in all day. He never came. I had to stay off work for that visit and when I rang BT to complain, they told me an appointment hadn't even been booked. I was furious. I'd had enough of their lies and very poor 'service'. I left BT and subscribed to my internet elsewhere. Before doing that I asked if I owed BT any money and they said no. In fact they owed me 3p. I left it at that. A year down the line I got a letter from a debt collector saying that they were representing BT and the 'DEBT' I had incurred with them. Apparently just after leaving, BT had slapped a £420 fine for leaving 'out of contract'. Yet for me they BROKE the contract by not supplying a service. I was outraged. I finally had to pay the 'debt' because it went to the County Court. I had never had any outstanding debts in my life. But that filthy dirty company BT made me into someone who has a debt collector on his back, and now I have a black mark on my credit report. Disgusting, appalling. And I had to pay £420 plus COURT costs. AVOID!"
Alan McEwan,Paisley,8/24/21,Shambles from tech support to chat support. False promises on new hub delivery times and costing me more money... almost as if it was a strategy to make more out of existing companies. I've lost trust
Emma Summers,Solihull,8/22/21,"Worst wifi ever, dosent even work properly cuts out every few minutes if i could rate it no stars i would.just because every other company buys there supplies from here dosent mean its a good company. sort your wifi out we switched from sky because its cheaper to use BT, but definatley wasnt worth swapping, the wifi and signal has never been so bad ever. had to buy 8 boosters that dont do anything either, waste of your money"
Pauline,Scotland,8/20/21,"Dealing with BT was a frustrating and futile experience from start to finish. Two months after signing up for an ultrafast fibre to the premises (FTTP) service, I had to cancel my contract as BT had utterly failed to install the service. They blamed Openreach whom they said were going to replace a telegraph pole as the existing telegraph pole was alleged to be unsafe for the engineer to climb.
At first I was given “ a 100% guarantee” this would be done within two weeks of the original installation date, then given a series of other dates by which this work was to be done, but nothing ever happened by any of these dates.
I asked to speak to a BT manager, this was refused, i made a complaint, nothing was done. I asked to speak directly to Openreach, this too was refused. BT never got in touch with me to explain what was going on at any point, I had to phone them repeatedly. Every piece of information BT gave me was incorrect. It became clear that Openreach had no intention at all of replacing the telegraph pole. Even now, BT continue to advertise that FTTP is available in this area despite knowing it isn’t as it can’t be installed due to openreach engineers refusing to climb the old telegraph pole and Openreach having no intention of doing anything about this
I had to keep extending an expensive older broadband throughout this period with no apology or compensation offered by BT.
A miserable experience a from a dreadful company."
anthony mcmahon,liverpool uk,8/19/21,"I am raising this complaint in regards. two days waiting for a delivery from BT, 1st day i receive a email that phone be delivered between 8am and 9am i live in 3 story flat facing the front, no sign of a dpd van, then i received a email telling me i missed him, i dont know were the driver is but he sent me a photo of a bungalow i am in a 3 story flat, today same again delivery between 11.30 to 12.30 today not showed again, i rang dpd liverpool who advised me he is in the wrong place and advise it will be delivered, not shown up, yet again. i cancel a hospital appointment because dpd liverpool told me it will be delivered today 7.30pm no show again, i have been onto BT and cancelled the item plus all products i have with BT as this has happen before and had to pick the items up from depot, i am not doing it this time, the name of the drive is marcus and because of this i lost 2 days sitting around for item that never showed up,Know spoken to BT and terminated all product, if they cannot get a proper delivery service i have nothing to do with them, i have a lot of items deliver through hermes without any problems, the driver did not attempt to ring if he was not sure were it was, know it costed me time and costed BT now everything i have with BT is going back, you company does not provide a service it provides a headache for its customers. i will be posting on social media as to whats happened and seeking advise regarding wasting my time and and a numberof telephone calls to liverpool office, i await you answer as BT will have question to ask yourselves. when is bt going to realise there losing money and wasting ppl's time"
Marco Loureiro,South Elmsall,8/15/21,"It's the worst thing I've never experienced. For the past few months I had a nightmare with this ****** company. I nearly got fired because of you're internet conection. They promised me that I would have minimum of 5MB/s and I have 0.8MB/s, I've opened 5 complains about this and no one cares as they said: there's nothing we can do about it. They've charged me for a things that I no longer have. They're the worst. If you need a broadband, do not choose BT."
Rob Kent,East Sussex,8/11/21,"Its hard to rate a company that offers such a blend of incompetence and dishonesty. If they tell you a thing will be delivered on a date it wont be, when they assure you they are sorry they are not. They are so useless its to the point when you think it would be less effort to be do the job right"
Pauline,Hastings,8/11/21,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I made two complaints and both completely ignored. Having set up a new BT broadband service 2 weeks prior to my move in date there was some difficulty receiving the equipment. After waiting for the service start date it didnt work. I phoned help service and after 2 hours talk to different staff was told the service had been cancelled because the previous BT customer at that address refused to let me take over the line. BT did not inform me, and then I got a threatening letter telling me to return the equipment or I would be charged. I logged complaint and was told someine would call me. Nobody called. Another 2 hour phonecall from me and a second complaint resulted in new service being ordered, and told I needed a whole new set of equipment, and send the first lot back and wait 11 days for connection. I was told there would be a £20 goodwill credit and be offered compensation for dreadful service, but no evidence of this. Service now working, no contact re complaints,deamands to send initial equipment back even though no prepaid envelope received, and demands for payment even though I set up a direct debit initially. Complaint now going to ombudsman and once contract us up I will never use BT again, be warned they are the worst customer service ever."
Paul Johnson,Wrexham,8/3/21,"The one star are courtesy of the review site not me.. Appalling service fault still not fixed over a week after reporting it.. Response ""we wilo send out an engineer to fix it ince and for all??? What did the last engineer do play games??? Talk talk are bad but at least you pay less for poor or non service.. BT don't care"
James,High Wycombe,8/3/21,"3 weeks and counting without broadband after switch from Sky to BT.

Spent over 6 hours in total on hold on the phone. Absolutely terrible customer service, feel like im being constantly fobbed off and lied to over the phone."
Mohamed,London,7/26/21,"Going for BT was the worst decision that i made
Very disappointed
The strange thing that I ve been disappointed twice ! One in my business broadband and last one here in my house !!!!!
Very poor support very poor customer service
Their big name now is clearly for me is a big scam !"
Chen Gao,london,7/25/21,"They cannot even successfully deliver their package to your address!!! I booked Halo 3 on July 9th, but I never received it from that day. Royal Mail said that my address is wrong because BT gave them wrong address. I contacted BT's customer support by phone nearly twenty times, everyone said he can help me, but finally, they didn't correctly change my address. It's supprizing that they continuely make the same mistake so many times. It looks that they realy doesn't care about their client. I've had enough with BT. Never use it again!"
Alan McClary,Penzance,7/25/21,"I have been with BT business for almost a year and that is a year too long. I had problems with BT for about three months before I was even signed up. When they eventually installed my broadband they did not connect the line at the exchange, so the only broadband I was getting was either through a BT hotspot or the 4G dongle. After hours on the phone and online chat, they discovered their mistake but all the offered for being 8 months without proper broadband was £25 off my bill.
I will be leaving BT as soon as my contrack expires and not a single day later."
Tom,Ormskirk,7/15/21,"Absolutely atrocious service.
Our internet has been offline for about a month. On the best of days we get a download speed of 1MB/s and upload speed of 0.3MB/s. We were promised at least 1.5MB/s. We are paying a ridiculous amount for our broadband. It’s ridiculous how we can be charged the same amount as someone who gets fibre optic with a broadband speed > 30 MB/s, so x30 more than what we get.
Openreach have been attempting to fix our internet for about 3 weeks, but it is still not working. Our poles have not had any service/maintenance since 2001 according to one of their engineers.
They have offered compensation of £8 per day until our internet is back up and running. This might cover the cost of the monthly broadband fee… but what about all other services we pay for that require WiFi, such as Netflix, Amazon prime, Alexa, etc?
I believe that the government were targeting for the whole of the UK to get a minimum broadband speed of 10MB/s to all homes by 2020. Clearly they have failed to keep to this promise. To make things worse, there doesn’t seem to be any urgency or reassurance that they are actually trying to achieve that target anytime soon. They dismiss any possibility of fibre optic to our area.
It’s such a shame that there are no other providers that we can turn to, otherwise we would have years ago.
If you are thinking of using BT as your main provider, I urge you to do some research and check other providers first - I believe Virgin have their own boxes therefore they can offer a different internet line to your home."
Alex,Kent,7/15/21,"Worst company I have ever dealt with.

I had an issue with my broadband that kept dropping up to 7 times a day and then 5Mbps speeds. Me and my partner both work at home and found this impossible.
However BT could only send us engineers. After 10 engineer visits and 12 hours of calls to and from BT the outcome was to leave free of charge however no compensation was applied. My stress levels dealing with this company has been more than ever in my life to the point where I had sleepless nights worrying about the integrity of my job but BT weren’t having none of it."
Wisam,WEST WICKHAM,7/14/21,Engineer didn't show up for the activation. They sent me his number in the morning to contact him - he didn't reply to calls nor txt. Supposed to come between 8-1. Then was contacted by the company that arranges the engineer's visits to say that he will come round. - waited til 6pm - nothing. No response to txt nor calls. Then BT called in the evening saying the need to rearrange the appointment. Not so much an issue if you don't work but I have to take another day off work and being self employed it's loss of earnings.
Vivek,London,7/9/21,"Very bad customer service.
BT broadband sales did the credit check and all then letting me know that the broadband installation at my house will be done after three months. It is ridiculous. Complete waste of time"
Ryan,Colchester,7/8/21,"Absolutely amazing for many many years, the introduction of BT Fibre was a game changer download speeds were very fast after the fact."
Ioana,Bristol,7/8/21,"Please avoid.
My second experience with BT after 4 years. Nothing has changed, they just advertise better. We pay £30 pm to have a 4mb speed. We have not gone over 10 mb since we started the contract 2 months ago.
Called support, they said we will get a 4G hub to help with the connexion - never came. Apparently you have to pay for accessories to get the most basic service that you were already paying for....? what?! no thanks.
engineers have come out twice and both times the conclusion was: the cable is eroded. We asked for it to be changed, they refused and said, we'll try something with the box outside. Obviously, nothing has happened and we are now waiting for the 3rd round of engineer, while still paying for a service that does not work. Super.

Please avoid. Get Virgin, it's just as bad."
Saima,London,7/6/21,"Customer service was excellent - I was served by someone names Sebastian, really helped me in ensuring my internet was fixed and polite too"
Alastair,Caerphilly,7/5/21,"2 appointments not attended, delayed our office opening for 2 weeks and counting. The first appointment was booked for Thursday the 24th of June, the engineer just didn't turn up. Our office was due to open 28th June but couldn't as VOIP phones and no internet! They then booked an appointment for Friday 2nd..... didn't turn up again. Called again this morning 5th July, they cant look for another appointment until 8th July..... so we will be at least two weeks of having people not able to work. You just can't trust this business. UPDATE we now have the next available appointment for 13th July. So 19 days after it should have been. Hopefully 3rd time lucky!"
Rob,Penkridge,7/4/21,Waiting 3 months and no words can describe how bad your company is. You take my money but I nearly lose my job because of you crooks. How the hell ate you still in business
annon,Mordoor,7/4/21,I can sneeze and interupt the signal. It's weak.
Georgia Ravenscroft,Colchester,7/1/21,STAY WELL AWARE AT ALL COST. Broadband is terrible. I called customer service and after being on hold for two hours I told them I want to end my contract because I’m moving to Sky. They said ok there will be a fee of £94. I paid the fee and a few days later they wanted another £125. Will not pay. They can send the queen of England to my door for all I care. There broadband is terrible always freezing and I will tell everyone I know to never get. One day hope this company has to close down.
Bri,Woking,6/30/21,"Absolutely terrible and criminal customer care! At least Dick Turpin wore a mask! Arranged a house move, internet should have been on since 17 Jun 21 but instead they switched it off! Numerous phone calls being passed from department to department where staff lie on the phone, fob you off and even huff when calling them as I must have disturbed them doing nothing whilst working from home. Now three weeks since they should have switched on my broadband they continue to aviod explaining the issue saying ""it's a supplier issue"" and telling me I am stuck in a contract with them when they have failed to even start the service. If an individual done this, they would be a fraudster, so BT, you are a company of fraudsters. Customers beware, AVIOD BT WITH A BARGEPOLE. You will not acknowledge any of my calls for three weeks now maybe some honest reviews may force you to review your customer care policies!"
John,Telford,6/22/21,Only able to contact during daytime hours yet its always at night the internet goes down - a regular occurance - very unreliable and often due to 'service' maintenance they seem to do most nights and so by time you can call to complain its back on and their customer spport is aweful and do not want to know that yt again you were withoout internet all through the night
Schilly,Scotland,6/18/21,"I'd rate my experience ZERO if I could. Ordered mid April... it’s now mid June. Initial activation date was cancelled as more work needed. BT lied over & over again, and tried to fob me off. Complaint is ongoing.
Despite OpenReach surveying, planning visiting twice, complex engineering taking the line to the adjacent property, the engineer (who didn’t turn up for the initial appointment) failed to actually take the line into, was is under 15m, to the property. Gross incompetence!
Numerous calls with BT to try to get the problem sorted and then receive an email, and SMS, to say my line has been ‘Activated’, ‘Ready to Use’ and BT 'Hope I'm enjoying it'. As OpenReach and BT have closed the matter, all BT can do is raise it as a 'fault'. A fault on a line I don't even have! Presumably I will now be charged for a line I don't have. Now it's beyond GROSS INCOMPETENCE.. it's unbelievable. BT Customer service worse than useless!"
Alan,Bangor,6/16/21,
JamesGame,London,6/15/21,"BT reuse to let me leave without paying the rest of my contract fees despite not giving me the service I signed up for. To leave I must pay £197. I have a ADSL Internet connection which, despite ridiculously slow upload and download speeds which I tolerate, continually loses connection and displays the dreaded ‘yellow light’ on my router signalling a loss of service, REPEATEDLY, 10-20 times a day!! BT offered many ‘workaround’ fixes, free phone data, new routers (x3), engineer visits etc. After my need for a better connection became essential due to large file upload/download for work, up to 6GB+, I decided to leave BT and join Virgin Media which was cheaper and has impressively fast fibre broadband in my area. BT then claim, what for it, that my loss of Internet connection isn’t technically a ‘drop’ in service and happens simply because the accompanying landline has a fault on it!! I explained, it doesn’t matter what or where the source or location of the problem is, all that matters is I’m not receiving the service I should be. To which they respond with their final word on the matter (after long debates and endless transferring from department to department) that my Internet has only ever ‘dropped’ connection twice during the last year and has always been ‘provided’ otherwise and it’s the problem with my landline that causes the problem with the Internet connection at my end, and therefor, because they’ve continued to provide broadband at the speed contractually agreed upon from their end, I am not free to leave without paying the rest of my contract!! Can you believe it!! I said it doesn’t matter what you provide at your end, what matters is what I receive at my end, AND I RECEIVE REPEATED DROPS IN SERVICE!!! I DO NOT CARE WHAT PART OF YOUR SERVICE/NETWORK IS BROKEN, I DO NOT RECEIVE THE SERVICE I PAY FOR AND I WANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT BEING CHARGED £197 TO DO SO!!
BT refuse to budge so I must pay £197 to leave a broadband contract that is regularly interrupted by a fault on the accompanying landline. What can I say except, BT, shame on you, after my years of loyalty, you treat me like this, SHAME ON YOU!!"
MU,Chelmsford,6/15/21,BT's service is appalling to the point of being fraudulent. I have had 9 visits by incompetent workmen who in most cases could not complete the work they came to do. I have also had 2 appointments cancelled without any notification. It's now 4 months since I started the contract and I still do not have the full service I paid for. Customer service is unhelpful and do not care if your installation is working but are only concerned with your payments. I have been lied to about the cost of the service and given incorrect information about future increases. I believe they are knowingly defrauding elderly users such as myself and I will be reporting BT to Ofcom.
Anonymous,Clacton,6/14/21,Worst company ever. Costumer service agents are rude and liars upgrade you with out permission. Will not recommend to my worst enemy
Patricia Marchand,CM1 2EH,6/14/21,"Joined only 4 months ago.
For 1st 20 days of joining speed was great, then nothing though new installation of fibre plus.
Then sent me what they called a 'techy' who told me it was because my broadband 'bounces' on my walls, but if I pay more my services 'might' get better.
In other words blackmail me to pay more to stop problems.
I then knew I had to leave them.
They really should be fined.
Found BT insulting.
Obviously badly managed."
Dominic Rea,Littleborough,6/14/21,"My advice is not to commit to 2 year deals because they will screw you at the end if you cancel early, even with a house move."
A causer,Telford,6/11/21,"This is what i have just sent to BT, the woman on the phone yesterday was horrible, actually shouting at me in the phone , she was incredibly number is 07966045386
I can not believe what you have done, i am already being treated for stress and acute depresion
Yesterday you cut off my broadband
I now have no tv
I can not use my phone

My son works from home and you have stopped him from working

2 weeks ago i phoned to talk about my bill
I tealised i was still paying for a landline package of unlimited calls etc
I had stated and phoned numerous times about the fact i had no land phone , i didnt want a phone but yet you continued billing me for 2 years.
The man on the phone said the best ge could do was refund me £60
And send me a new hub, i still had a bill outstanding and told him my house was going to auction and i woukd clear my bill very soon
Yesterday i phoned to clear my bill , the lady said my wifi was still open but about to be closed down, i had no onowledge of this , only aeare i had to change my hub over which i did yesterday.
I had not been refunded the £60 and my bill had not changed, i paid all outstanding bill of over £100
The lady then put me through to someone else who told me i had been cut off and i would have to open a new account
I have been with you for over 35 years, and now you have caused me to be very ill, and for my son not to be able to work, without even contacting me
I am on the vulnerable list which you should have been aware of
What you have done has totally destroyed me, i can not carry on with no wifi for 2 weeks
I have had to come down the road to send this message
Help ?


We will see what response i get
I have been with BT for 37 years !
I have never known anything like it !!

No one in the world should be left with no communication!!

No warning, no contact from them, NO !!

They just sent me a brand new hub, to set up and then cut my wifi completely

And they are saying 2 weeks minimum.

What i do not understand is i have a brand new hub in place , surely its not that hard to reconnect me !!???"
Chris,Bristol,6/7/21,Can't fault the service. Was due initially to have the broadband connect 4 weeks after purchase however after the first visit in week one Open Reach could not locate the 'in' to my property and decided that some ground work would need to be done (digging up a bit of path). This pushed my go live date back by a further 4 weeks which would leave me without a connection for 4 weeks as I'd terminated my contract with Virgin. Spoke with BT who immediately dispatched a 4G router to cover the down time. Following week Open Reach dug up the path and did the necessary ground work - spoke with BT again who then brought forward my go live date to the original agreed date. Excellent service all round.
Ray,North Tyneside,6/7/21,"On moving to BT, my elderly, hard-of-hearing grandparent intended to retain our phone number, but this did not happen (whether through misunderstanding or miscommunication). We were only made aware of this months later when our original number was deprecated by our previous provider, and we contacted BT to inquire what was happening. We're now outside of the period BT would allow us to reclaim our original number.

The problem is that BT did NOT notify us of the change of phone number. Had they done so, we would have been able to promptly rectify whatever issue led to not retaining our original number, and we would have been able to reclaim our original number within the allowed time period.

The agents I've spoken to have been nothing but helpful, I cannot fault them and I understand there's nothing further they can do to help, but the failings of BT's processes have resulted in an easily avoidable issue and inconvenienced my elderly grandparent."
Anna,AL5,6/7/21,WHAT AN AWFUL AWFUL SERVICE. A BT engineer came to our house a week ago to set up the internet and left without connecting us for some line problem. He gave us no idea on when it would be resolved. Endless calls with BT to organise for another engineer to come today and they didn't show up. I thought it was an essential service what they provide????
John P,Chelmsford,6/3/21,I'm absolutely disgusted with BT. My mother whos in her 80s switched from EE to BT in what she was told would be a straightforward process taking a couple of weeks. 3 months on and she still hasn't got broadband. This is despite 7 visits from a number of incompetent workmen who in most cases did not have the skill or equiptment to complete the work the came to do. BT are still charging her and it's taking over 45mins to reach BT to complain. BTs fraudulent abuse is nothing short of criminal.
Adam parkin,Thetford,6/1/21,Poor never use them I been with them for yrs and went too fiber 2yrs ago since then been hell service dropping at least 15times a day wrong engineers sent asked for reduction in Bill cos of poor service no I was paying £49 per month so switching too Vodafone guess what they called and offered too match there price my answer was get lost I asked ages ago for reduction because Ur bad service rather give my money too someone else by the way £22pm on Vodafone with calls might get same problems but at least I am not paying over the top prices please please stay away from BT
Tim Griffiths,Cardiff,5/29/21,Don't even think about joining BT. Shocking customer service . Stay well clear
Mark,Northumberland,5/28/21,"They are the worst company i have ever had to deal with. Dont let their PR fool you, their systems seem designed to draw your custom and then take whatever they can with subversive distracting and downright dishonest practice. I am now onto my seventh account number. They even repeatedly rebuffed my request to escalate my complaint and instead advised me on what OFCOM would conclude. I am outraged and remain so since i first engaged with them in November 2020. I am patient and diligent, 20 hours of phone calls failed to resolve it."
Jenny Smith,Northampton,5/28/21,
Patricia Marchand,Chelmsford,5/27/21,"New customer, 1st 14 days brilliant but now dropping all the time, coming back when I call them which I have to do everyday.
Why are they advertising if their current systems cannot cope with current flow?
Surprisingly I was told by their customer services its my fault because I use alexa yes, so with BT one cannot use WiFi devices! Actually cannot use email, internet, ...
No services but still cashing the money.
All congested yet they still chose to float their cables in trees, wind and rain... oh dear it is still extremely slow when dry and sunny
It is so obvious ombudsmen not doing their work!"
Ryan,Northamptonshire,5/27/21,"BT has been amazing for me I got the fiber 250 package with halo 3+ I get amazing speeds and if anything goes wrong they are quite good at helping me out, I also get bt mobile discounts because of halo 3+ and having there broadband, I definitely would recommend"

Andrew Davidson,Birmingham,5/13/21,"We were due to have services installed at the property, with the only appointment window options being 8-1 or 1-6pm. Incredibly inconvenient with school dropoff/pickup, but can't be helped so we made many arrangements to accommodate. They bombarded me with emails and texts telling me to make sure I was in. And on the morning giving the name of the engineer and his mobile number. But nothing happened. No-one turned up, no-one answered my texts or calls. And then when I spent almost an hour on the phone I was told ""it might have been a resources or time issue"", and once the engineer submitted his notes that evening they would come back to me to arrange a new appointment. They did not. I then spent over an hour on the phone, through a range of departments and 4 different people, with one gem being ""we don't want to keep passing you around on hold, that would be a bit of a wind-up""... and then proceeding to put me onto some different kind of caller queue that I never came off. Utterly unbelievable - the most atrocious organisation of services I have ever experienced, with what apparently was an approach of palming me off on hold/new caller queues as they couldn't/wouldn't deal with the problem themselves (call-time targets to hit??). I am completely understanding of operators trying to do their best job. But clearly the policies and systems in place with BT customer service are dysfunctional."
Mark Orr,Bathgate,5/8/21,"Speeds were no problem but signal to my sky meant i could not watch Disney and there advive was to drill through my wall into the cupboard where there box was and put up a shelf in my living room so there box could be closer.. eh no.. even though there box is only 5 foot away from the sky box behind a plasterboard wall. Also signal to phones would drop out too, then they said too many devices must be the issue.. 1 sky box 2 phones and 1 tablet, so i changed to sky internet and all these problems are now solved and have never returned."
Claudia,London W2,5/7/21,"I had BT for many years. It used to be the best service, in the past 5 years it declined a lot, only the price didn't. The fiber managed to be worse than normal! The instability for a central London area was insane. I was also charged for something I did not own and when i tried to dispute they reported and made it default after only a couple of months in my credit report. They blackmailed me to pay even more extra fees to have my default removed and when I paid they refused to remove. BT quality is awful nowadays, overpriced and they act in bad faith so stay clear, these days there are many other amazing companies offering the same service. I'm now very happy with NowTV for Broadband owned by sky despite of not even need a TV package."
Jay,Wirral,5/4/21,Absolute joke of a company waited in for fibre installation lost a days pay! They work with open reach when they turned up didn’t provide the lads with the correct cable fit the job and seems to be a shortage of this cable... I’m cancelling my contract and claiming for lost earnings. BT get shut of open reach and sort your equipment out

John D,Paisley,5/2/21,"Unfortunately I get my phone, tv and broadband with BT , after couple of weeks no tv, failed call-backs, when I bought the package for £24.99 for 18 months, 3 months later it has risen, constant crashing, going offline, I was offered 'fast broadband' 3-10mbps its what I got offered and told by BT I cant watch TV or call anyone, same with tv I cant go online I only joined end of Jan 2021, its been painful bad experience. I also for my website upload videos to YouTube for my site, it used to take 20mins average on old supplier, BT it's up to 24 hours which means I have to sit with no tv or phone. I recently learned there was a faster broadband connection when I was told there wasn't I recently took the upgrade and today (2nd May) BT have now cancelled that upgrade ""due to technical issues"", now I'm back to square one same response 2we're offering what you bought"" . Unfortunately I have another 2 years of pain with BT before I can finally leave them, DO NOT GO TO BT*******

p.s/ Broadband speed and reliability I would give zero stars rather than 1 star I gave above"
Vincent,Stroud,4/30/21,"Only been with BT for one month and it's been the worst experience having to deal with their incompetence.

We had to settle for ADSL initially as fibre wasn't available even though the cabinet supported it due to limited capacity. We had to wait nearly 3 weeks for an OpenReach engineer because BT claimed that there wasn't a line going into the property even though the previous occupants had Fibre 2 with BT. Unsurprisingly, the engineer informed us that there was already a line going into the property.

In the interim, we were mis-sold their Halo Hub which should have got us online until the broadband was activated however the connection was unreliable due to EE's coverage in our area and consistently dropped out. We asked to cancel it but were told that we'd have to cancel the whole order and risk another 3 week wait for the OpenReach engineer. They advised to wait until the order had completed before cancelling. When we finally got online, we were told that we couldn't cancel the Halo as we were past our cool-off period even though we'd specifically asked for them to make a note when we originally requested the cancellation.

Fibre 2 is now available to us however they claim that we can only upgrade to Fibre 1, or Fibre 2 with Halo for an inflated cost because we're currently in contract even though Fibre 2 is available to new customers for a reduced cost.

We raised a complaint and were told that we'd get a call-back on 2 occasions but were never contacted. BT claims that complaints are handled by a 3rd party who are not employed by BT so they have no control of when they get in touch.

We're still no closer to receiving the service we require from BT, nor do we have any confidence that we'll ever receive it."
Jessica Moran,London,4/28/21,"I joined BT in March and to say i'm unimpressed is an understatement! we're the 27th April and they've managed to bill me nearly £100 in that time, they've INCREASED my monthly plan (something to do with government increase)I live in a 2 bedroom flat and the WIFI only works in the front bedroom!!!!! I was with Talk Talk for 8 years and never had these issues with pricing or otherwise. my advice? stay well clear of BT Broadband."
Zs Double Glazing Ltd,Ig6 3uf,4/28/21,Bad choice bt business broadband I use 1 years they promised to me £60 after starting £100 or £150 I cancel my contract with bt now 1 years cancel contract now I received letter £2400 please don't use this rubbish company you waste your money only I don't recommended!!!
Peter M,Cheshire,4/27/21,Dreadful service and installation. Avoid at all costs. Agreed a date for installation and the engineer visited and then left without doing anything. Called the engineers mobile and he did not answer. Existing broadband was turned off. Called BT to find out what was happening. 40 minute wait on telephone to speak to someone who said they would call back with an answer. They did not call back. Another 40 minute wait to speak to someone. They said that it would be another two weeks before an engineer could visit. Only resolution to get broadband connection was they would post a dongle. Will believe it when I see it. Don't use BT it is dreadful
Conway standing,Derbyshire,4/27/21,By sent three discs to help me get broadband throughout my house. It failed so by asked me to return the discs. They failed to send the return label and then reminded me That if I failed to send the back in time I would be charged I then rang BT yet again and asked him to send a return label what you would think would be a simple task a week later I am still waiting what abysmal service one gets from BT shame on you BT
Gaynor Mckeown,Rhiddlan,4/17/21,"The BT service is so unreliable. I work from home like a lot of people currently and every day the service drops off. There is constantly an engineer in the road. The option of watching a movie via Netflix is a vague memory as it stops at least 5 times per programme, my husband spends half his time checking the speed and we are yet to receive the promised refund for any poor service. We have upgraded so many times to try and get a better service and are currently on fibre halo 2 over £65 per month and have had nothing but rubbish service for the duration. BT are a joke, it obviously stands for brilliantly terrible! They are a disgrace!"
PP,Southampton,4/16/21,"Wow I have just read some of these reviews and agree with all the negative ones! Just wish I read them before we decide to switch supplier. The pattern is the same that everyone below has reported - they miss the switch date and blame Openreach (when the same socket has worked with our previous supplier for years). We’ve spoken to managers, we’ve been promised compensation (£25 is the max you’ll get). I’d advise anyone: avoid BT, plusnet and EE (all the same company). We are six days into our contract, no internet, no sign of a contractor which we have been repeatedly promised for days). I’ll be cancelling come Monday!"
Mohammed,London,4/16/21,"DONT PICK BT FOR ANYTHING

I was conned into joing BT via a black Friday deal I saw online. This was not the case and they started to charge me £45 a month instead of £30. They started charging this bogus amount once you are out of the grace period, meaning if you want to leave by the time you realise they are charging you £45 instead of £30 you will have to pay an extortionate amount in cancellation fees. They are currently charging me £316.93 to leave this con of theirs. My advice would be to stay away from BT, any offers they put are clearly lies and far from the truth. I have been forced to stay in contract with these cons. I would like to share my experience so others would not fall for the same trap"
Annmarie,London,4/15/21,"Really really bad company. Poor service and extremely poor customer service. When they make mistakes (and pretty huge ones at that), they refuse to accept responsibility. We moved our phone & internet to them on the promise of cheap broadband and phone. We asked to keep our phone number of 20 years. They agreed.

When the move took place they disconnected our phone number and gave it away. They insisted that they no longer supported landlines and that we had to have a new digital number. This is not what they promised, so we left.

Efforts to restore our number with our new provider have been thwarted at every turn by BT out of sheer spite. Their representatives accept no responsibility whatever and had the audacity to blame us for their error. When that was getting them nowhere they then blamed Openreach. Openreach have no responsibility for phone numbers at all.

Bad bad bad company. Could not care less. I wish that I could block all their phone numbers just to give them a taste of their own medicine."

Robin Fuller,MINCHINHAMPTON,4/11/21,"Current download speed is 1.8Mb, upload is 0.3Mb. Barely good enough!"
A Alao,London,4/9/21,"Terrible company. We were lured with promises of faster broadband. More reliable service. Keeping our existing phone number. ALL LIES. Service was erratic and unreliable. If we wanted internet service in all areas of our home then BT expected us to pay more.

As for our telephone line, they disconnected that without warning, gave our telephone number away and denied ever agreeing to provide a telephone service.

Doesn’t BT stand for British Telecom? Maybe it’s British Teletubbies, it was explain your childish and irresponsible behaviour."
Paddy Flanagan,Enniskillen,4/8/21,"I have been a BT customer for many years. Firstly they never informed me my broadband contract was up and secondly they would not let me sign up to one of their deals because I am a current customer. Just signed up with Vodafone £24 p/m.
ONLY stayed with BT previously because I had a BT email. Poor customer loyalty and money grabbing gits."
Tim,Camrbridge,4/7/21,"The worst ""communications"" company ever. Shop elsewhere don't even consider for one second. Not one person I have ever spoke to about BT has anything good to say."
Agata,Edinburgh,3/31/21,was waiting almost 4 months for installation.In the beginning of March phone line has been connected.Today engineer supposed to finish work but he said I can't have full fibre internet even though contract has been signed for it.Instead I have been offered to sign contract for much slower Internet for the same price.But internet would be ready after 1-2 weeks.Bt is blaming me for that because I supposed to check if I can have specific cables in my building.How could I know I have to check this?They had 4 months for telling me this.Now I have been left without internet and can't go back to my previous provider unless I will pay double.So if you think to switch to BT you may end it up without internet at all.
Donovan,KETTERING,3/31/21,"Shocking Service as usual from BT. Ordered broadband fibre in December - Installation to the street was completed but due to Covid could not install in the house - and quite right too I would say, BUT advised of an appointment at the end of March to complete the installation, text to confirm the times - but no one pitched up for the appointment. 30 min on hold to find out whats up, but I get told by the operator to hold while she checks. The call is cut off, no return call, no news. SO I call back - I need to set up a new appointment online - Okay I do so. Next appointment - guess what no one turns up, no news. What a joke - unprofessional and absolutely useless as a company."
Andy G,Burnley,3/30/21,"Had broadband with ee/orange for 10yrs+ never had an issue, at contract renewal Feb 20 advised by ee that it was switching to improved BT router .....13 months later, 12+ engineer visits last year, 9 visits this year (2 last week) broadband keeps dropping connection and running at half minimum speed guarantee on a good day...dropped connection 12 times in last hour, spoke to them again tonight, another engineer due in 2 days. Stayfast guarantee is useless, they reset it after every engineers visit so they never have to credit you....Customer Service people are good just a pity the service is so appallingly bad....internet has dropped connection twice whilst typing this review....BT...Bleeding Trouble !!"
Jim Morgan,Bath,3/30/21,"After waiting 14 days for connection, I have yet to receive a full 24 hour service from the broadband in 1 room let alone every room! it was installed on 15th march DO NOT TAKE A BT CONTRACT its a rip off."
egor,north west,3/28/21,"Very happy since switching from Virginmedia. Very flexible landline deal - I switched from a 700 free minutes on the landline to a second BT sim including 2GB data as wasn't using the landline allowance with a very efficient phone call.

Description:28/3/2021 - 0657 BEWARE OF VIRGIN MEDIA CONTRACT LOOPHOLES WHEN ENDING THEIR CONTRACT!

The fact that virgin media is exceptional in refusing to allow new providers to initate contract termination when transferring to a new landline/broadband provider is poor customer service. It is clearly just intended to grab a few more months subscription from customers who are unaware of this loophole but bound by a contract which is counter-intuitive and underhand. BT warn on their website that Virgin is pretty much unique in this - you did the same to me despite delaying porting of my landline over to BT 19/2/2021. Yet you refuse to acknowledge that this request was due to a transfer of phone and data service to a competitor and continue to bill me monthly until I called you after a wait, to spell this out with no understanding or concession from your off-shore call centre. I'm posting this feedback as widely as I can to warn other customers."
Patricia Marchand,Chelmsford,3/26/21,"I ordered fibre plus 1st February 2021. I asked for a check to make sure all will be OK, that is a quick survey, and was told by text this will happen. Installation was due on the 19th March, I received emails and texts to tell me an engineer will attend between 8am and 1pm.
The day before I called to make sure but was told there will be no need as cable does not need to be replaced. Then between 7am and 7:30 one guy was at my door from Kelly communications, he refused to install and left!
BT then decided to place an order as if I did for ordinary fibre.
Today 26th March it is very slow and carry on breaking!
I am elderly so probably they think i do not need good and reliable broadband.
Horrible company all about money, no sense of duty or morality."
Nikki blunn,Somerset,3/25/21,"Finally leaving BT after over 30 years. I’ve stuck with them and rubbish Broadband, spending Thousands in the process, in the hope it will improve or Fibre would arrive. In the past 24 hours I’ve been cut off and not phoned back, lied to that I can’t raise a complaint unless I leave and kept on hold for up to 30 minutes. Going to 4G and giving up our landline. In my opinion they should no longer be allowed to operate"
Irene Davies,Stockport,3/25/21,"Hi BT team today I felt that I had to write a review on your wonderful BT team. I have been through to 3 departments today: BT TV accounts, BT Billing, BT TV reception & each person i spoke to was understanding, helpful & patient. Sunny in Doncaster a special thanks to him he is such a nice young man. He explained
everything in full, not rushed & there was a favourable outcome. Outstanding customer service. Unfortunately I have forgotten the names of the 2 ladies who dealt with my next queries but they were equally the same.
Many thanks from me a 75+ lady keep up the good work .

Pat,London NW9,3/22/21,Absolutely shocking broadband! Useless for home workers. Avoid at all costs and choose any alternative provider!
Andrei Lazar,Bournemouth,3/21/21,"It took them 27 days to switch my adress, after they fail 3 times to do it.The internet is down every 10 minutes for couple of seconds. Impossible ti wotk from home. I wanted to cancel the contract, but they put me a tax of £268, because I don't want this poor service."
Michael,Preston,3/19/21,"Had issues from the start with BT. I was in a situation where I had to call to set up my account. They took down multiple details incorrectly. They informed me I would receive a welcome pack and over two weeks later I haven't received anything.

I eventually had to call to get access to my online account with BT. This took over an hour due to multiple issues. For example, no one was able to provide my landline phone number (which I don't use or want), the reason they said was for security purposes. I confirmed all my security questions and was still unable to get this detail until almost an hour into the call. I had to speak to 3 different people altogether and 2 were very rude while the first person I spoke to was polite. So hit and miss on the customer service.

Next comes the broadband speed check. I have had broadband for just over 2 weeks. I pay for 74MB/s fibre. Every test I did came in between 20MB/s and 52MB/s download speed. I reset my router and tried again multiple times. I then, after getting access to my account online ran a BT speed test (a few of them), it always came in at 74MB/s. So what I have now come to the conclusion is a fake test as even a wired connection to the router never got above 52MB/s.

The biggest joke is the actual broadband products they provide. They only guarantee a speed at less than half of what you pay for. In my opinion, this 74MB/s package should therefore be advertised as a 34MB/s package. With fibre, you would expect a consistent faster speed than a standard package. Unfortunately, I am stuck with BT for now, previously I was with Virgin at 100MB/s with no real issues for over 8 years (speed tests were much more consistent, sometimes exceeding what I was paying for). As soon as Virgin becomes available in my area I will be changing suppliers back to Virgin.

Overall, bad router, bad broadband package, wrong advertising on their products, hit and miss with customer service, bad website, fake BT speed test. Broadband hasn't cut out hence the 2 stars on reliablity but it is slowly getting worse before having to reset the router each time."
Jordan,London,3/10/21,"BT have consistently failed to deliver acceptable standards of customer service.
1. Competitive contract prices. Had to negotiate new contract prices down to new customer levels over the course of 1 hour. They then included at their own decision anti-virus software at the cost of £8 per month. This had to be removed at my request. It was not mentioned that it was included as an add on. A complaint was raised.
2. Cancelled my contract on the incorrect date. When moving home I informed BT I was leaving my current property and when the contract should end. They cancelled it on an incorrect date leaving me without home broadband for 2.5 weeks. Offering a 4g mini hub as an apology which has been poor. Several complaints were raised.
3. Attempting to charge for a homehub. When leaving BT, BT will provide a package so that you can return the homehub to them or face a fee of £43. This was not received before the move and BT have attempted to charge for this. A complaint was raised.

I would never use BT again. I would never recommend BT to friends or family and would in fact actively discourage people from using their services."
Kevin,Cheshire,3/7/21,"I've been with BT for over 5 years now, and to be honest, I've had absolutely no issues at all. I'm in a new build property, so that probably helps - all the phone line plumbing etc is new. So I can't really comment on customer service as I've had zero reason to get in touch with them, other than to upgrade from standard ADSL to Infinity 2 a few years ago. The standard BT hubs are not, in my opinion, particularly great, so I ditched mine ages ago and use a good quality unit purchased separately. I have found speed to be consistently good - better than advertised. The only issue is price - it has crept up somewhat during my contract, so I've knocked customer service down to 4 stars as I don't like the practice of hiking prices for existing customers, although BT aren't the only offenders here. Overall, good reliable service but not especially competitive on price, so I'm looking around for alternatives now.."
Jackie,Wales,3/7/21,"Doesn’t even deserve one star!!!
Doesn’t even deserve one star! So I signed up for BT on the 6th of January didn’t hear anything from Bt after so I had to get back in touch and order again on the 25th of January. My hub arrived pretty quickly to be fair but this was literally the only quick and efficient part. Opened the box and half of the connections were missing, there was no adsl filter or grey connection cable. So I waited for a couple of days and still herd nothing from BT so I made a call to find out when I would be connected. They told me I would go live on the 5th of February, this date came and went so I had to contact BT again, they then said I would be live on the 12th of feb, which was fine. The 12th came and still no connection, so of course I called BT again, they told me they needed to get an engineer out and that one would come on the 15th, yes you know what’s coming next, still no broadband or engineer.
I had to make yet another call to Bt to then be told that an engineer would be out to get the connection up and running etc on the 4th of March and I would be live between the 4th-6th, yet again still no connection so I had to make another phone call yet again today! To my frustration I was told the same bull and that they would speak to the connections team so I was told she would one be a few short moments.....55mins I was on hold for to then be cut off. So yes at this point I’m done, someone was good enough to call me back and apologise for the loss of connection and said they just needed to go through some security questions with me before he could look into it, I stopped him at this point and told him to cancel my order, he said again he was sorry on behalf of Bt and will get this sorted rite away, I said cancel my order and have gone with a different provider now, sky promise I will be live on the 16th of March. Music to my ears, my children mite finally be able to connect to the internet and do their schoolwork log onto google classroom and try and somewhat catch up with the work they have not been able to do thanks to BT.

I know I have gone on a little but I am so frustrated and angry with the customer service and the whole service of Bt infact, to keep getting told and promised that we would be connected after two months is a bloody joke, and yes I know circumstances are difficult for us all at the moment because of Covid so why keep moving the goalpost and postponing connection for me and lie everytime I called. Appalling!

I will never ever go with Bt again after this experience, I will avoid at ALL costs, certainly will not be recommending BT to anyone ever.

Also when you call customer services expect to be on the phone for atleast two hours, you will spend around 110mins listening to music on hold while they go and make a cup of tea and eat cake, to pop on the phone for about a min to tell you it will be connected at such and such a date then hang up, and guess what......you don’t get connected.

Very unhappy customer and angry"
Darren Beresford,Forest Hill,2/26/21,"DO NOT GO WITH BT
FASTER MEANS NOTHING IF IT NEVER WORKS.

16 months ago i made the mistake of paying a premium for BT direct to premises fibre.
After disconnecting my previous provider, i was then told by the engineer that they could then not connect me to the BT fibre as there wasn't any on my street, despite being sold that package.

I was finally connected six weeks later, during which time i had no internet.

Since then, my fibre has been cut, literally, four times by Openreach engineers each time they connect another house on my street.

Apparently, my fibre is at the top of the box and every time somebody new on the street gets fibre, mine gets broken when they open the box. Why this is the case is beyond me or any of the engineers who have been out to ""fix"" it. The problem is still occurring.

My fibre went out yet again yesterday, (for the third time during lock down, whilst I'm trying to home school three kids and work from home) so i went down to the exchange where i knew i would find an engineer, who told me that through he'd broken it, he couldn't fix it. So far, both the engineer that broke it and the one that came out to fix it, have failed to fix it.

The dongle that i have previously been sent does not work in my house as i get no signal.

Having spent three hours on the phone to 12 different people at BT over the last two days, i have been told that they won't activate my copper line temporarily whilst they fix the fibre (usually takes at least two weeks). I just have to do without internet whilst working from home and home schooling.

I pay over £50 a month for this privilege.

I genuinely wish i'd just stayed on regular broadband.

I'm not going to call again. I give up. You win."
Annmarie Alao,London,2/23/21,"We had a really bad experience. We swapped to BT as our previous provider was slow and erratic. Imagine our surprise when we found that BT was the same.

Worse still, we had asked to keep our phone number and had been promised that this would be done. On the day our broadband was switched BT disconnected our phone line as “we had not requested one”.

Who, in this day and age, lives without a main home phone. Not only that but we have lost the phone number we have held for over 35 years. No one wants to help us get it back.

So angry!"
Ian,Hambleton,2/22/21,"No grounds for complaint at all. Fibre speeds are good (and consistent), reliability is excellent, and the BT Smart Hub is great.. Providing that you negotiate seriously at renewal time, the price stays competitive and removes any need to switch."
Tim Taylor,Kelso,2/16/21,"Pitiful, never had more than 8Mb broadband on a good day, now down to 1.04Mb download and 0.05Mb upload speed."
James,Cirencester,2/12/21,"Incredibly angry about BT's service. Switched from Sky because of promise of fire optic which after 2 weeks was told wasn't available. Then a long string of problems. No managers ringing back when promised. Then even the standard copper broadband order didn't go through because of a problem. Endless problems and terrible customer service.

Don't waste your time with BT, go to sky or whoever else."

Kai,Edinburgh,2/8/21,"When I signed my BT landline plus broadband contract, I was informed it is going to be a 12-month contract. One month before the contract ends, I phoned customer service to give the 30 days notice. I was told that my contract has magically extended. I have to pay £140++ worth of cancellation fee. This is all be cause BT sneakily advertised the landline service to be mis-matched with the broadband, so that we customers will be tricked to pay for the broadband for 18 months. I am a student who are financially affected by the pandemics. I demand my service to be cancelled free of charge."
pat,Allington Maidstone,2/7/21,
Varinder Rehal,Leeds,2/6/21,"Moving over from Sky fibre broadband to BT FULL FIBRE BROADBAND would be easy I thought, as I was promised minimal disruption. Instead, BT have left me with no internet connection and no phone line for almost a week (and still counting). My wife and I can’t work from home (I am vulnerable), kids can’t be homeschooled, parents can’t call us. Add to that we can’t access our Netflix or Amazon accounts. This is most likely the WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE of my life. I have had to buy a mobile Wi-fi dongle and data card at nearly £100 to give me something in the interim. Gave one stars only because the system didn’t allow me to leave zero. Can I go back to Sky...?"
karl smith,ross on wye,2/5/21,we changed from postoffice to BT and the difference is amazing love the design of the BT router within an hour our internet was transformed fast clear phone line 10/10 thankyou BT recommended people

Awful customer service, lie after lie to get me off the phone and no clarification on when we'll be connected. Decided to look elsewhere and cancel our subscription immediately"
Terry W,Torquay,2/2/21,"I've been a BT customer since I moved from Sky 8 years ago. Moved the service to the new house 2.5 years ago with some problems with the new set up. Since then I have 74mb up and 18 ddown 24 hurs a day EVERY day. I am now moving to the FTTP 300 mb option and have had the xternal work done (cable from the cabinet 30 yards away) and I'm now waiting for the internal connection, delayed due to the epidemic. I have always found the broadband rock steady and at the speed advertised. I do not use the BT router/wireless hardware as it is far too restricting in how you can set it up (30 years in the IT) industry. No company is perfect but I am a happy bunny with them and would not change suppliers."
Ola,London SW9,1/23/21,"business broadband is absolute crap. There has been no full week of optimal performance, either constant dropped connections or just download speed below an acceptable level.
BT is absolute crap for the level of national infrastructure they have unfettered access to.

I will not recommend the business plan to anyone nor the regular plan as I've used both.

Customer service is good as there the poor guys always try to help but from a LEAN perspective, organizations that invest so much in customer service to deal with errors have done a very bad job in giving a good service."
Robin Boden,Brownhills,1/22/21,BT is the worst provider i have been with. Sky was more reliable and they use they BT line.... go figure??!!. Customer service is the only positive they have in my thoughts. As soon as virgin media is in the street I will be changing provider. I would not recommend BT services.
Brian Deehan,East Yorkshire,1/22/21,"I despair at BT nowadays. For the past 2 months, over 20 phone calls to them and several hours on the phone I still have 2 landlines. Is it too much to ask just to transfer the broadband to the other line and then close the first line? Every BT advisor has a different opinion of how to do this. Their complaints procedure is not fit for purpose and they never call me back. Usually half an hour wait to talk to them then constantly transferred. Its time the Government looked at their infrastructure monopoly in the countryside."
Chris VW,Guildford,1/11/21,"Dreadful speeds for most of the day, never more than 10mps, and drops right off at 5pm to less than 2mps despite paying for a minimum 16mps. Complaint lodged with them."

Chloe Duignan,Northamptonshire,12/27/20,"After recently joining BT I was not best pleased with some of the service we got and nothing was getting actioned. However I luckily got a lovely lady called Jinder Kaur from the Leicester office (I think) who promptly resolved the issue and promised to call back which she did and also followed up after Christmas to make sure I received my connectors and got the engineer booked in.
If only all customer service stay was like her in every company!! These 5 stars go directly to her and I really hope this review will be passed on to her.
Thank you Jinder!!

Customer service is awful and they will use a variety of tactics to prevent you from leaving them, including just charging you after you phoned about 8 times to cancel.
Waste of money, bad service, bad customer service, would not recommend."
dave,cumbria,12/25/20,"slow, unreliable , expensive, difficult people to deal with"
Robin Boden,Brownhills,12/21/20,"I've had BT now for nearly 6 months, in this time I'm now on my second hub.i cannot get wireless at the rear of the house and my pc is 6ft away and cant connect to the hub ffs. I had better connection with sky who use BTs lines.... go figure. I cant wait for Virgin to come into the street."
Daniel,Edinburgh,12/15/20,"Broadband ordered at EE/BT shop; EE agent signing me up to BT contract ordered wrong installation. He also got my email address wrong and failed to correct it when I pointed this out.
After much to-ing & fro-ing, the wrong installation was corrected but BT classed that as a new contract (not a correction)and charged me a higher price ! BT refunded the difference only after high level complaint, but refused to correct the erroneous contract price.
After 3 unscheduled calls to me when I was out, BT's CEO staff's first reply to my complaint was an email saying they'd closed my complaint, with no explanation. I had to arrange a scheduled call to find out what action had been taken. They said the 'closed complaint' unexplanatory email was standard policy, and they (CEO staff !) had no power to change it, nor could say who set up that policy. Also said they were the highest complaint level, the CEO & senior staff were above my reach (how convenient for them !)"
Lorraine,Newtownabbey,12/14/20,"Stay clear ,cant wait till out of contract.Internet intermittent constantly o access to subscribed channels but still have to pay for a service I'm not getting.
2 separate engineers have visited 10 minutes after first engineer visit broadband starts dropping second engineer wanted to put a cable across my room told me to cover it with a rug,yes sure really safe with young child and toddler.Made a complaint and got told we will change your package till fibro broadband and that will fix things ,but we cant install it for a nearly a month ,"
Alexandru Seremet,Epsom,12/10/20,"""Sorry, nothing we can do"" should be BT's motto
The worse experience with anything ever. It started at the end of September when I placed an order for their full fiber 100 and TV package. It was more expensive than the competition but because it was a line take over they told me it should take only 20 days to get it set up as opposed to other companies that told me it would take a month or more. 20th of October was the initial activation date and the only thing that goes live is the landline (super useful in 2020) and nothing else. Apparently there was a need for additional work before they could get the broadband installed so I was pushed back to the 29th.

On the 29th an engineer came and told me he could not install the fiber broadband because there is no fiber run to this building. Apparently Open Reach has also messed up their site and had the wrong details about what kind of broadband can be installed at my address. This is the beginning of the downward spiral.

After that BT doesn't know how to deal with the problem. They put me on a temporary copper connection straight out of 1995 with less than 1Mbps speed on average and tell me it might take up to 26 weeks to fix the problem. At least the TV line was activated so good job there I guess.

Luckily, it only take a couple of weeks for Open Reach to fix their mess but when I thought it was finally over it turns out that the original fiber broadband I have order is no longer available, in fact there is no more FTTP plan available, only FTTC. As confused as I was I said ""fine get me that one and let's be done with this"".

Another small problem, because the initial order has gone through it has glitched the system and no one can cancel the order now in order to place a new one.

Now this is the peak of autism for BT. When I call to ask for a solution someone tells me that it might be faster to make a new account in my name (the original was in my father's name) and take over the line. What he failed to mention is the penalties that will be incurred for doing so. I call them and ask them about that and they told me ""it's all very unfortunate and we are very sorry but there is nothing that we can do"". I was directed to the billing department to dispute it and will update this review with the results.

So, after all that, more that 2 month of delay you would think that I finally got my services activated. Wrong! 9th of December was the new activation date and that day comes and again nothing. I called today (10th of December) and they told that they will get back to me, Almost every time they told me that nothing happened and I had to call them back.

At his point I don't know what to say anymore. I have been treated like a door mat for BT to wipe their feet on and then I was asked to pay for that privilege. To be fair, their customer services was friendly but next to useless so what's the point?

0/10 would absolutely not recommend, even urge you to steer clear if at all possibl"
Felman,Moston manchester,12/10/20,Poor broadband internet supplier it keeps cutting off and buffering
tony,ashford,12/9/20,"Terrible service, fault with broadband and have to wait couple of weeks before they can look at the fault, been told that they don't have to fix the fault within the first 30 days. Would be quicker for me to change broadband suppliers but BT will charge me £200 plus to leave before contract ends."
Mark Turner,Oxted,12/8/20,My Broadband has been down for 12 days now with no resolve. I have contacted support constantly and even had Open Reach say they visited me (lie) and I would repair it myself!!! So I was put back in urgency list. Aaaagghhh!!
Emil,Gabriele,12/8/20,What an absolute shambles BT and kelly communications are i orderd fast fiber in mid september and kellys who were supposed to install the wire didnt bother so that was a major delay BT staff not botherd and kept blaming everyone else its now the begining of december and im still waiting to be connected steer well clear of Bt and its associates shocking display on how to run a company and would not reccomend them to anyone even my worst enemy
Richard lee,East Barkwith,12/5/20,"Just read some reviews and realised that the worst service I’ve ever experienced is normal for BT, how can this company be so poor at delivering what they promise / organise, I’m going to email the CEO to see if they are interested or aware of how poor the BT company has become"

Good Luck to anyone ever dealing with BT - DREADFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Vanessa,Cornwall,11/28/20,"I would not recommend BT to anyone. What should have been a simple and easy case of transferring my existing account and service to my new address when I moved house has been an absolute nightmare. They cancelled part of my order on my moving day took over two weeks to put the new order through (leaving me without a working landline or internet service for a number of days), billed me for an increased tarrif at my old address account after I'd moved out, assured me that they wouldn't debit my account for this incorrect bill but did anyway, they've also set my new account up on a higher tarrif then originally agreed, and have ignored my last six emails to the Home Moves Team trying to get this all resolved (who'd promised me a call back two weeks ago, but who still haven't called me). I've also spent hours repeatedly on hold also trying to get through to someone to get it sorted (I'm currently on the phone to BT in a queue and have already been on hold for over an hour this morning). I've lodged complaints which have not been dealt with, and this is still dragging on six weeks after first advising them of my house move. Absolutely unacceptable way to treat their customers! I'll be raising this with the Ombudsman if BT don't get it all sorted out soon. If you're thinking of moving to BT I'd advise you to avoid at all costs, I'd really wished that I'd just switched to a new service provider when I moved house!"
john bags,Berks,11/26/20,"Router is excellent. Full speeds on wifi upstairs. I pay fot 50Meg and usually get 42Meg. No down time at all in last 18 months. Free Anti-virus plus other perks etc. Pricey, but you get what you pay for."
Nicole,London,11/25/20,"Horrible service ! Have paid for my contract with them, a month has passed and they still haven’t implemented the equipment and the wifi in my place. Have had 5 arranged appointments with them, and every time the engineer did not show up and did not even inform ! Completely unacceptable, horrible service and reliability ! Every time you try and contact them you have to wait for one hour, and every time someone says they will fix it and then the appointment does not got through ! Also, they promise to call you back, but eventually no once calls you, so you have to call them again and wait for one hour until someone replies."
Jean,Wakefield,11/17/20,
Jim,Attleborough,11/15/20,"After years of sub 5 Mbs speed, and waiting to be connected to fibre (about 300 yards from the house), we installed 4G broadband. We now get 30-35Mbs download, and about 10-15Mbs upload. This may be pretty pathetic for city dwellers but if you live in the countryside you will appreciate that these numbers are high. So if you live in the middle nowhere, like us, it might be worth trying a 4G service. We needed an aerial on the outside of the house, but BT installed that for free, a rare example of good customer service. We pay £50 monthly and are capped at 500GB monthly, but again, having tolerated miserably bad speeds for years we're quite happy at the moment"
Nick T,London,11/14/20,"Worst service I have ever experienced. New installation, they ddnt turn up 2 times to the appointment. Finally intalled was working ok for a month and then they canelled it! A new order had to be made and start all over again, have been without service for more than a week now and no end in sight. Pathetic. Avoid"
Paula,Wrexham1,11/10/20,"Been without network connection for nearly 4 weeks now. Firstly i was told that it was an external problem and would be sorted within 5 days. I then had a text to say the problem had been sorted..... it had'nt. Another hour long call and they arranged a house visit and i had to wait another 5 days. I booked a day off work. At 2.30 i had an email to say i needed to book an engineer to fix my problem. I telephoned bt again an they said
(this is where the lies start) an engineer had been and there was nobody at the premises. The engineer then phoned my mobile and i cancelled. I asked the advisor if he could confirm the number the engineer rang and the number i was given did not belong to me, or anyone in my household.Another appointment was made for the following day, guess what! Yes it was cancelled again, through an email telling me again that i needed to book an engineer. Another hour long call to bt, this time they could'nt give me a reason as to why they had cancelled. I told them i wish to terminate my contract with them and they told me i had 12 months left and would have to pay the outstanding amount(£460) The first oppertunity i get to leave this supplier i will. They said openreach was the problem and they they do all the broadband regardless of my supplier. I said that bt are the company i pay and it's up to them to provide the service i pay a lot for."
RoyB,Bucks,11/5/20,"Most days at some point ,I get the message ""your computer is not connected . "" I have .breeze block walls. The signal only had to travel 3 to 5 metres ."
D,London,11/5/20,"Our experience with BT is absolutely horrible. We signed up with them only because they were the only provider offering over 100mb speed at our current address. They booked us an engineer visit on two occasions which they've missed (both), then 3rd time lucky, but leaving us without internet for 5 weeks. Now we are moving home and they can only offer us 30mb to 60mb at the new address. They wanted us to sign a fresh new contract on 30mb for a further 24months. Of course, we want out of our contract since they cannot honor their part of the deal & Virigin can offer us up to 500mb. They are not allowing us to leave without a buyout fee which is ridiculous. Since they want us to go on a fresh contract, it only shows that the old one does not stand. Absolutely horrible."
Jacques,"Burton , Christchurch",11/4/20,"Internet down for 2 weeks now. From first day promised will come back in 24 hrs - never did . Both my wife and I opened complaints and got ""assigned case owner ""- never heard back ( not even an email nor phone call ) - and now my complaint marked off as completed and resolved without any feedback or progress . Openreach staff told me outside on main road it was their fault as they mixed cables - transferring greenboxes on the first day of internet loss . I wish I could mark no stars on this - but Trustpilot only allows me to mark lowest 1 star - absolute appalling ( both of us rely on the internet at home for income - during covid . If my phone signal was good enough in area or if I had an alternative option - I would have swapped already ."
Jesper Johansson,Dalston,11/2/20,"An absolute joke of a company in terms of service and looking after your new customers. We were due internet on Friday and one and a half weeks later we're still speaking to support to even get an engineer sent out. The initial engineer wasn't able to complete work outside the flat due to requiring a hoist to get up the pole, however he just left and never told us even though we were just across the road.

Had to phone back, get another engineer booked for Wednesday, never showed up. Had to book a new one for Friday, now there was an error in their booking system and so never showed up.

Booked again for the following Monday, and yet again the same system error meant that no engineer showed up on the day (we only find this out after each of the no-shows and not in advance)

Now we've been told that the 'error' is meant to be fixed by Tuesday and only then can we book an engineer again which will likely be at least another few days to a week.

All in all we set up to become a customer over a month ago to be live 2 weeks ago, seems that planning ahead means absolutely nothing. The empty promises and poor service is endless, and at this point any trust in the company is completely gone."
sarah,milton keynes,10/29/20,"I wanted to post this as a complaint on their site but before I had finished posting it, it was already closed. Showing they clearly care about your feedback. I can't be bothered to change this text so that's it's not directly addressing them but I want to post this to get this off my chest. So keep that in mind.
My situation was this, I am currently using BT in my apartment and have been doing so for a year and a half. Recently, I bought a new house and the keys to the house would be handed to me on the 19th October. In anticipation for this day, I went to the BT website on the 6th of October and had ordered for new broadband to be set up for the 22nd in this new house. On the 13th, the week before, I received an email saying that this order had been cancelled. Confused, I called in to BT to try and understand the situation. I explained my circumstance to the person on the phone and asked him what could have been the reason for the cancellation, and he said he did not know. I then asked him if it was possible that the people who were currently staying in the house who were about to move out, were the ones who cancelled it and he said it was possible. Okay I said, I could see how if the previous tenants got a call saying that their internet was going to be changed (granted that it was going to be taken over on a date where they would not be in the house) then I could see how a mix up could occur. I asked the man on the phone if it would be possible to make the order again and which time it would be best to do so. He said that it would be alright to make the order right away if I knew I was definitely going to be at the house by the 19th. I said I was sure I would be in the house by then, but I wanted him to be sure that I could make this order and this would not happen again. He assured me that it would be fine. We make the order again and I can see that it was made for the 27th of October. This is a lot far down than I would like it to be but I thought it was fine if this is the best time they could do and I know things are stressful at the moment so I don’t want to push anything.
A week passes and the weekend before the 27th comes around and I receive no notice of BT making their order which I thought was odd as I thought BT would always give me small reminders that they were coming. Especially when you compare it to all the process of all furniture shops and gadget shops that I’ve been seeking patronage from for this new house as this is the standard process for all of them.
The 26th comes around and the delivery of my equipment has not been made yet. I track my order online and above it says that my order is cancelled but below it looks as if my order is still on track for my house. Confused, I call into the BT help desk to ask them what the true status of my order is. The guy checks my order and says he noticed the cancellation that was made before but that this current order is still on track but there were just some delays. He said that it should really arrive the next day or the day after. I feel relieved as he has reassured me that the order was still on track and happy that I could finally set up my internet so that I could move in and get my house together while working from home.
The next day comes and nothing arrives, and no email or text message arrives telling me they are still making the delivery. I decide to call in again to reconfirm that the order is definitely on its way only to be told that this new order was actually cancelled by the previous people again and it was done on the 15th. Now I am seriously confused and frustrated and extremely disappointed. I tell the assistant I had not received any message indicating that this had happened and that someone had told me yesterday that the order was on its way. She apologizes profusely and says there’s nothing she can do except make the order for me again and that it should come on the 10th of November. I ask her if there is any way she can move it up and she says no. I feel really dejected at this point so the lady encourages me to call in until someone makes a cancellation and I can take their spot. I felt a bit better after hearing this and decided that I would try.
Now today comes which is the 28th of October, and I decide to call in to first check the status of my order to confirm it is definitely on its’ way and to see if there were any cancellations. The man that answered assured me that the order is on its way but told me there was no way for me to take the spot of cancellations and move up my date. I told him this was not what was told to me the day before and he tells me that the lady must have been wrong. Again, I feel dejected again and he apologizes by giving my £10 credit for my phone (which I won’t use) and that he will lodge a complaint for me but frankly, both things don’t make me feel better about the situation.

Now I completely acknowledge my fault in trying to order the internet before I had fully moved into my new house. I should not have assumed that because I had paid for the house, had a date set for when we would exchange keys and know that the tenants were definitely moving out that the process would have been smooth and without hiccups. However, I wish to address the parts that were lacking on the BT side and were improvement could be added.
1. Communication – the first problem stems from the fact that I did not receive an email or text message or a phone call or anything letting me know of the second cancellation. Had I been allowed to know immediately after, I would have waited for the 19th to come, knowing we had full rights to the house (so there should be no reason for a new cancellation), and made a new order where it wouldn’t take so much time for my internet to be installed.
2. Staff collectively and consistently knowing the process – As I stated above, I talked to several people within BT in order to sort this out and I was given very different information from all of them. If it was a situation where I stayed quiet and just accepted everything at face value, then I wouldn’t make such a fuss for this point. But that was not the case, I constantly asked questions in order to reassure or reconfirm my suspicions. I asked the first guy if it were possible that the order could be cancelled again, and he said it would not. I asked the second guy if the order was still on track and he said that it was. I asked the third lady if I could call back and move up my installation date, if there was a cancellation and she said that I could, only to be told by the 4th guy that I can’t. What is going to happen if I call the 5th time? What is going to be contradicted now? This is the genuine paranoia that I have been left with and it will not fade until I am sure there is internet in my house. I understand staff having flexibility to appease their customers but knowing what limits can and cannot be set should be understood by all in order to not create any confusion.
3. Lastly, making the process faster – I am not going to lie, this point comes from a more selfish request, but I still want to be able to voice it. I understand that fulfilling orders can be hard especially in a time where we are in lockdown and we are supposed to be appeasing to social distancing rules but I find it so frustrating when I have ordered something and it is consistently pushed back more and more and more. I made this order early because I wanted to make sure everything could be organised. If there is internet not only could I start living in the new house and effectively put furniture together, but I could start working properly from home for the new job that I just acquired. I would not have to spend money on bus tickets or expensive taxis so that I can be there in time for furniture orders just to go back through the same method to my apartment for work. I would not have to spend exorbitant amounts of energy going from my apartment to my house and back again just to sort things out. I wanted to sort out my apartment so that it could be left in good condition and I could get my full deposit back. I most importantly I wanted my house to be sorted out before my family came for the holidays.
Overall, I think that BT internet has been exceptionally good however you have issues when it comes to first delivering that service to people. I have lived in different places for work and education and this issue with delivery is not the first time I’ve experienced this. There was even a time where I ordered for your broadband service and it did not start working until after about 2 months and a half and this was mainly due to the fact the house was not suited for the broadband that I wanted, so someone had to come in and physically install it. Waiting at this point was not an issue because I had access to the BT public Wi-Fi, so I was able to do the things I needed to do and the situation wasn’t so dire. However, at this new house the signal is so bad that I cannot connect to anything and therefore I can’t do anything. This issue where the house is not suited for the broadband that I want, could happen again but I would not know until I try to get the internet started and that would lead to more waiting which again will just make me more frustrated. I am not expecting any improvements on my situation to be made I just wanted to voice my frustrations in the hope that in the future, me or anyone else do not have to go through this."
Not Happy,Amesbury,10/26/20,"Broadband keeps cutting out. Had more serious outages in 3 months with BT than 10 years with Virgin. BT can only book engineers a week ahead, and even then they aren't guaranteed to show up. Even when they did turn up they sent someone to fix the phone rather than the broadband.

Avoid at all costs, really poor service."

Terry,Lincoln,10/25/20,Would not recommend this provider - their constant aim is to keep you as a customer - far too many scam callers on my BT land-line when i have NEVER disclosed my land-line number to anyone EVER
michail,,10/24/20,"Terrible on all levels. Had a multiple problem with the service. Unprofessional customer support, after making multiple complains about the broadband I had to book a technician who never showed up. Definitely the worst internet provider I ever had. Would not recommend to my worst enemy"
C. Kenneally,London,10/24/20,"Hindsight, they say is a wonderful thing. Had I read the reviews before deciding to try BT I would never have agreed to a contract. At the moment I am two weeks without internet. Thanks to a neighbour I'm using their internet. If possible I would give zero stars to all of the above. I spent over an hour on the phone trying to speak to someone on Wednesday and when I did get through I was told I would be getting a call back on Sunday, that's tomorrow for an update. When I contacted them over two weeks ago about an engineer calling to investigate the problem I was sent a confirmation email from BT but two minutes later a second email was sent telling me that there was a delay so they couldn't give me a time when it would be addressed. I won't say fixed because I can't see that happening. I may just have to cut my losses and ask for a disconnection. I'll probably pay through the nose for it but at least I can try another broadband company. Maybe someone more reliable. I see positive review here but to be honest I think they must be from BT staff either that or someone who is being paid to write imaginary reviews"
Tris,Scotland,10/13/20,"Terrible customer service up to 40 minutes on the phone to get through. Complaints do nothing and got charged for a month that my Internet didn't work.

Will not use again!!"
Edd,North east,10/10/20,I was having problems trying to switch over to BT from virgin (virgin is excellent but a little pricey) Tried to contact customer service and had nothing but hassle. It felt like they were not bothered about me switching to them. It got to the point where I was so frustrated with them that I put the phone down and I will now stick with virgin and not be using BT. They are not worth the hassle.
Bob Costelus Raimondo,CRAYFORD,10/9/20,"0 is the correct sattisfaction and reliability. I chose BT because of the brand....big mistake. I did the same with Virgin, bouth rubbish network providers in my area. I have 3 childreen and i use internet quite often, even with my CCTV, and dorbell with camera. The internet it is realy not working att all, i have the round hubb what they bragg about but it is only for disighn....not pleased at all and i canceled the contract. I have 40Mb minimum and 18 MB upload in contract but the speed is much less,nothing is not working, fault after fault, youtube is not loading, they talk to talk but dont chose BT...contract for 40£ a month and no good internet?????? What a joke,!!!"
Kevin McGowan,Ilkley,10/7/20,Drops in speed all the time. Zoom calls cut off regularly. In these times of home working we need a more reliable service. When my contract tie in ended they quickly bumped me up to £40 month even though the same package for new subscribers is £26. We are living in tough economic times but BT will still happily rip you off.
DARREN,MITCHELL,10/1/20,
Peter,Cambourne,9/17/20,"If you're thinking about switching to BT broadband because of the BT reward card incentive then beware. They seem to be making it difficult to claim this, despite them claiming it should appear automatically on your account.

My own experience was that the reward card never appeared on my account. After contacting live chat to enquire about this, the adviser said he could not transfer me to the relevant department and told me to phone instead. This would have involved wasting more of my time because of the long waiting time on the helpline.

A quick Google search of 'bt reward card', and filtering by the past month shows lots of people complaining about not receiving reward cards, showing this is a current widespread issue. So unless you're prepared to waste time chasing this up, then don't expect to get the card.

The broadband itself has been excellent. I'm on a FTTP connection which is fast and reliable. It's just a shame that this experience with the reward card has soured my opinion."
James,Sevenoaks,9/14/20,"I get 73 Mbps download and 18 upload on BT Fibre 2 package. I am lucky being just 120m from the fibre junction box so the copper wire last leg is relatively short. When things go wrong (about once a year - usually the service suddenly slowing down or needing frequent modem reboots) BT support has always been very fast and efficient. If they cannot fix the line remotely, an engineer has always arrived within a couple of days and the latest modem sent by post - all at no extra charge. You don’t often hear this... but I think the BT service is excellent."
elaine,west yorkshire,9/10/20,"well well BT i have to constantly contact them. their advert says 1 disc runs the house or 100 pound back. i have 3 discs and they dont work(all this in 2 months )everytime i contact im in chat for over 4 hours they go round in circles and help with nothing
they pass me on to several people including managers (i dont think ) they avoid paying the 100 at all costs like their life depends on it so FALSE ADVERTISING im tired beyond words of this company and no offence to anybody but why cant i talk to a english person why do i have to be talking to people in INDIA when at the end of the day theyre called BRITISH TELECOM, tired of it all wish id never joined ive dealt with bad companies but these are the worst DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES JOIN BT (british telecom or should i call them IT (india telecom as sinse joining theyre all ive had contact with WHY?WHY?? why cant i cantact people in england surely it would work better"
Williams,Watford,8/31/20,"I thought paying top whack prices would equal top whack service,reliability etc - it doesn't - looking at the reviews you are just as likely to experience slow speed patronising unapologetic customer service providers as you are paying half the price of BT - I am swopping to a cheaper provider for what I imagine will be the same poor experience but at least I won't be paying 50 quid a month for it"
will,London,8/30/20,"Such a terrible provider, download speed always fall short of the stated speed (e.g the stated speed was 11-13mb, and I am constantly receiving speed less than 5mb) and the pings are always spiking (varies from 30 to 500). The worst is that the slow wifi plan is even more expensive than some of the optical fibre plan provided by other competitors, I had no other choices as there is no optical fibre in my area. If you have other option BT should be avoided at all cost, extremely terrible."
Andres,London,8/30/20,"Have recently moved home and simply wanted to move the service across, but this seems to have been an unnecessarily difficult process for BT. Have had multiple orders cancelled for no reason over they last three weeks, which they cannot seem to stop doing. They say they will call back to sort out, but never do, resulting in me having to call them back. Previously the broadband had a tendency to cut out at least twice a day. It takes a good while to get through to any customer service reps, and even when you do, whilst they are pleasant enough they can rarely solve your issues there and then. Don't even think about asking for discounts for inconvenience, because they won't even consider it. Have been a loyal customer for a good while, but enough is enough and it's time to move on."
Mandy Kloppers,Surrey,8/29/20,Awful awful awful. Two weeks with no internet. Engineer supposedly came - no change. New modem sent. No change. Back at square one after two weeks and now have to wait yet another week for another engineer. Been told I cannot cancel contract unless BT fail to provide a service for 90 days!!! How can that be fair? They can fail to provide internet for three months yet I must still pay. Disgusting. Can't wait to leave...
Sam,Bath,8/28/20,
James,York,8/26/20,BT is good . Fast and good internet to my house ! Everything about it is good 100% would recommend to anyone
D smith,Manchestrt,8/24/20,Router broke asked for a new one was told they need to send engineer i was like but its the router they where like muh engineer so engineer comes out and says its your router heres an £85 charge robbing scammers
Fedra,Bath,8/20/20,"The worst company by far. Slow WiFi, slow internet, poor customer service. With our plan was included a free TV which never arrived!! When we complained they told us they couldn't do anything!!! And for last but not least we paid BT Sport and it doesn't even include payperview. What can I say? Don't sign with this company, it's a scam, big, big scam."
Groff,UK,8/18/20,
John Ellis,"whitford,Holywell",8/17/20,"Bt came to transfer our broadband from plusnet, but managed to mess it up and we have now been left with no broadband and no phone for the last fortnight with another fortnight until they will come out again. Where we live we get little if any mobile connection and rely on the broadband for work. Although after an hour trying to rebook a new visit they have behaved very badly making us wait for a month for something they did."
Johnnie Petroni,London EC1,8/12/20,"Our Fibre Optic box shared with other occupiers of our small building in London EC1 was isolated as the probable fault as to why only our office and no one else in the building had no internet. Monday we made contact. It was almost certainly a switch that needed to be pushed at Open Reach's end but they could not do this without a job no. This took 3 days to organise. The engineer then arrived late one afternoon and did his best but could not determine the fault and had to return to another job. It turns out that it ialmost certainly is the OR switch and we hope after over a week without internet , it will soon be fixed. Meanwhile, we installed a Vodaphone 5G system as back up-even if China can allegedly interfere with this! It seems to be performing better that fibre optic so we we may ditch OR. I hate poor service as my busibness would not survive if we gave this so I happy to ditch OR and never depend on them again at the first opportunity-JP"
Jago Cann,Bristol,8/11/20,"Moved into a new build property in July 2020 and as an existing customer signed up for their 'easy' home move system. All communication up to our move date was positive, orders confirmed etc. and 3 weeks notice was given. No internet on the day following move in so contacted the customer service team who said the line could not be activated because of a records issue. This was the company line for 2 weeks (we still were without internet during this time). After two weeks the internet started working but was not at the speeds we were paying for. I called numerous times and spoke to numerous people, each one as clueless as the last and it took these two weeks for BT to acknowledge it was there error and apologise!

I was subsequently told that BT would need to re-order our broadband and phone which would take a further days to organise and then another 3 to process the order. This was due to happen on August 10th. I then received a call saying that the order had not been actioned and that we would have to wait another week. This issue is still ongoing and BT have seemed to be uninterested in resolving for us. We are in a new build property so are unable to move to another provider and this is clearly why they do not feel any pressure in finding a resolution.

I cannot stress how little I would recommend this company. Throughout, I have had to chase and clarify details at my own time and expense and was also still issued with a bill during this period without internet access. This was only refunded after I raised this as an issue.

Terrible processes, terrible customer service and seemingly a lack of interest in getting our issue resolved within a timely manner. Save yourself stress and inconvenience by choosing another provider."
Henri,Crediton,8/11/20,"If I could give 0 stars for speed I would. We live in a rural location, HOWEVER across the street from us there is ultra fast broadband. We cannot get access to it because we are on a different exchange 2miles away. This means we get 2mbs while my neighbours enjoy 800mbs. We are all working from home these days and are utterly dependent on good broadband. BT does not care and will not help. I have spoken to them for 4years consistently trying to find a solution. Our jobs are on a knife edge and if we do not get better broadband soon we will have potentially lose our jobs and home. Tell me BT how do I explain to my 7 year old that daddy and mommy longer has jobs because of bad internet."
Elina,London,8/10/20,"Awful service! AVOID ! I was waiting for their engineer for all day which never turned up. At the same time BT bombarded me with warnings that missed appointment will cost me £130! It seems my time does not cost a penny ! To resolve a problem it takes 40 minutes of holding and listening their arrogant music. The problem never gets resolved from the fist attempt. What a shame! If I knew, I'd never sign contract with BT."
josh,derry,8/6/20,"absolutely great wifi speed, with my old provider i was getting less that 1 mb/s and now with BT im getting around 125 mb/s"
Mike Little,Faversham UK,8/5/20,"Three months no service this year (2020)
Five days after finally fixing the latest fault BT inform me my line is due to be ‘taken over’ by someone else.
Despite informing BT this is incorrect and being assured the process will be halted...BT end all my services. They then bill me £555.23 for cancelling my contract early!
Empty apologies, unable to reconnect without taking out a new contract and ignored calls.
Now failed to meet a promised call to discuss ‘my complaint’ (!)...

Truly truly awful. Please go elsewhere, this company are beyond self help

PS. I couldn’t give less than one star sadly."
Zeba,Birmingham,8/1/20,"Don't use BT if you live in central Birmingham. The broadband is terrible. I also had several issues with them when I moved apartments. I moved in the same block and they couldn't fix my connection issues. They made me wait 9 months after which I gave up and ended my service


Also they have absolutely awful customer service. You wait a good 20 minutes on the phone only to have no help until you threaten to leave their service. Complete waste of time and money"
Joao Coentro,Chippenham,8/1/20,"I made a change of house I took BT, but they started to charge the rest of the old contract, I called and they said it was incorrect, not to worry, 4 months later, I receive a letter from their company of 475 pounds debt recovery, and I'm still a customer. In addition to being incompetents,they are liars."
Ricardo Brandao,Swindon,7/28/20,"This has been the worst customer service I've ever received not only from a broadband provider but also from any service in any industry!!
Shocking lack of communication and always lying to their customers. Took them 33 days to fix a broadband fault!"
Peter,Southampton,7/27/20,"Shamobolic customer services, different excuses and story everytime I phone.

Given up trying to work things out, logged issue with Ombudsman."
Paula Dawson,Balmedie,7/26/20,Been with BT for far too many years and we have to keep calling about the same issues :( they can't even get our name and address correct. Diabolical Customer Services and never a person whose first language is british. Want stress free... don't go to BT
Steve,St Clears,7/24/20,"Un reliable broadband service which can only be guaranteed if you pay the extra cost of having a 4g router as a back up when the broadband fails. Usually 3 or 4 calls to 151 to get an engineer to your home who leaves saying there is no fault at the premises and has to investigate at exchange. Not happy with a service that costs a considerable amount more than competitors. I thought by using BT I would get a premium service as they owned the copper and fibre cabling as well as local exchange premises and hardware. Not recommended by me, as an experienced BT customer."
Timothy Goswell,Brighouse,7/24/20,"Bt just don't want to listen to their customers. They make promises which they cannot, and do not, fulfill. Getting to talk to a manager is harder than getting blood from a stone. If they actually did what they say they are going to do that would be a change for the better."
Gary,Orpington,7/22/20,"Unfortunately I'm unable to judge the speed or reliability of the broadband as I've been waiting since February for it to be installed and it's still not done.

Whilst I appreciate that there were obviously issues during lockdown, I had 3 appointments cancelled pr lockdown and have now had a further 3 since things have reopened. If I have the misfortune of having to contact BT, I'm usually kept waiting for about an hour until someone finally answers. 9 out of 10 times the person that I'm speaking with is unable to solve my problem so tells me that someone will phone me back. Nobody ever phones back. Last week I finally grew tired of it all and told the person that I was speaking with to cancel the order, to which they replied that there was nothing to cancel as there was no order in place! You really couldn't make it up.

To anybody who reads this and the other countless negative reviews for BT yet is still considering going with them, please consider using another provider and hopefully save yourself countless hours/days/months of frustration."
Stacey,Banbridge,7/17/20,"Quite possibly the most incompetent and shambolic customer service I have ever experienced! 6 phone calls and 12 hours of being on hold and passed about and we have now moved into our new home a month and still no broadband. They are completely useless! Would go elsewhere except we are still on contract. Biggest mistake ever, wish I had stayed with sky and that is saying something."
Nigel Cook,York,7/17/20,"Poor signal strength, only good when in the same room as the hub. Even then the signal strength fluctuates. Rude and abrupt customer service staff calling to ask why I'm switching to another supplier. Won't be returning."
Lee,Doncaster,7/15/20,I may as well put my monthly bill money and burn it. BT are worthless is almost everything they do and offer. From day one it has been slow and broken without any response. Small print prevents me from taking action and with a completely unusable service I am stuck paying for something that’s terrible. You should be ashamed BT but I’m sure you already know this!
Keith,Bristol,7/13/20,"Hopeless! I would be embarrassed to be part of an organisation that promises so much yet delivers so little. Unreliable Broadband signal and speed; promised 4 years ago we would definitely get Fibre - and still waiting; engineer comes and everything works for about 48 hours then starts to collapse again; there's always something that's not working as it should. With all the technology available, and given how much we all rely on it, Broadband / phone line should be as reliable as water and electricity .... but it never will be as long as BT have the monopoly. Can't wait for contract to end so we can move somewhere else (even then their antique copper wire will no doubt still trap us)."
andrew,Harrogate,7/11/20,"Worthless. 1hr wait first time, 1.5hrs seconds time. Promised £50 credit. Never appeared bloody worthless. Got about 5 channels only, not even main channels."
Philip Moroz,Wooburn Green,7/10/20,"Really poor customer service. Considering that they are a communications company you would expect a certain level of competence, but they don't seem to be able to communicate with themselves, let alone with their customers. To save you a world of headaches, please steer well clear of this company!"
James,Cornwall,7/6/20,"I have been with BT fibre for about 3 years now and to be fair, I don't get many issues.

But damn, when you do have an issue are they shockingly terrible at fixing it! I'll explain the problem I have;

2 weeks ago I woke up to not having an internet or phone connection. After a few phone calls (on my mobile) to BT they sent me an engineer the next day.
The next day arrives and the enginner turns up on time, all well so far. 3 hours later he figures out that my fibre cable had been disconnected from my port in the underground rack, broken in the process and put back into a different port. Basically a contractor stole my connection for someone else.
He then fixed my cable and plugged it in to a new port telling me that BT would need to disconnect my connection on one server and reconnect me on another as I'm now using a different port, which ""should take 24 hours"".

2 weeks and many...many phone calls later, they should have me disconnected from my old connection by friday the 10th.

So now I am looking at 3 weeks of no phone and internet for them to disconnect a connection and connect a new one. That is actually abysmal customer support and service on their part, for a problem that shouldn't have happened in the first place."
David,UK,6/26/20,"Stay away!
Horrible experience with BT you get missinformed from day one and then they change your contract and ask you to pay more without telling you.
Also they refuse to let you open a complaint and most of the people you speak to over the phone are racist and rude!"
John,Norfolk,6/26/20,
Tatiana,London,6/25/20,"I've been with BT for 2 years and everything was Ok until I moved homes. Since then it's a constant and very frustrating 2-month struggle to get connected.
During these 2 months I've been connected through a mini-hub as a temporary solution and trying to get connected properly as the mini-hub connection is really poor.
During these 2 months I've been in contact with BT a countless amount of times, spoken to many of their staff members, spent every time an hour on hold while they were forwarding me to different departments and trying to figure out what's going on with my account.
The inconsistency of their work is really shocking. Each one of them says different things and names different problems but the job is still not done. During these 2 months I got a number of contradictory messages from a number of BT staff members: your broadband will be activated tomorrow just connect your router at midnight, your broadband is in place but the landline is not, we need to send our engineer, our engineers don't go to the households due to the lockdown, your engineer will arrive on Wednesday, our engineers don't go to the households, your engineer will arrive on Friday, your appointment is cancelled, your appointment is rescheduled, our engineers don't go to the household, your appointment is cancelled again, your engineer has arrived and sorted everything out, connect your router, the engineer hasn't been there nothing is sorted we will schedule another appointment, your appointment is cancelled, get in touch to schedule another one, your package is fine, you are not at any package, no, your package is fine...
Halfway through they forgot to add some allowance to my mini-hub and I had to spend one day with no Internet whatsoever. And it was my working day so my work was paralyzed for the whole day.
After 2 months an engineer from Openreach arrived sorted out the broadband and the landline and the Internet was working for the whole day.
Next day the connection disappeared and another BT team member said that somehow my broadband hasn't been added to the package so I need to wait another 5 (!) days before it gets activated. I have no idea how after 2 months since my move the broadband hasn't been added to my package.
So far my experience with BT was incredibly frustrating and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Jonas,Romford,6/19/20,"The internet seems to work when it wants to work. Recently i was having too many sessions where internet just stops working, especially annoying when i wanna play games with boys and the internet just disappears.
Disappointing because there is literally nothing to do during the lockdown."
Neil C,Rayleigh,6/16/20,"I thought I was the only one until I read the reviews for BT. I am paying £39 PM for their Complete Wifi package. It is the most incomplete service I have ever experienced and they do not care about the customer.
I have had broadband issues every day since 20th May with speeds between 0.9mb and 40mb. Most times it is less than 10mb which kills my Sky Q mini boxes. A total of 5 engineers have been booked but only 1 actually turned up, the rest...who knows because BT certainly didn't know what happened.
I am thinking to cancel my payment and see them in court.
If you decide to go with BT, then you only have yourself to blame, I certainly regret it."
Fortnite,Wiltshire,6/12/20,Switched from Now TV broadband to BT and supposed to have over 50mb. Can't even use the printer and constantly lags and is buffering. Signal strength says excellent but it isn't and all troubleshooting brings us back to the internet. Never had problems with SKY or now TV. We got BT because it's cheap and it's shockingly bad always have problems. Do not sign up with BT
Martyn,Hamptworth,6/8/20,"Our broadband is hopeless. We have been arguing the issues for years with BT - it seems that they find a fix which is acceptable (barely), so we go away, and then a few months later, it all goes wrong again and back to square one. The ratings given would be 4 zeros if that was an option."
Eddie,South Wales,6/5/20,"Luckily my 18 month contract for 'Superfast' broadband is drawing to a close and I cannot wait to change. It may be Superfast somewhere, but certainly not anywhere near my router. There is a reason that you get 'Free' BT hotspot access with your package; the broadband in your home only works about a 3rd of the time so you'l, spend the other time connected to this hourly service. Oh, plus it isn't free when you compare the p[rice of BT to other providers.
Since pretty much after the line had stabilised I have had connectivity issues that have warranted engineer visits, numerous router replacements and constant resetting of the router and checks of the line. Regarding the router, I have no problem picking up my neighbours WIFI or even BT Fon, but can my devices ever find my own router? Of course not.

Trying to get hold of BT to discuss any issue is also an issue in itself. If you can navigate the web page and actually find their contact details they would far rather fob you off into their 'community' than talk to you in person. The fact that there exists a community of disaffected customers in the first place says it all, really.

Price wise, far, far too expensive for what you receive. Do yourself a massive favour and look elsewhere. I will not make the mistake of utilising BT again."
Angry BT customer,"London, UK",6/4/20,"DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACT WITH BT! Sorry for the capital letters but I really cant emphasize this enough. I signed an 18-month contract with BT. The broadband speeds were incredibly slow (less than 1mbps) to the point where I couldn't event open emails. BT were unable to fix the problem but flatly refused to free me from my contract. I consequently had to get my broadband from another provider (Hyperoptic) while continuing to pay BT every month for their useless internet...so two monthly broadband bills! The BT staff are extremely unpleasant too. Since their service is so poor I suspect they are unable to retain customers based on quality, so instead focus on making leaving contracts as difficult and time-consuming as possible. Their website is a perfect example of this. Avoid at all costs!"
DO NOT BUY BT INTERNET,Sunderland,5/30/20,"Everything they do is with the purpose of taking your money off you for a product you aren’t getting and they know they can’t provide. Guaranteed speeds, with £20 back if they don’t meet your minimum, actually means; they don’t monitor your speed at all and the ‘speed test’ app they provide to check it yourself, will tell you your speed is ‘as expected’, when it’s less than a 3rd of what you’re paying for. You’ll get £20 if they can’t fix your speed in 3 months and charge you £50 per month while you wait. Wow, awesome deal BT. I think the misinformation on the speed app is fraud, so I’ve reported them to Ofcom. One final warning before you make the same mistake I did. They make it as difficult as possible to complain. You can only complain by phone and each time you ring, it’s like it’s the 1st call you’ve made. I’m waiting for a manager to call me back. I’ve no confidence at all that they ever will. Apparently the call back was ‘guaranteed’ to be within 2 hours. I’ve since called back and been told I’m in a long queue and they can’t give me any idea when I’ll get the call. I feel like they’re stealing from me and I’m contractually obliged to accept it. THIS IS A TRULY DISGUSTING COMPANY. I’ve actually registered on Twitter with the sole purpose of warning off as many people as possible. Think I’ll start with #boycottBT"
SB,RBWM,5/29/20,"When it works (90% of the time) it's brilliant. When it does not, then customer support is a nightmare - press this, press that, hold ................ AND it's not cheap !
Had to apply for the credit twice when BT Sport went off line due to COVID-19."
3stan,Warwick,5/27/20,"Terrible company.
Had an issue with my broadband which took over a month for BT to fix. Made a complaint and was promised on 7 occasions that a case manager would contact me... None of which were fulfilled. 3 months of chasing them and they eventually came up with a compensation offer far lower than what thier advisors had assured me I would receive for the time with poor Internet connection.
Very little care for thier customers, often increasing monthly fees mid contract"
david womack,wymondham norfolk,5/26/20,"Absolutely useless company, been with bt for years but not anymore, I phoned to report my broadband kept dropping out and was below 1mb, Was told i needed the full fibre package and that would sort it out, Nothing changed only the size of the bill considerably increased, Since then they have come every few weeks to try and sort it including digging a trench through my lawn, All of which made no difference, All the engineers admit i am paying to much for a low service, But when you call the customer service department they seem to think the service is okay, No other provider can give me any better connection but they are a lot cheaper, So much for customer loyalty."
mario,Haslemere,5/22/20,"BT should be avoid at any cost from any one. Probably because the COV19 make them loose money they drop to less than 1GB my connection for the las tree weeks. I phone on BT so the man on the other side of the line say that :tomorrow morning we will send a technician"" and bla bla and then he change his mind and say we will send a technician in 11 days. Pedants, arrogants?? Avoid BT. That company make a realy bad name to Britain and they should be force to use a different name like ""The queens of the faults and the twenty arrogants""."
BT doesn't work,Scotland,5/19/20,"It is unbelievably slow, inconsistent and if you don't reset the router every 12 hours it doesn't work at all I have never been able to play my games without experiencing lag. Customer service is very poor sending you to someone who tells you to do what you've already tried and know doesn't work. Fix your connection problems,it isn't difficult"
Lorna,Isle of Barra,5/18/20,I have infinity two with unlimited calls. Great speeds. Only had a problem once which was due to a day when we had constant power cuts. Person on the phone was great and all it needed was a reset. My only complaint is the price at £71 a month while other providers are a lot cheaper. I have looked at their reviews and they are much the same as the bad reviews here and a lot of the complaints are about speeds dropping. Do I take a chance and go for the cheaper provider that’s y dilemma.
James,BUCKINGHAM,5/16/20,"Abysmal. Over the three years I've been stuck with this cowboy outfit I have been plagued with problems. Slow speeds, constant disconnections, price rises mid-contract, engineers not bothering to turn up, a thousand and one, carbon-copy answers which solve nothing.

Incentive gifts never turn up, mobile signal is the weakest I have ever experienced, the list goes on.

It even took them a whole year to get my name right on the contract!

I wish Virgin served my area by BT have the monopoly!

Avoid at all costs!"
Fi,Mk,5/15/20,"I cannot believe with every effort to pay the bill during this difficult time, you stopped my account even when I paid sat up a direct debit. Just for getting 7.5 plus charges to reopen the account? So horrible"
Arshad,Burton on Trent,5/14/20,"Absolutely disgusted with the service I have received from BT for past year I have had a fault where the Broadband drops intermittently, called them out Engineers are not interested in getting the fault fixed just keep telling me its an internal fault, eventually they tracked the fault to being external and still having big issues they say its fixed week later same issues never interested take days to come out and by this time your business will be finished.

You think I am joking please try BT"
James,,5/13/20,"Utterly abysmal! Constant disconections, never deliver incentive gifts. Took them a whole year to even get my name right on my account! Prices rise mid-contract, engineers don't turn up, a thousand and one excuses and the poorest service I have ever come across. Moved elsewhere as soon as I could! Disgraceful customer service."
Keith,Solihull,5/13/20,Have been with BT for a long time. Never had any problems. Re ently upgraded to fibre (FREE) and all is excellent.
David Ashby,BOURNE,5/13/20,"We have a complete package:-
Broadband
Telephone
Two Mobiles

Unlimited Telephone calls.
Unlimited Mobile calls and Data.
Total Price £100/month"
Pete,Noss Mayo,5/12/20,BT Best speed on a good day will be in the region of 3meg which is pretty poor. Giggerclaer promise the earth at 30mb but are way behind schedule and reviews from their existing customers dont bode well. BT is only option using old copper cable and we are some distance away from their box. On one outage BT said we had internal fault which we had to disprove at a cost to us! Only then did they send out an Open Reach engineer.
Cameron rowe,Leigh,5/7/20,"Disgraceful,never ever reply.
Bt hub the worst piece of trash there is,not happy."
Charlee,Farnborough,5/6/20,"I'm have been using BT Broadband from September 2017 (on 18 months contract bases). Generally, speed is exceptionally good (I can't say great or outstanding) but occasionally (once in 2 or 3 weeks) connection will drop, and the router will reboot itself and connects you back again. I'm okay with that as long as it connects without any issues.

However, the main problem with BT is its customer service. One needs to wait a long period in the call to get connected to customer service. Once connected, the customer service executive will listen to your query and raise a complaint saying, somebody will call us to resolve the issue. A couple of days/weeks later someone will call us and give some penny's compensation and do nothing about the issue. A month or 2 later the same issue again and the same process again. Awful service.

Apart from the these issues, I have been cheated on the contract term even though I have evidence in writing. It all started with my home move in 2019. I asked to move the services to the new address well in advance (requested placed on 8th July 2019 to move the services to the new home on 29th July 2019). During the call, the customer service executive said that I have to do the re-contract for 18 months again (originally my contract was 18 months) at the same price as before else I have to pay £120. I was happy to re-contract at same price rather than paying £120. I received a mail with the new contract terms wich saying like this ""Package - Broadband and Calls
Because you're moving home, your line rental contract will be renewed for 12 months, starting when your phone service starts at your new address. Unless we've agreed otherwise, any other contracts you have will continue until their original end dates."" I called customer service again and reconfirmed about the contract length (18 months). However, on the day of the move (29th July 2019) received a text message stating that there are some technical issues, the services move will be delayed. On 5th Aug 2019, I was back on broadband.

Fast forward to April 2020, BT started charging me more than my contract price from March 2020 bill. I called customer service and got to know my contract is expired. I was on call for 1.5 hours trying to explain my contract was not expired stating to the mail I received during the home move. If I was re-contracted for 12 months or 18 months, I will still be in the contract considering my services at the new home started on 5th Aug 2019 (it's been 9 months from the move). No matter however I try to explain to him, he is in no mood to listen to my explanation. He said BT will consider the time I spent at the old address into 18 months contract. I was referring to the mail I received during the move but he replied they can't listen to the calls recorded during the move (considering very old). He insisted to do re-contract to avoid extra charges. I declined and ended the contract. I felt like I have been cheated."
Eli,London,5/6/20,"Useless customer service, useless technicians who blame you and your devices for the slow connection. When they have fault they tell 2 different stories to 2 people in the same household. How nice ?"
Patryk,Cambridge,5/1/20,"We called BT help line like 10 times now and they all seem to be useless! The worst service ever rude and very unhelpful!! The internet is keep loosing signal all the time and all they say is that on they side it shows that is working just fine! ********!!! We paying so much money each month and they won't even try to solve the problem and if we want to finish the contract earlier we have to pay extra money!!! How does it work??? Really?!?! If you cant provide my house with a internet which doesn't keep disconecting how can you keep taking money from us!!! They won't even send anyone to check it or try to fix it... still same excuse, they say that it's working fine! That's just disgusting customer service and ripping people off!!! I wont recommend it to anyone!! There is so many different internat options on the market!! BT is a massive scam with the worse customer service ever!!!! I hope people relise soon how **** you are and this company goes down and whoever the rude woman was on the phone I hope you loose your job and end up on the streets as that is what you deserve for taking people money without providing the service you promised!!!

mark,lancing,4/25/20,"Utterly appalling service. Took at 18mths contract with BT, the rep on the phone convinced me to take BT TV though not that bothered about. Didnt mentioned that taking this extends broadband contract to 24mths and because I didnt read the small print as assumed it was 18mths as discussed am not signed in for 6mths longer than I thought and broadband offer only ran for 18mths so now paying more. This is an elaborate con and was miss-sold. Never to with BT again"
Jack Dudley,London,4/12/20,"I have used BT for the last few years and the internet would cut out once or twice a day despite having their fastest package and living in central london. I tolerated this.
I have now not had working internet for 4 weeks; 2 weeks completely dead and the last 2 weeks works 50% of the time at 2.3mbs

This has been incredibly frustrating and BT have no way to improve this. I have subsequently released myself from the contract. Good bye, for ever!"
Mohammed,bradford,4/11/20,wat a load of poo but super broadband is .. i wouldn't recommend it to no one at all.. its sooo slow .. i spoke to 3 people from Customer services .. 2 were okay and one was jus very rude .. the broadband is NOT RELIABLE AT ALL and speed test is a load of bull too .. Trust me and stay well away from bt .. absolutely waste of time
Sam Patchitt,Derbyshire,4/11/20,"I have been with BT for a number of years, since I moved out, and have always had broadband with BT. We are now moving house so we had to cancel for the short term as we are moving back to my parents. Because of the covid-19 outbreak everything has been put on hold. Having only beenndisconnecred for 1 week I called BT to ask if we could temporarily re connect, taking into account the current situation. They said there was no way they could do that and all I could do was sign up for a 24 month contract. I would have thought they could help out loyal customers but obviously not. I wont ever be using BT again."
deep_learnding,London,4/11/20,Pure garbage internet barely ever works I'm literally plugged in via ethernet and I can hardly load this website.
John Howard,EAST MOLESEY,4/9/20,I pay for infinity 2 and have a guaranteed download speed of between 65 - 75 Mbit but all I'm getting is 6mb. Cant get through to BT Can't even make a complaint as it goes around and round on their website. Absolute C**p
David,Inverness,4/4/20,"Robbing, scum bag thieves, would be a polite way of describing BT, my parents have been BT customers for over 40 years, I recently discovered they have been paying £52 per month for broadband and weekend calls. Here is the laugh, THEY DONT USE THE INTERNET, they were miss-sold this package without knowing the valve of what this type of package should cost, when I complained as their son, not only did i have to deal with the most condescending, patronising and rude customer services, but their response was that these accounts are self administered, how can you self administer when you do not use the internet?? if i had not have found out how much they were paying, then BT would still have been quietly taking their money, against their agreement with Ofcom!! I have asked them to refund these payments, they refused and offered £40 as good will gesture with an ultimatum, absolute scum in my opinion, avoid BT at all costs, the same package that BT had been supplying is available elsewhere for lest than £20"
Josephine Creighton,Benfleet,4/4/20,"Owing to the extreme circumstances we are experiencing at the moment, my daughter needed to work from home. I did spend a long time on the phone, but met some lovely people whilst doing so; all extremely pleasant and helpful. I had a poor signal in the room my daughter needed to work in and BT were able to help me sort this out.

If you need to ring BT, please be aware that the people on the other end of the line are doing their best in extremely difficult times. Be patient and be kind!"
Dragana Draganic,Manchester,3/29/20,"Absolutely terrible experience, probably the worst company in the history of telecommunications. Very pricey for low quality broadband unless you have a contract with them in which case you can not escaoe from them. I tried cancelling the service after my contract ended and had a horrible experience. The broadband was less than 10 Mbps. I was not able to cancel the service successfully and they continued adding extra fees to my bill for late payment even though I made it clear I will be cancelling my account. On top of that I had to wait for over 30 minutes in line before I gave up but at the same time I was being charged for a phone call. If I could give 0 stars I would have.
I have honestly never experienced any customer service as deceiving, money-grabbing and horrible in my life.

Please do your research before choosing a broadband supplier. I would hated to see valnurable people getting exploited by BT."
Trevor Taylie,STAFFORD,3/23/20,"Absolutely disgusting customer service. My father died last Wednesday after being in hospital for 7 weeks prior to his death.
Tried to contact BT on Friday to cancel the contract but unable to get through. Today, I managed to fet through, however cancellation will only take affect from today...not when he died.
Just a money grabbing, inferior broadband company."
Rubbish broadband,Streathm,3/21/20,Terrible broadband slow issues with internet at times sometimes wifi is slower than other days wifi router restarts on its own and take long to reset itself you pay for a service and don't receive the speed you of for still slow nd not a difference when buying a different pack
Dougal Trentham,winchester,3/18/20,TERRIBLE service. Penalised for being loyal- still paying £45/month when they are offering the same service far cheaper (£20/month). Do they not have a duty of care to inform you of better packages? PLUS I was getting 2-3mB not the 30mb minimum... compensation of £20 IF I signed up to a new contract! Absolutely appalling.
Craig,Kilwinning,3/18/20,"Had BT for 2 months now, had several issues, slow speed was the first. Guaranteed minimum speed of 32Mbps, any time i run a test with nothing else connected but my laptop, i'm lucky to get anything above 22Mbps. Phoned BT, customer support was good and attentive, they identified a fault, the BT engineer came out, and was receiving above 30Mbps. Four weeks later, it keeps dropping out, reported again, there is another fault with the line, speed is slow again. Waiting on it to be 'fixed'. Not holding my breath that it will stay fixed.
Also you should note, that with my previous broadband provider, the router where it was placed offered a solid wi-fi signal throughout the house. With the BT router, in the same location, the wi-fi signal is very patchy. This can only be on purpose to encourage you to spend additional on their wi-fi extender at £100 each.
I will be considering my options over the course of the next couple of months."
Nicholas,Thetford,3/14/20,"If I could rate 0 stars I would.
This is the first time I've EVER wrote a review about internet providers..
BT is horrible from the service itself, to the support ""they offer.""
*AT LEAST* twice a night, my router will turn off/disconnect broadband randomly during movies, games, etc.
There are no reports of outage or weather problems. Just an awesome added benefit you purchase along with your package.
Aside from when the actual service deciding to work on it's own will, you will not get what you pay for. Speeds are fairly reduced from the actual amount (and package you believed to have had) to pay.

To sum up this review, save your time. Save your money. Save your countless frustrations. Find a different more reliable service before you're stuck like me!"
Giulio,London,3/14/20,"Bt is a joke, not funny.
Very bad internet company.. they take more than two weeks to send an engineer to install the broadband, then he doesn’t show up and they give you another two weeks to wait.. Awful customers service, they don’t know how to deal with problems and people. I wouldn’t suggest it to anyone. I’m using it only because if I don’t I have to pay a year contract anyway, but it’s taking almost half a year to get my broadband working so... choose something else, anything."
Sonia Withers-Wilson,Brighton,3/12/20,"Paying for fast speed get just 12.5mb its appalling,and you cannot speak to a person to get resolved."
Tasha P,Surrey,3/12/20,"Shocking service, kept on hold for half an hour each time to then be told there’s a fault and your internet will be turned on no later than midnight tonight. Check the internet the next morning, still no internet and repeat this process every day for a week! And guess what, still no internet and still left on hold for half an hour when you call!"
Molly,Norfolk,3/9/20,"Awful - don’t go with this awful company! They do nothing but lie, cheat and make up excuses. Do not give them your time or money"
Jordan,Cheshire,2/29/20,"The worst customer service i have ever experienced.
They can change your plan without telling you. They renew your plan without telling you. Then they tell you your ""discount"" runs out then extends your contract past this point and then double your prices.
The manager that we spoke to was argumentative, withholding information and rude.
Ill never use BT Again."
Daniel,Grange over sands,2/24/20,Just had my final bill come in. I have been a customer of bt for the last five years and never missed an expensive monthly payment. My final bill is a criminal £307 that is literally just my cancellation fee! Won't ever be using BT again
Salman,Harrow,2/23/20,The most horrific broadband service I have ever known. If you’re reading this then please don’t frustrate yourself further by joining BT broadband. It never works especially on weekends when it’s required the most. I have made the biggest mistake by joining them. They have also been overcharging me every month and when I complained nothing happened. I’m being charged £4-5 every month on my bill even though I’m on a fixed contract. When I rang up to enquire they told me we have increased it while I was in a contract fixed at the outset ??? Here’s the thing it NEVER works
David Gosling,Frome,2/22/20,"I have been with this supplier B.T. over 10 years but now disappointed with the cost.
They did warn me of contract ending but now on expensive standing one.
The speed and reliable service is good but now considering a change due to cost and will do so if not reduced to a common cost of other providers in this area.
The only concern I have is the loss of service by doing so."
Fiz,London,2/14/20,Absolutely horrible. Always disconnecting
Keith,Solihull,2/13/20,"I am pretty sure that some of the less favourable reviews are concocted by other broadband companies to put you off using BT. Maybe I am one of tjhe ucky ones, but in all honesty I have had excellent servic e from BT. The only time I had to have an engineer in, was because of my own stupidity when making connection between the PC and router. I have found over the last seven years that the broaDBAnd has NEVER failed, that the speed is most satisfactory and the price is admittedly high, but it's the old story- you get what you pay for."
S Bond,Lancashire,2/12/20,"Very flaky broadband, difficult to report due to lack of customer service. Phone line does work sometimes! Would not recommend"
Peter Scott,Norfolk,2/12/20,"Is there a worse company than BT? I placed an order and had confirmation of it two weeks ago. It was supposed to be activated today. Having heard nothing I rang them this morning to see what's going on. Apparently the order HASN'T been processed because Openreach think there are two lines into this property. There aren't. They don't know the number of the phantom line and didn't bother to contact me, they just did nothing. Absolutely lousy service. I'm thinking I've dodged a bullet."
Nicola Gisborne,Newmarket,2/11/20,"Really stay well clear of BT completely the worst company to deal with . I have been informed that Sky are more customer friendly , BT staff do not care completely unfair have had issues since 13th December 2019"
Kyriacos Thoma,Manchester,2/11/20,Worst company ever. They were charging me £45 a month for a 10 Mbps connection. I was asked to make a 24 month contract to reduce the price to £25.99. They had no problem with me not being the account holder (my partner is). As soon as I asked to cancel the account to altogether and get a refund for the last months unreliable and expensive WiFi they said they can’t talk to me because I’m not the account holder. What a joke. There are definitely better companies out there. Do your own research
Heidi pond,Portsmouth,2/7/20,"I spoke to a guy called Lewis, From Newcastle, he helped me when I was moving my broadband. I've had some good customer service before but he's definitely up there at the top! Incredibly helpful. I know sometimes I'm a little useless and he was so patient, reassuring and explained things very well. Also amazing personality, it was like talking to an old friend. I really hope this finds him because everyone needs to be recognised! Straight out brilliant man (if you do read this Lewis, I got some savage girlfriend points! Flowers and everything! Sad right! Haha) thanks again!!"
Brad,Huddersfield,2/6/20,"Absolutely trash, crap upload speeds, crap download speeds, constantly disconnects and not to mention customer service is as about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Avoid BT like the plague not worth the money."
Sarah Barry,Vale of Glamorgan,2/6/20,"I've had issues with their broadband almost from day 1: speed, reliability, dropping out, buffering.... Speaking with customer services is soul-destroying. They are rude, unhelpful and will not accept responsibility. Avoid avoid avoid."
bean,,1/25/20,
Antonia Daines,Kent,1/23/20,I do not actually have BT wifi myself but I am a private live I carer and any client I have gone to that has had BT wifi there is always issues with the speed and reliability of their wifi. I think I have had more than 10 clients with BT and every single one has been such a hassle that I just use my phone data. Stay clear of BT as they are useless!
S Simington,Norfolk,1/22/20,Sold superfast upgrade. Once signed up BT had failed to check if they could provide service. Now waiting for upgrade of line and points. No date given for completion. Sharp selling and poor service. Do not hold your breath.
CharlieBoy,Kent,1/20/20,"Just a quickish compliment. Recently swapped back to BT from EE. EE was very good but in researching to get my bill down, I found that EE were about to cease their replay TV box which I used a lot. The EE call package was better and their TV box, I found better than Youview. Nonetheless I got a slightly better monthly price with which the new installation included fibre to the door and hub plus the 'complete wi-fi' disc package. The whole kit send, hook up and installation (about £39) was all trouble free and on time. I got near max (38MB/sec) speeds almost immediately. The first install only had one disc but I had a few weak spots and phoned up to get the other two they allow (they sent one at a time but that was fine, it gave me a chance to trial two only). I still had a bit of an issue in two spots in the house with two discs (three floors and a lot of metal) but now with three discs I have 36-38 everywhere including in a shed that's about 12 feet from the house (wi-fi signal has to punch through walls and windows plus wood of shed). All in all I have to say I'm very impressed."
Sean Hood,Newcastle upon Tyne,1/19/20,"We carried out a community funded project on our estate for over 400 residents to receive FTTP capabilities. We worked alongside BT, being made multiple false promises by their marketing team. As soon as the connections went live, they ceased all communication with us, and when customers had to complain about service, they were not interested at all. Worst display of customer service and lies from a large company I have seen for a long time. Zen is definitely now our preferred supplier."
Ian,Cartmel,1/16/20,"I have had BT broadband for the past 5 years at my current address and am paying £52 a month for super fast broadband 1 which is far too much. Went on the BT website and found that new customers can get the same service for £29.99 and then £37.99 after 24 months. I phoned them up to 're-negotiate' a new contract and was told that was what was agreed when I took it out so they can't give me a better deal. I told them I will leave if that's the case so she 'spoke to her manager' and said they could give it me it for £45.99 a month - still £8 a month more than a new customer once out of contract.
I've signed up for this price as I've never had a problem with the speed/reliabilty etc and looking at reviews for other providers they all seem worse than BT (unable to get Virgin in my area.)
It is disgraceful that a loyal customer should have to pay more than a new customer though."
Matthew,Essex,1/15/20,"Ordered on the 2nd December, engineer turned up 16th December then never heard anything back until I chased new year. They missed 4 appointments in a row, explained situation and why was important to be done by a certain date.. still not kept to date so was forced to cancel order. If that was the start of a new customer I was fearful what would happen if I had an actual issue. not pleased"
Jade,Green Hammerton,1/15/20,"Being fobbed off completely how rubish is this company

My partner have got them for broadband broad band was fine for a few months then they started cutting us off before the bill was due to be paid then after we paid it on the day it was due the broadband started to go funny my partner rang them up and they said that it's because it's under the stair case and because my partner has a ps4 on the wifi and some phones on the wifi which is exactly the same as when we started off so the sent a wifi booster so we can hard wire the ps4 which by the way seems a bit weird in how its set up we set it up and ps4 doesn't work hard wired plus the box then turns amber and doesn't budge and then my partner rings up about 7 times and the whole time they keep hanging up on him then we manage to get someone to stay on the line and he's now saying that we have to put everything back to where it originally was as you can't hard wire the ps4 the way we have been told
does anyone in that company know exactly what they are doing at all because to us all it doesn't seem like it which means there shouldn't be a bt company anymore"
Chloe,Southport,1/8/20,Had some issues with customer service in the past but picking up the telephone to call someone will get you much better service than live chat. Reliable service and speed. My price went up after 18 months but a quick phone call telling BT I'd found a better offer elsewhere and they brought my price down by more than half price a month. Highly recommend.
Ricardo,Oxford,1/5/20,"Worse decision I've ever made! I thought I was changing for a better supplier but I was complete wrong. Don't be silly as I was and join BT. They're just money takers and you will regret your decision. I have now two internet suppliers as BT never works!
Advice? Go Virgin! Best you can find."
daniel,boyle,1/3/20,"SOLD US FIBRE THAT DIDNT EVEN EXIST,CLAIMED WE HAD ACCESS TO IT IN OUR AREA....Without doubt the worst customer service ive ever experienced.Calls and emails completely ignored.My company took case to communications ombudsman and had all 6 issues upheld.You would never in a million years believe a company of this magnitude could get away with level of poor customer service.the sort of experience youd expect if you bought broadband of Del boy and Rodney.AVOID AVOID AVOID"
Blazej,Glasgow,12/28/19,"There is direct fibre optic to premises where I live - BT of course (monopoly).
The max speed offered at my address is 350 Mbs / 50 Mbs.
I ordered Super Fibre 2
which is 74 Mbs / 20 Mbs. I achieve 10 Mbs upload and BT says there is nothing they could do about it. This is how they screw customers at address where they have monopoly. I would never join them if I had a chance to choose other provider.
HOW CAN THEY OFFER 50 Mbs upload at the address and they can't provide anything above 10 Mbs?? I will never choose them again!"
Shaquille,Ely,12/23/19,"The most incompetent company I've ever had the displeasure of buying from. After attempting to set up a fibre broadband package at my new home, I was informed on my activation date that the original order wasn't even actually confirmed due to human error. I then attempted to set up my broadband package again. Two weeks later, on my new activation date, I was told that the order had been cancelled moments after I placed it despite the fact that I had not been informed and had made two subsequent calls to check on the order where I was told it was processing. It turns out they had tried to take over my neighbour's line instead of the deactivated line because, for some reason, when confronted by two active lines and one deactivated line, they assume one of the active lines is the one I'm attempting to set up broadband on. I'm currently sitting on my phone being told by a BT rep that they won't be able to honour my original deal now for reasons that can only be summed up as ""we don't want to do it anymore"", even though the only reason I don't have broadband at the original price is because of their own incompetence. I will never buy a BT product again and any BT rep I see standing on a sidewalk during a rainy day is getting splashed."
BT Reviewer,Manchester,12/19/19,"Appalling lack of clarity when getting broadband installed. I ended up taking days off work to wait at home for engineers that never turned up.

Please I urge anyone reading this to never get BT internet"
Luke,Edinburgh,12/18/19,"They allowed a takeover to take place without informing me about it and tried to charge me a cancellation fee. I was then promised priority re-connection which was a blatant lie, I was promised to be reconnected by a specific date which was also a lie. A code of ethics is missing in BT. Trying to charge me for their mistake (proof: text message informing me of the takeover came a day late and the letter was dated a day after my internet was disconnected), lying blatantly to my face, what kind of business practice is that? During the whole process, it took 3 different reps to actually get an apology for what happened, they made absolutely no effort to compensate me in any way for my inconvenience. In fact, Instead things kept getting delayed and I had to argue to get a refund done for the part of the month I paid and didn't use. In conclusion, if you want reliable service, professional and courteous customer service and ethical approach to situations, believe me when I say, BT is none of those. Do yourself a favour and go with literally anyone else. You will save yourself a headache."
Michael,Liverpool,12/14/19,"God awful people and a god awful service. They add hidden charges in to your bill but will never ever tell you what the charges are. When you ask one of the idiots at the help centre they can never, or will not tell you what they relate to. Ask for a full breakdown they will send exactly the same bill you are questioning. Be warned, you will never know what you are paying for. Don’t use this company."
Scott McCrone,Cupar,12/11/19,Very disappointed with BT 's customer service and broadband speed.
Sarah Brooks,Droitwich,12/9/19,"The broadband is okay but it does drop out. What really bugs me is their dishonest practices. I rang to say my broadband was not giving acceptable speeds and they said I should have been sent a new hub the last time I upgraded. They agreed to send it out free of charge. What I didn’t realise was that they renewed my contract at the same time - signing me up to another 18 months. They added Sky Sports, some HD thing which were free for three months and then started charging me. None of this was discussed on the phone. Due to some family difficulties, I didn’t check for a few months. By which time my bill had gone up from £27 to £65 a month. I called them and after TWO hours on the phone I got the sports and HD stopped and refunded. They said they could not listen to calls that were longer than six months ago. That they refunded me as a gesture of “goodwill.”
But I am still tied into a contract for another year. I will then leave as I find this kind of sales tactic unacceptable. I got the impression they are well aware of their dodgy dealings and the line “we can’t listen to calls made more than six months ago” is a well-used get out clause from admitting their dishonest sales practices. Shame on you BT. No wonder they don’t have Facebook reviews activated!"
Bob,Gloucestershire,12/9/19,"I've been at this property for approx 4 years. for 3 years and 6 months, the connection I couldn't complain about. approx 12Mbps, but it worked. probably dropped connection about once per week. either wifi dropped, or hubs connection to the net dropped. no real problems.

for the past 6 months (second half of 2019), the speed has gone up to 20Mbps (which is nice) but my connection has been dropping, probably up to 5 times per day, either wifi, or hub to net. it is starting to get slightly irritating. websites will stop responding for no reason, 5 second delay, then ""no internet"" message. wait 20 or 30 seconds and it usually comes back. I haven't contacted customer service about it yet."

David,Scotland,11/26/19,"Mistakes after mistakes
Transferred from Sky to BT on 18th November retaining my old number only to find out on 21st November they gave me a new number.

Customer service has been terrible trying to resolve this and I won’t have my proper phone number back until 5th December (large pinch of salt taken) so I would be very wary of any service commitments they make.

They also tried to charge me £25 for the privilege of sorting out their cockup.

Disastrous so I would strongly advise against them"
Ian,TETBURY,11/25/19,"over last 8 weeks BT Download rate has been well below the 52 Mb/s guaranteed value.
getting BT to address the issue (Indian call centre!!!) is frustrating."
Boggy,Kingswood,11/25/19,"If you want to get internet from BT make sure you place your order at least 6 months in advance. Last time i believed 3 and a half months just happened by mistake, but 6 years later it's the same. You just lose money taking days off work to receive a call before noon with ""sorry, can't be done today. Have a nice day!"". Well, i will sure have now, thank you"
Annon,Inverness,11/18/19,Worst company i have ever dealt with. All they are interested in is signing you into a contract then providing you with crap service. My broadband speed was 2MB! When i complained they said the small print states a minimum of 1 MB ! They then offered me an updated router for £70. Dont be fooled by the name. BT is crap. Ive since moved to talk talk. Excellent customer service. Excellent broadband speed and at 1/3 of the price.
Anon,British countryside,11/17/19,"Honestly I can cope with the crappy broadband speed, what really pisses me off about bt is how often there’s a problem and we just lose internet all together. I’m a student and I have a whole lot of my work online, I rely on the WiFi heavily, so when there’s ‘an error on the line’ so it just doesn’t work and I can’t do anything it’s bloody inconvenient. Inconvenient doesn’t even describe it and I would be a lot more vivid if I could. If I could I would give it 0 in broadband reliability and overall satisfaction. Our WiFi has stopped working altogether multiple times and each time they **** around for a while saying that an engineers coming and then that there was an error and they can’t so it’s delayed and I end up going weeks paying for extra data and piggybacking off the school WiFi and my friends hotspot which costs me money and isn’t good for anyone. On top of this because of where we live I don’t have service anyway so I’m not contactable for a while and can’t do anything. The only reason I wouldn’t give customer service 0 is because I have pity for the poor ******* who work for this company. We pay £30 or something a month for this and honestly I think we should be paid for the torture which is using bt.
NEVER USE BT, ITS HELL. (Especially if you live in the countryside)."

Calin,Bath,11/15/19,"I am very disappointed of this company.

Prices always go up during the contract. When contracts ends they charge you more than normal. The internet speed it's not great. During the night the internet sometimes falls.

I will NEVER use BT again in my life."
Sophie,Shocklach,11/13/19,"We went with bt as the previous tenant was with bt and we thought it would be a straight forward swap to our name. This was not the case ! We had an order for the phone line and internet to be changed into our name (which apparently you need an engineer to come out 2 weeks later to do) when this was done, we recieved a new number ..we requested from day one to keep the previous number as we were running a business and that was the number our customers where familiar with. We were informed that as soon as the order was completed we can ring up to confirm the number change, So we did. We were then informed that the number would be changed within 24 hours .... 24 hours later the number was still not changed. After ringing back the following day we were then informed that there was another order on the account that had to be completed before the number could be changed. As we had not placed an order they cancelled the order and told us it would be another 24 hours before the order would be cancelled and then to ring back for the number to be changed. So as you can guess we rang back 24 hours later to change the number to then be told someone didnt cancel the order so they would cancel it and it would take another 24 hours ( why it takes 24 hours to press the cancel order button I do not know! ) since receiving our bt order on 5th November we are still waiting to have the number changed back to the original number! After being on the phone many days and many hours I was finally passed to a supervisor who informed me that IF I WAS TO PAY FOR THE BUSINESS ACCOUNT I WOULD RECEIVE A BETTER SERVICE! Which we were told at the beginning it will be easier to stay as a personal customer for now as that is what the previous tenant was and that it would be easy enough to change at a later date! After speaking to this supervisor I was informed that he would cancel the order and he would call me back to re arrange the phone number change between 11:00-13:00, did I recieve a phone call ? NO I DID NOT! I rand up at 13:02 to find out why I hadn't recieved my phone call and the lady on the phone said she had passed the message on for me to get my phone call. The NEXT day I recieved a call which was not from a supervisor and was informed there is nothing they could do as I'm not named on the account even though they have been speaking to me everyday since getting Bt and everyday they recieved permission to talk to me and permission to change the number! All we want to do is have the original number back on the landline which has took 8 DAYS so far and still counting ..."
No one,Liverpool,11/12/19,"WORST INTERNET EVER! I've tried many different service providers but this is the icing on the cake when it comes to bad internet! There is no internet full stop! The constant connection dips 24/7 is ridiculous! My emails don't even come through for days coz of how bad it is! I can't even game online anymore coz the lag is unreal and embarrassing and everyone keep telling me to switch my service provider coz it's trash! Don't ever go with BT, It's horrendous. I connected it to my phone but it doesn't even connect to my TV. Absolute trash!"
Michael,Cumbria,11/11/19,After 90 days I finally managed to get broadband ordered. I had to chase BT up for info all through the process instead of them coming to me and the text messages I received bore no relevance to my order. After all that the final guaranteed speed that they can give is an abysmal 3Mb/s
Anonymous,None,11/6/19,I feel like every one of the reviews for every service provider is automated by the opposing competitors to extend the likelihood of finding different providers.. by was good for me yet the reviews are insanely bad. I got a good deal and had to sign off of it as I literally didn't need it because I bought a phone contract that gets 100gb data a month..
Callum,Newry,11/5/19,We pay £87 a month for shocking broadband. The download speeds are appalling and the speed test online states they are not able to process the speed - which is a complete cop out. Disgraceful having to pay this amount of money a month for such poor broadband
Reuben,Stoke,11/1/19,
Frank,Gloucestershire,10/26/19,"BT should restructure their appalling customer services operation that has completely ignored my complaints. I shall be moving to a more professional provider as soon as I can, and I strongly advise others to avoid BT."
Katrina Barry,Ystrad Mynach,10/25/19,"BT are the worst. I have bought extenders, upgraded the hub, splut the signal bought more discs, upgraded the service and still have a terrible broadband signal. It pulses and drops out. Only works next to the main hub to watch a film, slow everywhere else in the house. BT only guarantee a signal everywhere in the home, yes I can see the broadband, but it is too slow to use. Avoid at all cost, read their small print, do not guarantee a useable broadband, only guarantee it to the house."
Ajay,portadown,10/24/19,"Bad customer service,they dont value your custom"
Lukasz,Radstock,10/24/19,"Very bad company, call them 5 times already, they did send enginer he change the hub for New but internet still keep dropping out, low speed even if I choose the highest option, So pour customer Service keep telling the same lies, they cant deliver good signal, stay away from The company"
Tiffany Holland,Nottingham,10/22/19,One day the wifi just stopped working. It has been two and a half weeks and it's still not fixed. Their communication is terrible. No one knows what is going on. It has cost me time and money trying to do the job Im paying them to do. Worst broadband.
JORDAN,LONDON,10/22/19,"The worst experience I have ever had. I would look to use anybody but BT.

If you enjoy 2 months of hell with a customer service team who are completely inept then this is the service for you.

I have never come away from working with a company with such a passionate distaste for them.

CHOOSE ANYBODY OTHER THAN BT"
Jude,"Battle, East Sussex",10/21/19,"I have been trying to add ""complete wi-fi"" on to an existing package. This costs an extra £8 per month but would solve issues we have with thick walls. To sign up, our BT TV package will only last 18 months and BT broadband 24 months. This will mean a 6 month gap and pressure to sign up for another contract with BT. This is a risk that could be too costly. Very disappointing."
Graham Hugo,Canvey Island,10/19/19,"I was approached by BT to sign up for another 18 months and that would involve me going on to BT plus. At the time my line throughput was 41Mbits/s. This speed remained constant for a couple of months and the it started to drop and eventually went down to 10 Mb/s. I rang BT and unfortunately had to speak to their Indian help desk. I had to remove all connections from my router and went through all the tests until the last test where I had to hang up. No call back on reply. I rang them again, a different agent. He insisted I go through the testing sequence again. Again I was told to hang up. Nothing again. At this point I gave up. A friend of mine who works for Openreach measured my line and said there was a high resistance fault probably on the pole outside. I rang BT and fortunately got a British operative who logged it as a fault and three days later an engineer came round and fixed the fault. All well and good I hear you say. No. The throughput speed came up to 25Mb/s. I had somebody ring me to see if I was satisfied. I said no. They decided to send me a new router. I installed this and this one had a software field that actually measured the line speed. It said it was running at 30Mb/s however testing with their own software and Ookla line speed tests it has now dropped to 20Mb/s. The router says it is running at 30Mb/s so what am I to conclude from this? It would appear to me that their network manage to system is throttling my line down to 20Mb/s. As a result of this and poor customer service I shall be voting with my feet at the end of the contract"
Vida,Kensington,10/18/19,"We have received help from Tyrone both yesterday and today. He was very devoted and exceeded our expectations. He fixed an internet issue that we have had for a very long time and went the extra mile as he came in extra early the next day and made sure the problem was fixed.

Many thanks from Bective Leslie Marsh team at Kensington."
Buvenekaba Kumararatne,Albrighton,10/12/19,"very poor broadband speed
had some work done 2 months ago. But says it is not connected every time we contact BT
This service is very poor
We need an explanation for this delay"
Mike,Westcliff-on-Sea,10/8/19,"Worst broadband experience. Broadband kept on cutting out, after multiple attempts 7 engineers, I finally managed to cancel my contract and get a full refund of charges. Very, very frustrating though, useless broadband. Back with Sky now, not had a problem."
Jon Taylor,,10/6/19,"After 6 weeks of trying to get internet installed, it’s pretty obvious BT have some huge internal system/process issues, I have experienced 4/5 times of having conversations / orders placed only to find out that the relevant email/sms does not reflect anything ‘booked’ on their systems.
On top of that the complaints procedure is obviously a token gesture as it’s quickly closed followed by a experiencing exactly the same issue you complained about. Overall absolutely abysmal service."
Tarun,London,10/5/19,"So, I've come home looking forward to watching Netflix after a long week, and my bt internet isn't working. I have tried the 'on off' method as you do and it doesn't work. I checked the status and apparently it's 'good' in my area. Been on the website and tried to test the landline number and the page goes to an error. It hasn't worked the whole day and when I try test the connection it goes straight to an error page. This is poor from a big company as they do not state any recommendations, fixes, or even acknowledgement of the issue. I hope it is fixed soon as I pay good money for the service."
Lawrence Osborne,Walsall,10/1/19,"Not been with them long but cancelled this morning absolutely rubbish service,we have gone back to our original supplier . The straw that broke the camels back was no phone and no internet again this morning. Being pensioners nearly 80 years old we rely on our internet a lot. When we went with them we thought that they would come and set it up but you have to do it yourself so l had to get someone in to do it."
hilary,london,9/21/19,The signal drops at times. Had issues with promised package not delivered. It took many stressful attempts before I got something like the first package offered. Did not support my fragile mental health.
Dave,London,9/13/19,"Had 12 months of serious broadband issues, now have issues with a mobile service too.

Let me explain - I noticed broadband connection issues, called out their Openreach guys, fixed it so no problems right? - Wrong! lost connection 3 times more, engineer sent out, he hooked up terminal to my line box which displayed a different number, so he went out to check, returned to say my private line was unplugged (stolen) obviously previous engineers working etc - then told there's ample space for new lines etc - then fixed issue and made report back to BT. BT sent the standard email eg: case closed, then line got hijacked again - altogether lost about 2 months internet time, which after months of phone conversations was eventually credited to my account.

Took out a 2nd service - a mobile phone contract approx £372 pa for I Phone SE (6 year old phone!!), which was a 'recommendation' from 'Sales Dept' - sounded ok, biggest mistake I made -- phone battery issues galore, to a point where phone battery depleted from 8 hours a day (only switched on, and no other usage) to a mere 3 hours after a full recharge!

BT wouldn't take responsibility, tech support was refused, so got passed to Apple instead. Problem was the battery, Apple sent just a refurbished replacement model, not brand new or a newer model offered.

Moving on 7 months later - they double billed me due to 'automated billing system error' - which messed my finances up for 3 months, BT tried to stick me with an engineer call out fee of £180 - based on their customer service suggestion and insisted a broadband check be done at my end to help solve the slow speed issue.

Fault was found to be BT's and not damage to my equipment etc - so another credit made to my account - I should think so.....

Forward a few months and I paid my mobile bill by credit slip at my bank. BT sends me a reminder to restrict my service etc, I explained it was paid 20 days earlier, assured my service was restored, but I owed them £55 for 'other mobile services' which they couldn't explain what these extra's were - actually illegal as all charges must be billed in detail which this wasn't - I questioned this, requested in-depth details and promised to pay once proper itemised bill is forwarded - but none came, yet their still trying to bill me for a non existent extra that I know I never requested as my bill is just for the phone and is one charge only for unlimited calls. so nothing else to pay.

They then sent me a further reminder, threatening account termination, along with debt collection action and that I would be stuck with extra fees for non-payment etc - a very aggressive letter indeed. If only they checked their bank account to see the bank transfer, hmmmm. So got proof of payment from my bank, agent reconnected my service, but few days later - BT disconnected me again for reasons unknown.

Don't get me started on the nightmare call transfer system they force on their customers, or the rude agents intent on blasting policy instead of active listening skills that should be employed to understand the mere basic of info needed to sort an issue."
Rob,Leicestef,9/13/19,"I don't understand why some people have such problems. I have been with BT for nearly 2 years and they are amazing. I use them for broadband and mobiles, and they are ALWAYS sss helpful.I am so pleased with their service I have extended my contract for another 18 months"
Keith,Coventry,9/12/19,"I started with BT almost 3 years ago after moving to an address where Virgin Media was unavailable. I had no major problem getting started with BT with everything being as it should be regarding my phone, TV, Sport and Broadband 'package'. The contract was 12 months. There were no major problems in that first 12 months, however when coming to renew I had an email from BT before the contract expired offering me a Broadband renewal at a reasonable price but with a contract for 18 months not 12. I spoke to them via their helpline but was told 18 months was now their minimum contract period. I agreed to this. A few weeks later they contacted me again about my TV and sport contract!!!!!! I thought I had just renewed this but it turns out the verbally agreed renewal was just for the Broadband BUT the TV and Sport package were now a minimum of 24 months. So, there is the major problem - how can I watch the final 6 months of my TV and Sport package if I decide not to renew my broadband? Sneaky. Having spoken with my wife we decided to go ahead with the TV and Sport as we had already committed to the Broadband.
Fast Forward 21 months - suddenly realise that my monthly bill had shot up to £80 from around £40. I contact BT who tell me that I am out of contract with my Broadband and therefore have no 'deal' and the price has risen to £52 (a lot of money, especially as I can only get a maximum of 25mbps where I live via FTTC) I point out that BT did NOT contacted me regarding the end of my broadband deal but obtained no explanation or response from the BT 'assistant'. I enquired about reducing my cost of my existing 'plan' by cancelling the BT Sport and TV package that to be honest we don't watch much at all. In this day and age of Netflix, Youtube and other streaming TV services, BT's TV is not an attractive proposition. This is probably why they hike up the price of their broadband post contract to offset the lack of customers taking up their TV options. To cut a long story a little shorter, my BT 'assistant' could not offer me any sort of decent broadband deal so I am cancelling everything. My 'early termination' charges are way lower than remaining with BT so I'm off. Having placed an order with a different supplier for just Broadband and phone line, (NOT a BT subsidiary of EE or Plusnet) I am now receiving text messages from BT asking me to reconsider. To be fair to BT, I was never unhappy with the Broadband and had few drop-outs and would have remained with BT for many more years, however, due to their underhand sneaky price hiking and contracts of unequal length designed to trap their customers, I will NEVER trust BT again. Deals can be agreed and negotiated but trust cannot. Goodbye BT - Forever."

Forward a month and my bill increased, called again to complain and was told the previous advisor should not have agreed that , made a complaint and was told they would look into the complaint .

Ruth,Dundee,8/30/19,"BT are dishonest and made us agree to an 18 month contract without telling us that it was 18 months. They hide this information in order to tie people in. Our tenancy was only 12 months so we had to pay a large cancellation fee(almost £200!). Their customer service are also difficult to deal with. I had no problem with the broadband itself, but it is dishonest to actively try to trick people into signing an 18 month contract, especially elderly or vulnerable people. A company which is not to be trusted."
Chombo,Ashton under Lyne,8/30/19,"18 month contract with BT, first few months everything was ok, good speed and reliability, then things deteriorated rapidly. Speed dropped and is now half of what I was promised, connection drops out constantly. I have complained on several occasions and was advised to reset the router on a weekly basis, reset it once but then for some reason it wouldn't reset again. I am now in the process of switching provider and am hoping for an improvement but one thing is for sure, I won't be returning to BT."
Plax,Kettering,8/29/19,"I am so disappointed with BT, I had no broadband connection for a week I contacted them and this was resolved, however was told I won’t be charged for the times I had no broadband, however the bill came with full amount which I had to pay. I contacted them online and was told we are going to refund you and you will get an email within 3-4 hours. I waited all day no email came. Decided to contact them again today and was being tossed around different agents and for 50 minutes I got no help. Was patient bough to remain connected and waited for them but they wasted close to an hour of my time with no help at all. So this means am going to pay for the times I had no connection and it’s always very slow seems they also switch it off at night i don’t know. Am glad my contract is ending soon, so."
Carole B,Bryn Port Talbot,8/26/19,I went from EE to BT as you are supposed go be able to get fast fibre broadband in every room. Yes you can if you buy into extra discs for every room. £10 extra for each one per month. Rubbish coverage. Can't wait for my contract to finish. Don't do it.
andrew,manchester,8/22/19,i am locked into a 24 month contract with this bunch of cowboys and want to warn anyone else not to fall into the trap i have. Do without a service rather than get it from these guys as the stress is not worth it
BT Sucks,Omagh,8/22/19,Why is it BT continually get it wrong. Very simple these shysters increased the price of my BT without my knowledge or consent. Spoke to them and they hung up. Spoke to them and they said we sent an email (didn't get as it was in spam) said your in contract and that's it. How do these lick spittles ever expect to keep me as a customer when they literally robbed me.
JW Lowe,Cumbria,8/22/19,"Broadband went dow. Engineer appointment with a 5 hr window. Traveled 220ml, 5hr round trip and waited. When no show contacted BT was told engineer was on his way. Again no show. Found out that engineer had phoned in sick that morning. It appears then the I was deliberately deceived ie I was lied to. 2 further deadlines set by BT for fixing the problem pass with still no broadband. No update and no contact from BT. Me, I have wasted a further >2hrs on live chat to be told everything will be resolved soon
Unacceptable service delivery, unacceptable customer service. But worse is the deception, being lied to
BT - another customer gone, never to return - I promise!!"
Andy,Cornwall,8/7/19,"Absolutely abysmal service and threats for BT

Have been with BT for may years was out of contract and looked around and found I was paying about twice as much with BT as I could get with other providers. Contacted BT and asked if they could give me a better deal which they said they could they offered a couple of pounds off not the £35 need to be competitive. Asked for a PAC code but due to technical problems they could not give one. This went on for a couple of weeks but eventual got my PAC code and left B. They did however finally offer me a deal which was £1.00 more expensive than the company I transferred to. But there was no way I was going to stay with them after the way I had been treated. Was sent a final bill which I paid and have now spent a further month receiving threatening emails from BT. Saying they would be sending round the bailiffs and destroying my credit rating if I did not pay. This despite me having raised a complaint with them. Absolutely abysmal service will never ever go back to them."
Sara,Maidstone,8/6/19,"BT= BIG TROUBLE
BT is the worst company I have met so far. I have been with BT since January and since the beginning, I have told to BT to make sure if they can provide the service they were offering because I would need it. They kept saying that absolutely they could provide me and guarantee me a specific speed. Well, since January I complained as they never ever provided me with that speed that they said they would and that I was paying for. I spent so many hours to try to help them in solving the problems and having engineerings in and out, for absolutely nothing! Plus, they kept saying they would call me and they would not. I normally do not write reviews but this I really had.

BT the worst ever in service, price, and communication."

michael Woodcock,Matfield,7/30/19,"There has been a major issue with our broadband we have been without Broadband since 19th July, tried to update to a BT Plus customer on the 22nd July to upgrade to fibre. 10 days later we still have no broadband and I have been told this morning that our upgrade order has not been accepted yet due being stuck in their system and wont be connected at the earliest on the 1st of August, when we might get our broadband connection back. BT blame their supplier - meanwhile we the customer have to suffer!! it seems incredible that in the modern world that we live why they cant sort this problem out! The BT Mini hub supplied as temporary fix is practically useless. I will definitely be looking elsewhere after this distressing and frustrating experience!!!"
Silverdel,Somerset,7/30/19,"Rubbish speed, less than 50% of advertised, very poor customer services, resorted to contacting CEO of BT and even he could not get an engineer to sort out the problems. So sick of being on the end of poor connection, and poor customer services."
Mr Maurice McPhillimey,Maybole,7/29/19,"I've been a BT Broadband customer for 13years now, the fast its been is 210Kbps or 0.21Mbps. The longest I've had in without breaking down is 6 months, the engineers do their best to fix the line. It's just BT who will not and never will update the line, I have been told I'll never get fibre superfast broadband. Because of where I live, they have never been helpful about my situation..."
Barrie Young,York,7/29/19,Absolute crap service. BT promise much which their arms length engineering service then admits cannot be delivered. Anyway who can trust any salesman who promises infinity? Any school kid would tell him it is unachievale!
John Haugh,Cheadle,7/27/19,"loved BT from the first broadband I had.
Then the cost sky rocketed and 8 times out of ten the speed was not what I was supposed to get.Sky have given to me the same speed and the cost has almost halved
When BT say they can guarantee super fast broadband surely lower speeds should be as good"
Marius,Weston-Super-Mare,7/24/19,"Look no further, the worst ""ISP"" in the WORLD is here!!!
300 meters from exchange, they could only provide 12mb download (most of the time is 3) and ""not guaranteed"" upload
But it never went totally down for more than an hour, can't find other good thing to say :)
Customer support...call them if you want training in being a BT engineer
Got a few months left with them, cant wait to get rid of having to pay a bill for that useless broadband connection."
S,Ipswich,7/18/19,"Don't bother paying for anything more than their standard broadband. If you expect superfast fibre, don't hold your breath. My download speeds got slower and slower until I was getting between 2Mbps and 7Mbps and constantly got interrupted. I pay £50 per month for superfast fibre and it is an absolute waste of money. An engineer has already been out, it was not fixed, then a second engineer who didn't arrive and then a third appointment was made. I am moving on to another provider as enough is enough. What a waste of money and time."
Jim,Pontyclun,7/12/19,"Not the cheapest or fastest (Except Virgin)as all others use Openreach and are limited to whatever speed that they can provide.
If there are problems BT respond/correct usually within 24hrs."
JJ,Gloucestershire UK,7/9/19,"I hadn't had broadband before and had heard that since BT controlled all the cabling that their service would be best. How wrong.
To start with things looked good. An engineer turned up on day arranged and installed line. He said there might be teething problems and to get in touch if so.

I did . I needed the link for my work and it is vital I have live connection when I broadcast. The link kept dropping out. I raised query.

An engineer was arranged to come out (this took far more time and trouble than I can relay here).
I realised I would be at a wedding and called help line to rearrange (again more time and faff than I can relay) I was told that was sorted.

Then while away I was texted to say an engineer would call on the OLD date - would I be in or did I want to cancel (my only option in the circumstances was to cancel!) then - as I suspected, no engineer turned up on new day.
I had raised complaint and a complaints person rang me to check out if line was now working. This was exactly as I was communicating via the awful chat line system (see below) with another so callled 'helper' to try and establish if and when an engineer would call. The complaints person said they'd ring back . The help line person asked if I wanted an engineer to call. I explained that one was due to be visiting but emphasised YES PLEASE. The operative terminated the on line call without sorting.

I now have a complaint on top of a complaint on top of a complaint - The service IS AWFUL.

Years ago I used to work in project management for Comms . I can honestly say that service levels have gone down the pan and customer service is not fit for purpose. Out-sourcing to a foreign country in a completely different time zone and in a completely diferent language, different culture, different etiquette, is a HUGE mistake. No axe to grind with the individual helpline people on the other end: Its not their fault. The model is wrong. The system is broken. I am going to see about cancelling and going elsewhere. Except i suspect more grief and heartache awaits en route. This is no way to live a life"
Mike,Kent,7/4/19,
Ben Middleton,Reading,7/2/19,"I read the reviews. It’ll be different for me I thought. Let’s try BT. What a mistake. Left Sky for BT business on Superfast Fibre.
Day: 1 No phone or broadband connection. Call engineer to fix, sorted later that day.
Day 2-4: No problems, great router.
Day 5: BT inform us we are leaving them in 2 weeks but we can change our mind and stay.
Day 6: BT terminate our service and give our telephone number back to Sky. Business now in turmoil - no receptionist, no online access. Numerous telephone calls to BT. Can’t find our number, join the complaints queue, no action being taken as we aren’t their customer any more. So much for the 2 year contract.
Day 7: Give us our neighbour’s telephone number.
Days 8-14: BT place 4 new orders, none of them right.
Day 15: Today. We have our telephone number back but broadband now cut off.

We have lost £1000s in business over the last 2 weeks, not to mention face/reputation. I am absolutely livid with them.
For God’s sake, for your sake, don’t go with BT, they aren’t fit for purpose."
Muhammad farrukh,London,6/29/19,"Worst broad band and customer support.

Have been receiving 2-5 mbps since last whole week and what bt have done so far is sent me rj11 cable as fix.

During there test they confirmed that the speed from bt box to my router is 69 mbps but from my router to pc 1-5 mbps through ethernet which they don't guarantee.

So they expect customer to sit on there router and suck the speed and transfer through telepathy because all there claims are just up to the router. And after that they dont give any guarantees that you will receive the same speed to your devices.

First they tried to exempt themselves by saying sir you might be using wifi which i wasn't then they oh our speed guarantee is up to the router.

On ther adverts of stay fast guarantees speed consistently but all there advergs are scam and full of lies.

On top of that when you ask them that you are 2 mb they ask for 7 months old email evidence that what you guaranteed speed.

These guys are proper scammers who are only punctual in deducting there direct debit and when it comes to customer support all they donis restart your router and send you cheap cables and max 5 days worth of broken days credit.

Horrible post sales customer support.

Every year there is apain.. Last three months twice the services have crashed and they are busy in finding loopholes.

It's a simple effing transacrion. I will pay you money you provise me services. But they believe in making customer life a living hell.

Lies excuses and loopholes. Thats what there belive is and ripping customer.

Go to any other provider exept bt. My honest opinion"
Andrew,Aberdeen,6/28/19,"Do NOT use BT, there inability to conduct a home move order and successfully complete is astonishing! An active line that gave previous tenants internet and phone at fibre speed seems impossible for BT to takeover? They promised a new line at no cost then cancelled that order too, I’ve been over a month waiting and 8 cancellations. They promise to call you back but not once have I had a callback I have always had to call them. The latest call took over an hour with no change on the order.

I would highly recommend you look elsewhere, the perceived reliability of BT is unfounded and it is not worth your time and effort. Pay more for someone else if you must, just don’t trust them with anything."

I' off that's another dissatisfied customer you have lost"
almghtytoby,Essex,6/23/19,"Please stay away from BT. Awful company. Lost my order twice, spent hours on the phone trying to sort it out. Lied to on several occasions. Phoned to cancel within the cooling off period as I was very annoyed. Told by customer services that as a gesture of goodwill my contract would be reduced to 12 months from 18. After 11 months, I phone to cancel and apparently there is no record of this conversation in my notes or on my file. I have 'superfast' broadband at 13mbps (the lowest speed guaranteed in my contract) - my previous provider was standard fibre which was faster. One positive is that it has been pretty reliable.

I will never touch BT again and will tell everyone I know not to either."
Chris,Doncaster,6/23/19,"Been with bt for 6 month and had problems with speeds and drop outs constantly, after numerous amounts of engineers and phone calls they have finally sorted the speed out but the constant drop outs make this pointless. After deciding enough is enough I rang them to terminate my contract due to them failing to provide, I got told it would cost £300 by the rudest woman I've ever spoke to, I've now took the situation further."
Steve K,Lincolnshire,6/23/19,"Appalling Customer Service; 'take the money and run attitude'.
Poor email host with no support whatever. SHOCKINGLY SLOW SPEED.
Terrible Overseas polite but brainless helpdesk IF you can even contact BT!
Everything that is wrong with Globalisation but with nice shiny 'we are family, love puppies and care about YOU' Advertising campaigns to keep sucking us in!"
Andy,Nuneaton,6/23/19,Absolutely terrible provider. Have run tests over 30 days and I have not received above 33mb but pay for 64mb. 1 minute it is fine and the next it will slow down to below 1mb at times. I 100% will be contacting the ombudsman to have the contract contested.
Jeremy Lynn,London,6/19/19,"BT are a disgrace to the British telecommunications industry.

I recently discovered that I was paying £40 a month for an ADSL line. On a separate bill I was being charged £240 a year for the line rental.

Meanwhile my internet connection kept dropping off, so I decided to take the plunge an upgrade to BT's Superfast Fibre.

You would think that as an exiting customer with a working BT landline that might be a simple enough process. Ring up, choose a package, pay for it?
You must be joking.

I was on the phone to BT for a total of 99 minutes that day.
After some discussion as to what I wanted and selecting the package and agreeing the price (£39.99 a month) I was told by the salesman that because I had just consolidated two accounts he couldn't process the order for 48 hours. We arranged a time 2 days later when he would call me to process the order. Needless to say he didn't call and after sending him an email a colleague of his rang.
The colleague then told me that he needed to transfer me to a different department as I was a business customer. I then began the whole process again with a woman who told me that the price offered to me (and which I could see online)was only available to new customers. So for being a BT customer for 33 years I have to pay more.
Eventually when I told her that I was not prepared to pay £50 a month and had already agreed £39.99 she said that she would process the order at that price.
Then she told me that there was a problem processing the order; she needed to place it with the ""back room team"" who were not available as it was a Saturday.
I was told that they would e-mail me confirmation of the order no earlier than Monday of the following week.
By Wednesday I had heard nothing so I rung BT and had two calls each over 40 minutes. Having again agreed the package and the price I was put on hold. Minutes passed and whilst idling on the phone I started looking at other providers and discovered that Zen offered a faster fibre bb at the same price with a guarantee of no increase at the end of the contract.
So when the BT salesman finally returned to me to say that he was ready to place the order, I told him that I was sorry but had had enough of BT and would be going elsewhere. No order was placed and I bid BT farewell - or so I thought.
After placing the order with Zen I was told by them that there was an open order on my line. That was a week ago. Since then I've been batted back and forth between Zen and BT - the former saying they can't process my order because of the open order on the line, BT denying that any such order exists.

Last week, in one such call, I was transferred to Kevin in the Loyalty Section of BT who told me that he was able to offer me the same package at £29.99.
I told him that it was too late for that, I'd had my fill of BT.

I've had several conversations with BT over the last few days all insisting there is no impediment on the line that would stop the transfer.

Meanwhile I have had a letter and an email from BT thanking me advising me that my new fibre broadband is on its way from them. When I ring to ask what these messages are about, they say it's just a computer generated letter, and again swear blind that no order exists.

It's impossible to find out who is at fault here, but I can see no reason why Zen would be giving me false information, whereas I am getting every indication from BT that they are frustrating the process of transfer as best they can.

I haven't gone into the detail of some of the utter stupidity of what they are telling me, the fact that you can never speak to the same person twice, the fact that they cannot transfer calls internally, that they cannot send you an email on an address that can be replied to; the fact they they sign emails with a name that is not in fact their name (eg. Mike Lincoln is Mike who works in Lincoln). All of this designed to make sure that you can never get back to the person who had assured you that they were on your case.

Just a horrible sick joke of a company."
Phil,Sandhoe Hexham,6/18/19,"promised fibre broadband was available in our new home however BT engineers say we are too far away from the distribution box. called BT and they said we were still eligible for fibre broadband. very poor customer service
Currently have ADSL speeds of 1.6"
Seth,Meltham,6/17/19,"Awful, awful, AWFUL network, they set you up with a contract and little by little make your internet speed worse and worse, they promise good speedy internet (which just isn’t what they provide) and then they expect you to pay £400 to get out of the contract, it’s a cheap scam and no one should deal with internet like this, disgrace and embarrassing company"
Alex,London,6/16/19,"I have been a business customer for several years with BT and had the worst experience ever. For a few months I had one constant issue with BT business broadband in connecting to my card machine which is a lifeline to my business,a lot of customers do not carry cash,so after they dined and wanted to pay, they had to walk quite far to use an atm and a few times customers did not return to pay. I phoned BT faults department and they would take me through a few procedures to reset the connection and after a few attempts the fault re-emerged ‘Connection failed ‘. I contacted World Pay card machine provider and over the few months they changed the card machine twice in an attempt to see if it’s their machines are faulty. This was not the case and World Pay kept asking me to contact my internet provider (BT) I had enough of this constant issue that I decided to change internet provider and giving BT a months notice to terminate my contract. I was furious when I received my final bill payment and BT charging me an extra month for leaving, when I contacted BT about this they said there’s nothing they can do as they don’t have any record of any previous complaints. After wasting so much of time and effort to try to resolve the issue and to remain with BT this is what I get offered a £30 reduction, it’s an insult to all I have been through . I have never experienced such a bad level of service and this is a warning to all and specially businesses to keep their distance from BT.
I find it an irony that when one calls BT one is constantly reminded that the phone calls could be recorded for customer service."
Caitlin,,6/7/19,"Terrible experience.

We received our router and set it up but the service didnt start on the date promised. Many calls later we were told that they forgot to add our address to the system.

They cancelled our order and said that they would add it to our account again and start the service the next day.

This didn't happen. Weeks and many phone calls later they still haven't sorted out our internet. On top of this they're threatening to charge us for the BT Hub that they sent us! It's not my fault they haven't set up the service on their system yet. Appalling."
Ioannis Bazianas,Hayes,6/6/19,"BT has been amazingin both advertised and achieved speeds (currently getting 82/18 on Infinity unlimited), as well as reliability. I have literally forgotten when the last time my internet connection was down due to a fault.
HOWEVER; a huge caveat is that I'm using my own router. I consider the router that BT offers to be extremely subpar in router specific functions. I'm not talking about wireless signal or USB ports, I'm talking about routing; WAN, NAT, DMZ, internal bandwidth, portforwarding and the stuff that routers need to do! In all of these, the BT routers are not suitable.
Same goes for their support. It is one of the least helpful and cooperative I've encountered, so it is a great pleasure to me that the reliability of the line is so great as I've only ever needed to call them once in 7 years, and that was NOT to discuss connectivity, but router problems.
Provided you have your own good router, BT is a dream."
Laurentiu,cf44 8ll,6/5/19,"Terrible: First month the internet speed was good. After, little by little in a few weeks from 52 MBs was going down to 2 MBs
Was impossible to use internet. But They advice me upgrade package for a better speed!!!
Also the bill was increased little by little and end up paying 5.65 pounds more. See your bills regularly, you may have a surprise !
I have give up BT."
Oleg,Bournemouth,6/2/19,"During 18 month contract broadband speed disappeared almost every month for a whole weekend. Even contract said that speed should be 52 MBps, I never get more than 32 Mbps with a Green Box located 25 meters from the house. During contract time monthly Direct Debit fluctuated several time by increasing from 34 to 35, then back to 34, then it increases to 38. If it is fixed monthly Direct Debit. It should be fixid. But not with BT. When contract ends they switched you automatically to the highest price service, without properly informing you and offering something instead of your ending contract. They making changes to your Monthly direct debit without properly informing you about that."
MJQ,COBHAM,6/1/19,"I pay for a 30mbs service and never receive more than 10mbs.

It is impossible to speak to anyone at BT

Could anyone recommend a better service?"
Terry Webb,South Derbyshire,5/29/19,"BT Broadband customer for over 10 years, poor service, speed maximum DL 2.2 Mb/s. Complained many times over last 10 years same results. BT says I live too far for exchange, I live less than 6 miles from a major city centre & less than 1 mile from 20 Mb/s plus locations. This in 2019!"
Justin Browne,Whitby,5/26/19,"Just switched from BT to Talk talk today and what a relief. I was initially promised a monthly bill of £27.99 a month for 18 months....and...since that ""promise"" my bill has steadily increased to £42.99 over that period for simply Internet (no TV package and I don't use a landlines phone). It's simply annoying as they cannot keep their word. When I phoned up today I was hard balled for about 15 minutes by a sales rep claiming they were much better than TakTalk and as a ""valued"" customer they would revert my bill back to £27.99 a month for, yes you guessed it.....the next 18 months. I actually laughed at her down the phone and said ""you promised me that last time and TakTalk are offering me the same speeds etc for £25 a month"". I was simply met with ""you will receive an inferior service"". Wow, desperate, unprofessional and simply rude. I will never return to BT as they are a dinosaur company, over charging loyal customers and using hard ball selling techniques best suited to time share agents of the 80s.....au revoiur BT. Xxx"
William Wood,East Kent,5/21/19,"Many speed dips down to a few MB/s download. Use the BT app to check and miraculously they find it's fast.
Switching to another supplier, BT told me ""they will be just as bad as we supply the infrastructure""."
James,Northumberland,5/16/19,"Have been with BT for many years but will probably go else ware when my contract is up. There customer service is terrible and know one cares
When you take out you contract."
Emma,Devon,5/14/19,"Absolutely terrible, salesman misled me to believe I was getting something else for my deal, didn’t even process the order correctly which meant it had to be deleted and no one from BT told me. When I complained I was advised that for each problem I have to speak to each team and complain - connections, sales and billing. Absolute waste of time; they do not care about their customers just your money."
Marius,Weston super mare,5/11/19,"I couldn't get different registration numbers for my multiple complaints about speeds of 2mb download, which is a contract breach.
They cannot provide better service where i live, in weston super mare town centre, 300 meters away from the exchange. It's not like I have the cheapest service because i wanted to, but even that fails to stay within the contract guaranteed limits.
I will go to citizens advice and ask if there is a way to cancel the contract without having to pay a fee.
If anyone knows of what legal actions could be taken against them please share it."
Marius,Weston super mare,5/10/19,"In Weston super mare, near town centre, 300 meters from exchange and they could only provide 17mb download and 0.70 upload.
I have to connect to 4g if i want to attach a picture to an email.
I might as well send a pigeon with it, just stick to 4g or get broadband from any other company...even if they use BT infrastructure they can provide better speeds.
Just unbelievable how they can be called ISP, i'm waiting for the day I can cancel without a fee more then I am waiting for my bank loan to end."
Jasmine Miah,Bristol,5/7/19,"It's been 4 weeks and still nothing. Business has been running 3 weeks without no service. Each adviser says different things each time. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. 
NEVER AGAIN.
MY BUSINESS HAS GONE THROUGH SO MUCH LOSS BECAUSE OF ITS LIES"
surensoy,london,5/6/19,"BT is worth company in UK.I am not recommend anyone, this BT company is bully and robbery from customers. I did contract for my business with them,I was make 1 contract with BT ( broadband and phone)together, when I made contract from the beginning, they didn't explain me for closing and cancel charge, now I was closing down my business, then i called them and explained them, that time they said me, you have to pay for cancellation fees for £183.15, i was accepted for this fees. I paid them £183.15 already on March 2019. Now they send me another Bill £475.64, So i called them, for what you send me another Bill, So they said this is Broadband cancel Bill. Can you believe this?? Now they said separate cancellation payment. who can pay for that amount £ 658.79???
Before i paid £183.15 , I called and asked them for this is last payment final Bill or not?, they said this is final Bill for Cancellation.
But, now they said this is another bill with different reason.
when i find solicitor, i will Sue bt company"
Tony,Suffolk,5/2/19,"Speed's actually not bad.... but the service and the company is absolutely atrocious. Operators have lied to me, they fail to call you back, they fail to follow through with problems. BT have just employed a new chief exec and he doesn't even come from either a consumer or telecoms background. This company is BROKEN. One of their executive level complaints team admitted that they all knew the customer service was terrible and claimed that was the reason they bought EE... so that they could show them how to do customer service. How these people have a licence to operate I'll never know."
Laure,England,5/1/19,
Steven Holdcroft,Bude,4/27/19,Constant low speed or no internet at best 0.13 mb download and 0.03 mb up load.
carrotmunch,Bury St Edmunds,4/27/19,"horrible service. They talked into 18month contract with package I don't need. and paying nearly 60 pounds for it. and they talk you into expensive contract although I informed them I wanted to reduce my monthly bills. After 18month, never again, with BT."
Jade luker,,4/27/19,
Ann Chapman,Caister-on-Sea,4/25/19,I agreed a broadband deal on line. They cancelled my phone and broadband with sky on my behalf. They sent me several emails stating a date when my router would arrive and the date when my broadband be started. The day came I set it all up and I had no phone or broadband. I waited up till midnight when they said it may take till. Still no broadband. The next day I went to work when I came home still no phone line or broadband. I phoned and after waiting for 15 minutes for them to answer the phone was told that there wasn’t a portal for them to connect us to so the order had been cancelled yet no one had contacted me. I was told that I would have to wait 24 hours then ring back again to re order. So I did just that to be told on this occasion that I could only have the copper connection and had to go on a waiting list for the fibre connection and there was no time frame. I had to wait for someone to cancel theirs and then take my place in the queue. Also that I could not have my google home as agreed on my previous deal as it wasn’t on this copper one. Maybe when I finally got onto the fibre they would see what they could do. I can’t believe that a big company like BT couldn’t still give me the gift as some sort of compensation for all the inconvenience That was caused by them. I am absolutely disgusted by them. Do not go with them their deals are a scam as they don’t know until the date of connection if there’s an available portal. All to late as your previous supplier will have been cancelled.
Hill,birmingham,4/25/19,What disgusting company they transfer you to operators 5 time before anyone can help when you constantly repeating yourself I had problems with my broadband for over a year every month was calling bt to fix it am paying for a service they can provide and they make up lies saying there's no information about the faults would waste my time and money I have cancel my broadband I will not be paying them anything there a SCAM please customers read the over review on here and trust them don't sign up to bt they will dragy for stress and you will be fighting with them every month to get your boredband right.
E M,London,4/25/19,"I've recently been experiencing a lot of problems with my so called BT ""Super Fast Fibre Optic Broadband"" speed (lots of buffering), internet channels unavailable and with the Broadband dropping intermittently. We frequently can't find the Broadband to connect to even on devices which have been logged in constantly. When the phone rings or a landline call made, it disconnects the Broadband and has done so from the outset, the engineers have not provided a solution. As BT have a new Smart Hub 2 with Wifi Disc to sell, I have a suspicion they're messing around with our broadband to force us to ""upgrade"" to their new product, for which there would have been no need as apart from the Broadband dropping out when the phone rings, was fine, coverage in every room was not a problem until very recently. I smell a big BT rat."
Miro,London,4/24/19,"Horrible service - on the phone they claimed I would not need to pay for an old contract if I get a new more expensive one. I specifically asked if upgrading meant paying for the old and the new contract and the rep said they would leave a note on my account for this conversation. Of course they sent a £200 bill for the old contract, on top of paying for their Superfast Fibre 2. When I called they said no note could be found on my account and I should wait for the charge to come through and speak with my bank about reversing the direct debit. After the direct debit came through the advice was I should have done something about it before it, and nothing could be done now."
Rta,Coventry,4/17/19,"Moved from SKY after 12 years, to BT, and said £29.99 month and free £70 loyalty card after 30 days. BT Delayed the Broadband 30 days as error at BT end so we had no Broadband for 30 days now 120 days later no Loyalty card and they say its not being sent now.Do not use BT,they promise things to get you on board, and after you sign 18 month contract, they do not pay the rewards.Going back to SKY at contract end"
Tracey McCormick,Nuneaton,4/15/19,B T are liers they tell you one price which was 34 a month broadband it was always 67 a month customer service is crap they rob off you
Nikolas,Wimbourne,4/15/19,"I am currently using the BT smart hub 2, and the reliability of the hub is absolutely amazing, the costumer service is even better,Pages load up in a flash as-well as downloading Files ."
Mark,Retford,4/12/19,"Don't know where to begin. Changed from TalkTalk to BT on the hope of internet in every room. Five weeks later, I have no internet. BT gave me a start date, sent the equipment, ended my previous supplier, and then left me stranded. We run a home business, requiring internet. This hasn't seemed to bother the countless BT staff we've contacted. They're all 'sorry', and promise to resolve the issue, etc, but nothing gets done. It's a broken business. I've contacted my MP, because this appalling service should not be allowed to take place.
I'm speechless."
Grahan,Coventry,4/11/19,"Useless.
i got lied to when i set up my contract... the operator told me verbally 12 months they sent paperwork for 18th months( i didn't check my Fault) .... convenient they didn't record the call.
constant drops in service with no explanation.
changed my direct debit date from the 10th so i got 2 months worth of bank charges and damage to my credit file.
called 4 times to set up paperless so i wasn't charged took them 6 months to get it done correct.
there India complaints dept calls and there accent is that thick you cant understand AVOID BT."
Rostam,Kingston upon thames,4/9/19,"Internet kepts cutting around 30-40 times in a day, as a gamer you can’t rely on it to play a single game without worrying about it being cut mid-session. Tried calling them about it and they said they cut it and also slowed my internet down because of “excessive usage” (downloading files, in my case it was a single ps4 game mandatory UPDATE from the legal market where every player has to update their game) on a contract that says “unlimited internet”. All i have done is watch YouTube video and amazon prime."
houston,BT403TR,4/8/19,"Why is my broadband speed 0.9 mbps!!! what a rip-off, no wonder the Netflix drops out after 10 minutes!! and has done for over a year!! you should be ashamed of yourselves, forcing people to upgrade, to watch a programme."
Melissa,Shirley,4/8/19,"worst providers I have come across EVER !!!! we have the same trouble every month and every time we think it's sorted that crop back up. The internet is shocking and we end up having to use 4g on mobiles most of the month. The bill is an absolute nightmare ! we phone to pay every month and ask them to change the date of the direct debit, they have always said it's done and we have the same problem the month after and then we have to pay late charges. this month is the first time we have been told that the direct debit can not be changed and they have no recorded of us being told we can change it. staff can be rude and the last conversation I had I told the lady I was thinking of leaving and she hung up on me."
john bailey,kingshurst,4/4/19,The service from bt is terrible I have boasters in every room in the house. I am sat less than a metre from a boaster and every few seconds it disconnects. This has to be the worst internet provider. Funnily enough this has only just been happening since they put the offer of paying so much a month to guarantee connection in every room. This looks like a money making scam to me
Michael Stevenson,Manchester,4/3/19,"Don't know why I bothered to change my contract to them after the horrendous situation with the Internet. The Internet installation got delayed by 3 weeks, 2 missed appointments and a general lack of knowledge throughout the call centre. Decided to get a BT sim only through temptation of free BT Sports and a cheaper plan. You have to call to activate BT Sport, why someone can't do it via chat I have no idea so, a 15 minute hold later, asked for DPA, gave my details, asked to hold for a minute while my account gets pulled up and the phone gets put down, no call back. Get back on to chat to be told the adviser will call me and connect me with that team to receive a call and be told they've closed. Absolutely outstanding customer service."
Sam,London,4/3/19,"Absolutely atrocious - sent hub to the wrong place 5 times, cancelled engineer visits automatically, different teams had a diffferent view of the same problem, 4 people on the same day confirmed an engineering visit until the 5th saw the service provider (open reach engineer) had rejected the fault problem and the engineer never showed.

POS (and that doesn’t stand for point of sale).

Terrible, the worst."
Lu,London,3/27/19,"Completely unacceptable company.
They said they will send engineers and they said that 10 times and never came!

They made no effort to fix the service and they do not care about their customers at all.

Do not choose BT."
Nikolas,Watkinson,3/26/19,"Amazing reliability, even better customer service then Sky,Virgin and Talk Talk. Totally recommend BT especially Their new BT smart hub 2!!!!"
Adam McCluskey,Herefordshire,3/20/19,"BT have been useless from start to finish. Firstly, their records were incorrect so we waited 2 weeks for fibre to be activated, only to be told its not available (it is, I can see the exchange from my house!). After a 2 week investigation they realised it was available, and said I could upgrade over the phone and receive their offers of £120 gift card, and an amazon echo - not too bad I thought.

After waiting two weeks, was told that I need to wait a couple more days until I'm outside the cooling off period. Lo and behold, then I'm told i'm not eligible because I didn't upgrade through their website (which was impossible, because their records were wrong). Despite confirming with 4 different members of staff (and counting) at BT that I would receive this, the rewards team still tell me I'm not eligible.

The customer service at BT is shocking - the teams cannot speak to each other, and the live chat function is 95% automated, and 5% requires a translator so equally useless.

Don't bother with them! Talktalk, Vodafone, and Virgin offer the same for much less - lesson learned."
AeroJ,London,3/16/19,"Had Fibre Broadband since 2011. BT Infinity was my first taste of superfast broadband back then. In the last 8 years have tried Sky, TalkTalk and PlusNet but back with BT since 2017 and will stick with them as had numerous troubles with all the others. For me BT has proved very reliable with 99.999% up time and great speeds. The one time my router failed they replaced within 48hrs, and when the line from my house to telephone pole had an issue they had OpenReach out to fix within 12hrs, on a bank holiday weekend! My internet connection is essential to my life, BT not the cheapest but so far have easily proved the most reliable. Came on here as my BT contract was up and wanted to check out ratings for some alternative providers who were offering some amazing deals. However weighing everything up I think I'll pay the extra and stick with BT as (in my area at least) they're delivering a pretty solid service. NB - I have SuperFast Fibre 1 and get 67MB/Down and 18MB/Up which is well above the advertised speeds so very happy with that and more than enough for my needs, even with 5 smart TV's in the house!"
Lennard Allen,Bridgend,3/16/19,"The worst company I have ever used to provide me with any service, EVER.
Avoid BT. Wish I stayed with Sky."
Andy,Leicestershire,3/16/19,"Wishing is read some reviews before changing my broadband provider. My change was supposed to happen yesterday. I had an email the day before from BT saying this could take upto 11.50pm and they would contact me once the service was available. Still not working when I went to bed last night. This morning my old talk talk broadband is no longer working quite rightly, no message from BT, still no BT internet my computer gave me a number to call BT which I did, told the phone system what the problem was and my phone number..... waited......'we're sorry or offices are now closed"" so thru didn't think to have that message at the start of the call then"

Donna Byrne,Keighley,3/13/19,
Dwayne Jackson,London,3/11/19,"I live in a two bedroom flat in central London and BT's internet service was so poor that I could not use services like Netflix, Amazon Prime or Youtube. The wifi signal was too weak and even using basic internet services, like online banking, was unbelievably slow.

In my experience, BT's internet/wifi service is useless. I spent 3 months talking to BT customer service representatives trying to resolve the issue. Nothing BT suggested improved the situation so after 3 months, I joined another internet provider. BT then informed me that I would be charged £225 for breaking their contract early. In my opinion, BT should have refunded me for the months I paid them but didn't receive a useable service.

BT: Terrible internet service. Outrageous customer service. Avoid BT. There are better service providers out there. I will never use BT again."
Marlon Lucas,Frimley,3/11/19,"Advertised as minimum 65Mbps download speed. Lucky if I get 55; mostly 40-50 in the evenings when most people including myself wish to use it. Not good enough really. 20% incidence of signal lost during viewing films etc. Very inconvenient. I have tried everything I know (BT speed booster, router next to computer and TV; no additional user in house)make no difference. BT Customer services claim that there is no broadband fault and that my speed is maximal. Not so. Will be looking elsewhere!"

Bought the ‘super fast fibre BB’ package on the assumption I’d be fed from the new cabinet!!
Oh no...... they’ve left me on an old cabinet routing that in 4.1km of twisted copper pair, so I fluctuate between 1.6 and 3.7mb.
They won’t re-route me as it is an engineering expense to them, and I fall into he ‘superfast fibre’ category between 2-5mb.....crap!
Not happy does not cover my experience!!!"
Donna Byrne,Keighley,3/5/19,Just been on the phone 50 minutes to make an appointment for a follow up appointment due to broadband not working. Ridiculous still not any nearer. Now 15 minutes into BT online chat - it's a joke. Stay clear of BT - do not use them unless you want to be put on hold where you can hear all the staff laughing in background and nothing getting done
Andrew Nicholas,Neath,3/5/19,"Ripping off the country. Am I the only person that can see this?.. In 1996 CableTel dug up 90% of the streets in the UK to install fibre optic cables. CableTel was soon to become NTL in 1998. 2002 I moved into my new property. NTL we're offering fibre optic broadband where you had to have a BT line to subscribe. I took up the offer which was giving 16mps download speeds runnining 2 PC's which is faster than I have on BT's ADSL standard in my recent new property. BT phoned me to upgrade but declined. After declining, my broadband sped has dropped. We could use 2 gaming consoles, a laptop and phones the same time no problem. I rang them up to complain about this and told me that I'm on the old copper cable.. I pissed myself laughing asking ""What copper cable?"" Virgin and Telewest took over NTL contracts, you can't get Virgin without a BT line, so BT have owned the cables since NTL went bankrupt. I told him on the phone that if he could prove to me that they can supply the whole country with broadband through a copper line at speeds of 10 to 18mbs then I will take up the offer, as I know that broadband has always been FibreOptic, otherwise we'd be on dial up. It's a massive con and we are letting them get away with it."
Todd,Banbury,3/3/19,"Unexpected, amazing service.
I spoke with Michael, form the case management in Liverpool (that wat it says on the text send to me within an hour of my conversation which was at 8.20 pm!), who was amazing and went above and beyond of my expectations. Usually, I am not happy with BT, but on this occasion, Michael sorted out everting within an hour (I was expecting to wait about two weeks and to make a few more calls, as usual).
If BT had more agents like Michael, I would definitely consider moving my mobile service and my cable TV to them.

Thank you Michael,"
Mac,England,3/1/19,Our WiFi hasn’t been working for 3 weeks because they wired it wrong and they keep saying they’ll send someone to fix it and just keep delaying over and over. Absolute joke really
Nimric May-Garber,Swindon,3/1/19,"The cost of the service is too much. You don’t get any offers. If you are struggling for your contract payment and need to downgrade, this isn’t possible. I am cancelling as soon as my contract runs out. If I could do now I would. So Do think twice before choosing them."
Karolina,London,2/27/19,"Honest review - broadband is really good (5/5), customer service is ok - bur pretty slow sometimes on online chats (4/5). BT rewards - good idea to introduce these but 2 months passed and still waiting for my card to be sent - have contacted them several times already, lets see if I will ever receive it (2/5). Also i didn’t really like that I have been charged for 2 weeks from ordering to installation (1/5) - either installation time should be reduced or they should charge for the broadband from the day that it is actually installed. Overall, pretty impressed with broadband but they should manage other things better."
Amanda.,South Lanarkshire.,2/27/19,"Never had a problem with my package. Fast connection, reasonable price and they have given me amazing customer service every single time."
Mic,Eastbourne,2/26/19,"Terrible. 3 weeks into contract we haven't been connected to the internet yet. They promised an engineer will come 3 times but no one came. Customer service lies as what happened today.

Avoid BT. Worse service ever.
Lost a lot of time and days waiting for an engineer which never came. Failed promises over and over again."
Isa,Eastbourne,2/26/19,"Very unreliable company.
Very incompetent customer service and LIARS!

After numerous phone calls and their failed promises 3 weeks later they have not fixed our broadband yet. They will twist things and make it your fault.

Not worth it. Avoid BT.

From very unsatisfied customers."
M.Downward,Moray,2/25/19,"Having spent a great deal of time ""chatting"" to BT persons on a few occasions, I am still not receiving the super fast 2 broadband speed which I am paying for. I am not sure which way to turn now as when I moved house 10 years ago, I was torn between BT and another company I was with to getting a working landline and broadband in the new home...it cost me time, more money and considerable stress. ""Chatting"" doesn't seem to resolve matters......"
Krisztina,London,2/23/19,"Rubbish company, service and customer ""care"". Will be cancelling ASAP. Useless... Had nothing else but trouble with our broadband since day 1. AVOID."
Jonathan Desmarais,Biggleswade,2/22/19,"No issues, just expensive"
James,Lancaster,2/18/19,
Karli,Scotland,2/18/19,"Absolutely shocking, been on the phone for nearly an hour and still no answer! WiFi can be slow, had a big problem with the mobile phone and now have issues with the landline!"
Adam,Derbyshire,2/14/19,"Dreadful from start to finish, countless problems trying to setup in multiple houses
The Call centres they provide are next to useless, their english language skills are awful and their technical skills and knowledge even worse. Had BT broadband in 4 different properties and its been intermittent and dropped out all the time and never been the speed quoted. Overprived and you can find much better deals out there now."
Ryan,London,2/11/19,
Catherine L,Brighton,2/8/19,Shocking service left me without broadband for a month. Never go with BT.
Mrs J Ford,Fort William,2/4/19,In my (long) experience of BT I can say that BT provides an appalling broadband service. Although the exchange is across the road from my house the download speed is now only 0.23 Mbps which makes broadband almost unusable. (There seems to be some continual problem at the exchange). Yet I am told that this is an acceptable speed! I am paying £55 a month for this service plus phone calls.
E Winterbotham,IP18 6SJ,2/2/19,
Rich,Abo,1/31/19,"Been without Internet for a week, Even though BT promised to have it sorted on 3 different occasions, today Open Reach tell me it will be out for upto a month. BT's response is to pass me from pillar to post, ending up with Paul from Cardiff. He read continually from his notes and kept going on mute to write more notes saying the same thing !!! To be honest an absolute disgrace, I've been with then for 20 odd years and they are happy for me to be without Internet for a month but won't let me cancel my contract - that's how to keep customers - what a service !! - appalling from top to bottom"
Brian,Wales,1/28/19,"Promised speeds nearer 50mbs and at the beginning that’s what we received, then the cancellation date passed and speed drops to18mbs. BT first say fault at the exchange, then line outside house now it’s inside the house and a possible £85 charge. Fault promised to be fixed by 26th - now 28th and still poor speed"
D Walsh,Enfield,1/28/19,"BT are an absolute JOKE. Ordered my installation on Jan 5 and was told would be installed on Jan 16. Install was cancelled, and due to ""technical complications"" had to cancel the order and reorder on Jan 12.

That put the date back to Jan 22, but connections got it back to Jan 16. Then was told the installation was cancelled AGAIN.

Was told it would be done on Jan 28, and have now been informed that the engineer WON'T be able to install... AGAIN!

BT are an absolute JOKE.

They're too big and just don't care about their customers. Stick with a smaller supplier who takes care of their customers."
D Patel,Ickenham,1/25/19,Worst company I have ever been with. Firstly they charge me for a whole year of BT sport when I never asked for it. I cancel my package with BT and they send me a final bill charging me for an extra month. They haven't got anything right from day one. Stay away
MK Person,MK,1/24/19,"Reliable - check!
Fast - Nah Nah! I have fibre to the house and pay for 30Mb. Get this sometimes in the evening but during the day only 10Mb. Not technical issue as I get a ping under 10ms."
Trevor,Davis,1/24/19,Terrible customer service. I’ve moved to plusnet. So much better.
Francesca,Ilford,1/23/19,Worse customer service ever. Call them in August to renew the contract..clearly asking them to pay the same amount of money 53.73£ it was monthly. The person on the phone dishonestly told me that the bill was going to be the same and now I have a contract till February 2020 with a bill of 62.99£ for something that I didn’t ask and I didn’t want. When I have called them I was offered a discount of 4£ with a new contract for 6 months ending on August 2020. Totally joke. Can’t wait to leave them for good and not recommended to anybody. Stay away from BT!!!!
John mercer,Oldham,1/23/19,BT broadband is the worst broadband supplier I have ever had. Join BT if you like buffering all the time. We are paying £52 per month foe an appalling service. If we want it checked out we have to agree to pay expenses if they don’t find a fault.
Ryan Hole,Radstock,1/22/19,"The worst service I have ever received!

I was initially sold a package which was at a great price and thought this would be a simple and successful purchase.

I was informed it could take a week to install the broadband, which was not an major issue.

Then I started receiving calls and messages daily from a call centre that barely talked a word of English, and after 9 days realised they were trying to tell me they had to cancel the order and start again. This frustrated me but I allowed it to happen, as I had little choice.

To cut a long story short after 2-3 weeks I was told this had to happen again and it could take up to 3 months for the service to be installed. I simply told them to cancel and I would go elsewhere.

This is not acceptable for this day of age, and I will never attempt to go with BT again!"
Lauren,Northampton,1/21/19,"Absolutely appalling service from BT. Waited 8 weeks to get broadband and tv services, engineers not coming to appointments, no one telling me when engineers due to visit, booked time off work and no one even came. Customer services blaming outreach everytime. 7 hours of calls, 8 weeks of no tv or WiFi in my home. Have gone to virgin AVOID!"
Adrian,Stockport,1/20/19,"I spent 8 months with a fraction of the speed I was supposed to get via Fibre Broadband plsu the hub kept resetting about 6 or 7 times a day.

The help I received was awful, they didnt send a new hub out when they said they would and kept threatening to charge me £130 to look at it.

Bought out the last 6 months of the contract to go back to Virgin just to stop the stress. Only chose BT for cheap sports but its really not worth the hassle"
Fabi,London,1/20/19,"Unable to connect to WiFi on my mobile phone, phoned BT customer service at least 10 times and was told they were sending me a new router which I've never received, on another occasion I was told the fault was reported to the installation team and they will contact me within 2 days, guess what! They never contacted me...."
Chelsie,Suffolk,1/19/19,"No consideration or care for customers. Phone staff say pretty things but have left 2 of my issues unresolved. Blamed me for their mistakes and have left me to pay for a TV package I cant use, due to the wiring. Was told cancelling during the Trial period was successful but am now stuck paying for something I cant use. NO HELP. NO CARE. WORST BROADBAND EXPERIENCE IVE HAD."
Ioana,Newcastle upon Tyne,1/18/19,"Very poor customer service. The cost for my internet increase with ~2-3 pounds every 3 to 4 months, started with 34 pounds and now I have to pay 39,99 pounds! Never again! I will switch as soon as possible. I can’t recommend BT!"
Dave,"Newton Abbot, Devon",1/18/19,Cannot det infinity where i live but upgraded to best package i could get. Supposed to get 13-21 mb download and 8 mb upload but best i get is around 5-7 upload & 1-2 download! If i’m watching bt sports or downloading i cannot even play xbox live without buffering.
Dr Neil,Scotland,1/16/19,"They were very polite and followed script, but the issue was not resolved and I was cut off from chat mid sentence. BT has been charging for a service it has not been able to provide for several months now due to a faulty hub which their own engineer identified and refuses to replace it without going through yet more test on the line - which is fine as the fault is not with the line, but the hub. Still not happy and no chance of repair. The customer I am representing has dementia and Alzheimer's, so you would think that they would prioritise essential services for folk with disabilities, but .... nope. They will not even discuss a refund for the months wasted trying to get the service up and running."
Charlie,Warrington,1/14/19,"Never had any problems with BTs broadband services and the smart hub range is outstanding. I don't get any buffering and the additional free services such as the free Wi-Fi hotspots are really helpful. BT can be a more expensive service but value for money especially in terms of the added free services (Wi-Fi hotspots, cloud storage and virus protect) and the broadbands performance alone makes it worth the couple of quid more you pay. overall great experience. I think a lot of people forget how much they use their broadband and don't give much thought to it other than getting the cheapest deal available. When you've got a household all using the broadband 24/7 and you've decided to pay the least you can for your internet its not surprising when you don't get a quality service."
CEdwards,Kent,1/14/19,"Pretty slow service and high cost, very bad customer service but generally OK. Will switch in the future."
Peter,Huntingdon,1/11/19,"Sometimes it seems like these review forums are just opportunities for people to complain and hardly anyone leaves positive reviews. Well, here is one for a change.

We've been with BT for some years now and, in the past couple of years, our village has been upgraded to fibre. It is disgusting that this has taken so long, compared to other countries like Canada which laid down fibre even to outlying townships a decade ago, but there you are.

Since the fibre upgrade and, obviously, the delivery of a new router, broadband has improved dramatically. Best of all is the responsiveness of the BT helpline. You now get to talk to people in the UK or Ireland and they're pretty knowledgeable. Whenever we've had broadband dropouts a quick call has restored and speeded up the service.

What's more our contract is now coming to an end and I found this site because I was looking for a cheaper deal. It looked like SSE is the only reliable and recommended alternative to BT and I could make a £20 saving monthly by switching.

I rang BT just to find out when my contract was ending and got talking about deals and managed to make that £20 saving by staying with them for another 18 months. I've also saved another £15 a month by switching my mobile account to them.

All in all, I'm happy with the BT performance and my dealings with them. Recommended."
Mr tox,ST HELENS,1/11/19,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Our business has lost thousands in revenue promising us their service after cancelling installation SEVEN times! We were shipped from pillar to post overseas which cost a huge amount in phone costs. unreliable, inefficient; If you can't complete a service then why take it on"
Hafiz,London,1/9/19,"The most unreliable company I have come across in the entire world. The staff members are the dumbest bunch of incompetent fools in the world.

BT has stolen money from me and made promises that they will reimburse me in the next bill but still have not done it.

I have been trying to move my phone line from upstairs to downstairs for four months now and they have made 4 different appointments and did not show up for 2 appointments. They showed up for 2 appointments and were unable to do the job because they are just dump and pathetic.

I have probably spent over 50 hours speaking to them on the phone in the last 4 months. All the BT customer annoyance service assistants on the phone do their utmost best to annoy the **** out of you.

Avoid this company at any cost."
Chris Hill,Farnham,1/9/19,Do not touch BT with a barge pole. They have been happy for me to pay well over the odds fo a long time. £35 over the odds per month to be exact. Guess that's what happens when you don't keep eagle eyes clamped on these comanies all the time! Lesson learned.
Carole,Northampton,1/6/19,Would have given no stars but there wasn’t an option for that..good enough to take your money off you every month because I was in a contract but paid for 11 month of no phone and broadband but won’t give me any compensation because there pathetic excuse was I wasn’t phoning them all the time to report it..I would advise to steer clear of bt don’t want to know when you complain steer clear of them better providers out there who are cheaper and have better customer services bt’s customer services is appalling.
Ivana,Dover,1/5/19,Just the worst internet we ever had. AVOID AVOID AVOID
Wayne,London,1/4/19,I went around the houses to try and arrange broadband with BT as they kept saying my house didn't exist - despite providing them with the name and mobile number of the person that did the survey and the survey reference number. Finally got a date for installation. The engineer turned up after the allocated time (8am-1pm) and said he couldn't do it. Spoke to 8 different people in less than 24 hours - each one telling me something different. Still no broadband.
Sabera Chowdhury,London,1/3/19,"I have landline and fibre broadband with BT. BT's customer and technical service is all mostly handled via overseas call centres, and they just seem to read scenarios off rote, so don't really listen, if they understand your problem at all, so it's a terribly frustrating experience. BT left me without a landline on and off for several months when I moved to a new place until they finally admitted the fault was with them, and eventually rectified it. It took many calls until the problem was taken seriously. Broadband fibre speeds were nowhere near what was advertised, and the service cut out quite often. Once an Openreach engineer came and noticed the wiring on the street was pretty precarious which explained why there had been so many issues. On top of all that, their service is not value for money. I was on a deal originally but I was unwell over a period during which the deal contract came to an end; they don't notify you and then started charging a hefty amount monthly as per their standard tariff, so I ended up overpaying a few hundred pounds, so keep note of your contract periods. I just swallowed it as I knew I would be moving in a few more months so kept things the same as I didn't want to pay an early exit fee if I started another contract. Of course, don't be completely fooled by ""no exit fee"" either on a standard tariff, as they will want 30 days' notice, which is effectively a hidden fee. There are lots of better and cheaper providers out there with much better customer service. BT have lost touch and are sadly not a good provider, consistently. I won't be using them again."
Christopher,Weymouth,1/2/19,"You'll need a good 4G service with BT as the broadband is not very good. BT customer service pointed out that the fast speeds were only for people in the bigger cities. In other areas, we should expect a worse service."
Bruce hillman,Cupar,1/2/19,"My broadband speed is approx 1.5mbp, it’s terrrible the connection drops out and most of the time we can’t get online. We’re stuck with them for another 12 months, and it doesn’t look like anything is about to change. Wished I’d never signed up with BT as they aren’t interested in fixing this connection."
Vitalij,Liverpool,12/31/18,"Unreliable.
When it works, it's ok, but sometimes it dies right at the time you need it and it's very annoying.
It's still better than Sky but nowhere as good as BT was.

Also, another problem with the Internet is that when someone uploads a file, Internet in whole house becomes unusable, so we have to use 3G internet for it instead. Not only does upload make the internet unusable, but it's also very slow and even not very big files take ages to upload!."
Christina,Wrexham,12/30/18,Joined bt back in November my live date was the 30th broadband and landline was dead rang bt and they too me it was a fault on the line I got told numoures dates to go live it didn't happens no end of phone calls complaints still nothing done then Friday 28th Dec and bt customer services rang me admitting their was no fault it was the local supplier for the area who hadn't done the work in the beginning they told me I couldn't switch provider as the fault would still be there I've spoken to no end of call handlers and each one lie threw their teeth this company has the worst customer services I've ever dealt with every time I ring I get told 2 days one week and so on a outside company needs to go in and sort them out do not change to bt
Gareth,Hampshire,12/29/18,I get BT broadband for free and I still don’t want it. Giving one star is to much. BT have the cheek to portray that the average customer rating is three star. I don’t think so. One star is more like it. Keep well away from any BT service unless you want to throw money away and go back to the 1980’s.
Yaqoob,Bradford,12/29/18,"My issue was overcharging, I agreed a price for a 12 month contract but was overcharged and the refund was agreed but I never received the refund. BT signed me up to another contract charged me £80 in equipment fees and wasn’t willing to reimburse me. Very bad experience."
Freddie Cunningham,Oxford,12/28/18,"Been with BT for many years now, consequently the most frustrating years of my life. The Broadband that BT provides is a mess. Exaggerated WiFi speeds / lieing about WiFi Speeds. Every day my WiFi goes down for no reason. BT have brought me closer to ending it all than anything else. If you're reading this. DO NOT BUY BT. DO NOT"
Roy Martin,Southampton,12/28/18,"BT have just upgraded my broadband, during the upgrade there was an accidental break in service. I reported this at about 1700 on 27 December. A smart engineer arrived at 1100 on 28 December and tracked the fault back from the house to the cabinet, including checking the incoming wiring. All was fixed by 1230. First rate service. I also ended up with a SIM card that I didn't need, this was cancelled with a minimum of fuss. Thank you BT"
Jamie,North east England,12/27/18,The worst internet money can buy I think bt has the worst internet quality it constantly turns off won’t connect me and they don’t offer fiber in my area depriving hundreds of people internet a really poor service
steeveyboy64,Leicester,12/26/18,"After getting well and truly sick of BT saying 'there is nothing wrong our end' when failing miserabely to resolve the uk's worst broadband ever, I feel this statement really means 'we are still stealing a lot of money out of your bank account and giving you next to nothing in return despite knowing we are breaking our contract'. Our BB keeps dropping every few minutes, can barely stream anything of which in this day and age is a crime given the legitimate streaming services we pay a lot of money for. Yesterday I did a speed test getting 0.7mb but they are charging me for 50mb (nothing wrong our end then eh). After several phone calls and endless tech walkthroughs they literally said there is nothing more they can do and I have their 'refuse' package until July 2019. It sickens me to the core. We have brand new laptops and phones etc and they ALL drop BB frequently (but nothing wrong our end). They even suggested putting a BB signal booster between the BB router and our laptops of which is approximately 5 feet away in direct view? They even suggested hard wiring our laptops so that we have ethernet cables lying all over the living room floor? They make my blood boil and cannot stomach the name BT never mind all the rubbish they spout. Until the day I draw my last breath I will NEVER EVER have their Fisher price equipment in my house again (no offence Fisher price at least your stuff worked!)"
Chris,Romford,12/24/18,Always slower than what you are paying for. Done with BT.
Michael,Aylesbury,12/24/18,"First off, a one star rating for their reliability and customer service is still an overstatement. We have had issues from the start of joining them and it hasnt got better. The internet is more unreliable than anything, we thought Virgin Media were bad but currently the only thing we can rely on from BT is a lack of help from support and our internet to die. They have come out and replaced our cables as that was apparently the issue but shock horror, we are still suffering and will be without internet in the house over christmas. If you are looking to join BT i would look elsewhere, i think a potato is more reliable.

Back to their support, i contacted them multiple times regarding an issue with the bt app. The first person took 20mins without answering a single question thrn directed me to an ""expert"". Thr expert then didnt have a clue and when i asked a question he couldnt answer, the chat was disconnected. Their customer service is non existant and if the answer isnt on their script they say they will send an engineer out and then say you may be charged if the fault is our end (last i checked this would still be their issue as they installed exerything)

Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs unless they buck their ideas up and change their service completely."
Christopher,,12/21/18,"It's just so bad!
We have the Infinity package which averages 0.78 Mbps when it works (should be >60), but most of the time it's zero. Be wise, go elsewhere for your broadband."
Ammar,Longsight,12/21/18,The most disgusting company in the world
michael lewendon,READING,12/20/18,"Complained to BT about our Broadband constantly dropping out, each time I did this BT advised me to get a better, faster Deal, a new contract. Now we are paying over £50 a quarter. We tried to end our Contract and were advised we had to pay £216 if we pulled out. We still loose connection from time to time and BT say they don't guarantee constant connection. They said, ""Complaining on social media can be effective"" lol check out Facebook posts, EFFECTIVE? Are you kidding? We have been bludgeoned into paying more and more each time we have complained, by telling us to upgrade to this and that, and I'm sure we are not alone? Did this ever happen to YOU? We had an Openreach engineer sent out to our home to fix the fault by BT? Great he found out what was wrong, fixed the problem. All good then? No. The engineer went out to his Openreach Vehicle and filled in his report stating No problems found? WHY? Because BT-Openreach would get away with paying Compensation to Customers if the report states this. BT allowed this, turned a blind eye. Now today if the Engineer finds a fault in your home you have to pay a fee of £75. Is that the same TRUSTED Engineer from OPENREACH sent out by BT? Yes it is.
I've spoken to BT today asking them to change over my account to my wife's name as my health is deteriorating and it would be less stress later on. I have also asked for a lesser cost contract £29.99 for 18 months. As advertised on TV, But they refused.After 50 years being with BT. My Advice to all that want a phone-broadband etc, stay well clear of BT. you will not be disappointed.
michael n Betty lewendon
ps
Were you or your family, or Buisness treated with the same Scam-Con, by BT- Openreach to deny Thousands of Customers Compensation? BT-Openreach must have all the Engineers reports, Was your fault report same as ours? Lies, Ofcom UK media watchdog, have they been informed about this pratice?"
Tom F,Bristol,12/18/18,"Several weeks ago I reported problems with my router, far from the three days as promised on the adverts, I am still waiting. Every time I speak to BT customer service they assure me that they have placed an order for one to be sent, each time I check my order History and nothing has been sent. My complaint has been escalated to the highest level and was given final assurances that my new router has been sent, but the same thing has happened again. Please avoid BT at all costs."
Marko Priimagi,London,12/18/18,"Avoid avoid avoid. Can't believe how disappointed I am. Ordered the service on 29/11. Was supposed to be active 6/12. Nothing happened and I called the customer service. They said the engineer made a mistake and it will be activated 11/12. Nothing happened. Called the customer service and they said the engineer is rescheduled for 16/11. Northing happened. Same stuff happened again and the next ""activation date"" is 19/11. Bt has one job and that is to turn my broadband on. They have failed to do that simple task for 3 weeks now. I would never recommend anyone to change their service to BT."
M Keshta,Epsom Surrey,12/16/18,Unbelievable. Broadband speed is awful. BT don’t guarantee speed of WiFi in my house only wired connection. BT TV hasn’t been working for 3 months. They will only send out an engineer only if I agree to pay £85 if the fault is in my house? Don’t trust them! Poor poor service!! I was with Sky for 10 years. Not one problem. No one.
Hayes,Juniper hill,12/16/18,"Not recommended customer service non existent ,service not fir for purpose. Happy to take 43.00 per month and offer a new package ,for no internet"
Sebastian,Chippenham,12/15/18,Do not use this service. I have been locked in a contract for 24 months now and cant wait to leave. Monthly prices have been upped 4 or 5 times during this time and I now pay almost £50 for a broadband only service. Never again
Adam,London,12/12/18,"The worst service I have ever been in contact with. Booked an installation, took a day off work and no-one turned up. BT told me the engineer came at 3.30pm but I was waiting all day, so basically a lie. I re-booked for another day and called BT twice to make sure they would come, they told me on both occasions that someone would definitely attend this afternoon. Called them a third time and BT said that the appointment was changed for the next day, without bloody telling me. I cancelled straight away, I am not paying some muggy company my hard earned cash even and this is even before the initial installations."
AGW,Lincoln,12/10/18,"LN12DF, Paid for 60mb-80mb Broadband but actually receiving constant 29.3-29.5mb, and there has been no Dial Tone since Friday on landline!. This is paid for BT Broadband Super Fast Fibre II: and this a breach of contract since Friday 07/12/2018. Hope anyone working for the Telecom Regulators, Ofcom read this. Now on telephone line: 0800 800 150 and usual BS about sending out an engineer and a callout FEE. Same script different day."
Alan,manchester,12/10/18,crap sevicie for cusmomore support
Joanna,Manchester,12/10/18,"I have been having issues with the router since mid October, contacted BT on numerous occassions, speaking most of the time to rude staff who were sending me instructions for hub 5 or smart hub while I have got hub 4! They were aware as they had asked before. Asking me to split connection, etc. Ended up with having 3 engineers who ordered new hub for me. It didn't arrive so I contacted them, they don't know anything about it! Once it arrived, the speed has dropped so complained again, then they sent me some texts and asked to reply what would cost me extra money. In addition, on one occassion I asked when my broadband contract would expire, lady told me the 4th of January. I rang them at the beginning of December to cancel, I was told that line rental contract expires on that day, broadband contract in July. So lazy! Honestly, I'm fuming, never had such bad issues with Sky or Virgin. I can't wait the contract to be finished!"
uhkoi,hampshire,12/10/18,"I though Virgin media was bad but god damn ! BT sucksssssss just like the guy below stated no BT internet and its been 3 weeks that the board band box arrived.
Called emailed chatted about 10-15 times to only get a email of a manger who said ''To help with your query please call BT on : 0800 800 150.

Kim,Edinburgh,12/7/18,"Annoyed that BT do hard credit searches when your just enquiring about the date/ cost of broadband and don’t go through with the order.

They should let you know"
david,Surrey,12/5/18,
JZ,London Croydon,12/5/18,"If you plan switching to BT, beware they would cut your existing broadband service on Friday morning and leave you whole weekend and bank holiday without Internet connection - which has happened to me. And they won't give you any compensation either. What they boasted ""Switching today, connected tomorrow"" is totally ******** and lie. BE CAREFUL!!!"
Nick,Slough,12/3/18,"They are FULL OF ****.
Besides the fact that they actually have speed drops constantly, their internet crashes on a weekly basis, super expensive and ling their asses off.
On their superfiber page they lie about Virgin Media which was the best and fastest internet provider in UK for a long time and they will be the best stil."
sam,dartford,12/3/18,"I bought a BT broadband in 2016 and then renewd on 17.In 2018 when i was getting a problem with their speed download/upload speed and worst customer service experience ever i had in life, decide to change my provider spoken to BT few times about my last day of ending contract and so on. after switching provider (in process)after few days later received an email from BT stating that i need to pay £86 for cancallation fee due to i am in contract with them till 2019. So i contacted BT customer service lady doesn't know what she is talking about and all the time TRYING to selling me BT package in a different ways. which i said NO for any package after waiting 45 min over the phone, customer service lady mentioned me i had renew my contract in arpil 18 for next 12 month contract. which i was completely disagreed with her as why would i will buy a new contract when i am already in contract and new contract is more expensive then old contract thirdly i had not received any emails or notifcation that about new contract or switching to new contract.
I also mentioned about previous conversation with BT customer service agent which they had confirmed me my last date of ending contract in nov 18.
Honeslty after spending 3 weeks talking to them its feel like on these customer service is Dumb, and stupid which doesn't understand as well as no communication with each other.
IF this case not resolve here i will take it to MANAGING DIRECTOR and THEN COURT.
Piss taker BT. Stay away from these morons."
STEVE,,12/3/18,"Following resetting of an e-mail password by an Indian call centre techie my e-mail stopped working. A quick call to 150 got me to Ireland where I was fed a line of utter BS yet promised a call back by an expert at a set time.

The duly appointed time came and went and was exceeded by two hours when a call mysteriously came through on my mobile - which I wasn't expecting. Unfortunately the call rang out. Ringing 150 again I was told that there was nothing that could be done, India would ring me again when they were able, they could not define a fixed time. Realising I was beaten, I hung up, did a quick internet search to find out how to complain.

Yet another phone number and another wait for 15 mins for it to be answered by an abrasive woman from the ""Billing"" team who couldn't help me and was totally disinterested. When I asked why a member of Billing was answering a complaint call I was told we ALL answer complaints. It's nice to know that your complaint call is not going to a dedicated team but just some disinterested staff member who couldn't give a toss quite safely with no redress. I was told that things were the way they were and I would have to wait. The reason I was contacted by my associated mobile was because there was a fault with my landline - curious that - as I was talking to the hapless BT Billing bint by..... the supposedly faulty landline!!!!!!!

Well, I am still waiting but I haven't been idle. After 20 years of being a loyal BT customer and after three abortive, painful and stilted calls with Indian customer service within that time period, I have finally had enough. I will be swapping to Plus Net who curiously enough despite their BT links offer a 30% cheaper equivalent package with call and tech support centres in .... Sheffield and Leeds and with an award winning customer service group to boot..

My opinion of BT is that it doesn't matter how long you have been with them, customer loyalty counts for nothing, they just don't give a ****... and are an unmitigated, 24 karat shower of utter ordure and that is being polite.

My advice, is to other disaffected customers is to vote with your feet and secure a better service at a more competitive price. - just like me."
Ryan Jones,Swansea,12/2/18,"Worst internet I’ve ever experienced in my life.
Slowest speeds, disconnecting constantly, the worst customer service, engineers seem to continually miss appointments and they give you, wait for it a whole ..... £10 as compensation!! Not like I’ve taken days off unpaid to sit and wait for them not to turn up so £10 doesn’t really come close!
I’m moving in 6 days time and can not wait to never ever have to hear the name BT ever again!
I’m paying for fibre optic broadband and get a whole 4 mb download speed, IF IM LUCKY.
I can not describe how angry it makes me when I’m half way through a game or watching a film and boom it’s gone.
Do yourselves a favour, never go near BT for anything, EVER."
Del murphy,Kent countryside,12/1/18,BT are rubbish. Decided to use two cans and some string. Send message by pigeon was much faster . Don't call them for advise as will bring out a side of you you did not know was in you. I turned into a monster because they are robot's spuying out pointless tech advise you have tried before you called them .charge you a fortune to tell you to switch it off and on again.
mark omalley,MIDLOTHIAN,12/1/18,"the greed is pathetic.went from £29 to£58 after 18 months.I don't know why they treat you as a mug while giving new customers a great deal.anyhow have switched to talk talk for £20.its up to us to leave after 1st contract ends.its dead easy,your new supplier does all the work"
Roxzan,Taunton,11/30/18,"Get pushed from pillar to post, don't actually get factual answers, rude customer services, and now ain't even answering the phone, internet issues for nearly a week now. Been on phone for half hour and pay £44 for the previlege. Not a happy customer sort it out."
Des,Silverstone,11/30/18,"This company is shocking I moved into my new home and gave 2 weeks notice to BT that I was moving. I spoke to home move team who explained I will be getting my hub posted and a engineer was booked also, I was happy with that set up.

On the day of the new hub arriving I rang to find out what time they were turning up. This is where the problems started. I was calling the customers services team they did not recognise i had moved and could not find the information regarding any engineers or Wi-Fi hub being sent then they cut me off.

I rang again and that person also said the same thing. I called up a 3rd time and they found my details without any problems? I was then told I would have to wait, 3 more weeks with no phone, WiFi or TV.

I made a complaint 1 week ago but have heard nothing back from them. They are the worse company I have dealt with, they lie and tell you stuff that is not true. The funny thing I have texts and email confirming it all.

I have no choice but to use these jokers I will be emailing the onbusman, and telling everyone because they want to ignore me."
Michelle rainey,Northern iteland,11/29/18,
Antony Jones,Shavington Crewe,11/27/18,
Eileen,London,11/26/18,Terrible customer service. Needed to switch to a new account after other flatmate moved out but we were already using BT. They had no problem turning off our broadband but haven't set up a new connection. Get fobbed off every time I call with no one taking action or accountability to see our problem to resolution. I have to call every time and explain the problem and then get connected through to a different person where I have to explain again. Would never have gone with them if I had read the reviews first.
Christopher,DORSET,11/25/18,"This is a terrible service. Slow speed, dropouts, OMG this is so bad.
Do not sign up with these guys."
Andy Gray,Ayr,11/23/18,Worst experience of my whole business career. I don’t want to go into deatil as I simply don’t want to waste anymore time. Ended up costing my company thousands. Find another supplier for business phone and broadband.
Scorpio,Croydon,11/23/18,Absolutely disgusted with BT! Have cancelled service within 14day cooling off period because they have failed to instal my new phone line and broadband on 2 occasions and failed to send engineer despite promising a visit todaySpent hours and talked to many agents on phone to no avail so have cancelled the service.BT are utter rubbish and I advise you to avoid them like the plague!
Paul Camp,cuffley,11/23/18,Fixed price contract is very expensive compared to current deals Nil response from customer service
Ben,Smith,11/22/18,"Ridiculous WiFi, slow speeds paying for 50 barely getting 10mb/s , poor connection issues, says it’s connected but no internet , download speeds are better in potato than their hubs and you’d get better customer service from a lamppost than one of their staff keeping you on hold through till your mid 20’s"
e o trgay,london,11/21/18,horrible customer service. kept me at home all day just to inform me that the engineer has postponed the visit to tomorrow on his own! while the system still gave today's date and sent confirmations on the arrival of the engineer. customer service has no idea and just apologizes. worst provider ever. don't even think of trusting BT. they will screw you over their monopoly position over and over.
Thomas,Yorkshire,11/21/18,I've never left a review for a company before so I think that says enough. I would advise anyone to leave BT alone. Absolute crooks. Increase the price whenever they choose. Always make everything in their favour. They charge you for everything. Tell you that you can't cancel till they say pretty much even though they know my internet is faulty. The TV service is dreadful and about 20 years behind sky. When you phone you'll be passed around departments for fun. Please avoid them. Price started at £45 a month then shortly into my contract they upped it to £53 because they can! Oh and we had a month of trouble 18 months ago with the 4k box as well. Will not miss them. Got to wait another month till I'm free. Never again will I gone with BT.
Jacob Nulli,London,11/19/18,
Liam,Carlisle,11/19/18,"The worst provider I've ever been with. The connection always goes down, is ridiculously slower than what I was told I would get when it does work, and they were 2 weeks late installing it. Couldn't hate a company more!"
Matt99,UK Swindon,11/17/18,"I have been a bt customer for 3 years, my contract is for 42mb/sec I get about 4mb/sec tops! @£29pcm if your a day late in paying which happens to me a lot as I'm on benifets you get disconnected which includes a charge of £12.99! 5his months bill was £41.98, I spoke 5o a lovely woman in India who was quite helpfull but not overly so. BT is a terrible broadband provider when it comes to the money grabing scheme, as for the actual broadband its slow at best depending on the server your connected to, for example if your watching the YouTube it's slow to the point that 6our video will start and stick to a very low quality like 480p until you manually up it to 1080p, general Internet page searching is not fast like pre 1mb speeds however if connecting to a Microsoft server for xbox I get a good deal 40 odd mb/sec which is great. You can have all this for a mer 29 quid per month. I will not be updating my contract this time and can not recommend at all."
Richard,Kent,11/15/18,"BT has the worse customer service iv ever dealt with, i was happy till i moved in february 2018 and i was a fibre customer, they put me on slow internet speed and didn't tell me and made me a new contract which i couldn't get out of at the time, when they claimed to put me on fibre my download speeds dropped more than the slow speed one i was getting, so after months with poor customer service and arguing i told them where to go with there broadband, i was also a mobile customer and with out my say so they claimed i said yes to cancel my mobile deals so when i was cut off i called them for 3 days trying to get the pac code so i can keep my number, cause the sims where cut off they can not generate a pac code, they may speak english but they dont understand english, i will never use them again, and i advice anyone else to go else where and save yourself the agro."
EK,East Anglia,11/14/18,"In the last 6 months the broadband service we receive has been unreliable ranging from 2Mbps - 6Mbps. For a week we did actually get speeds of around 15Mbps, so it is really hard to understand why the service is so very poor for the majority of the time. I'm switching from BT as my Demon Internet is much more reliable."
Lorelle,Leeds,11/14/18,"I won’t bore you with the story. However take the advice and do join another provider. Even though BT are a very large company they are clearly going through some serious money issues. The service is shocking and never worked properly. They will over charge you and make it near impossible for you to get your money back. Don’t be suckered in by the introductory offer, you will be better off paying more else where and the price being fixed however still receiving good full working service. BT customer service is pathetic. Again they have cut costs with over seas call centres reducing the customer service levels."
Shel,Newmarket,11/13/18,"I've put one star because there is no option for 0.
I am a new BT customer and have been plagued with lack of service, poor customer care and incorrect billing. The time spent trying to sort this out has cost me far more than any prospective savings from lower bills for the 18 month contract period and I wish I never switched.
It took BT over a month to connect me from the first visit.In that time BT closed tickets telling me the problem was solved yet I did not have the service I was being charged for. Just as I finally get sent an engineer that knew what he was doing and does connect me, I am incorrectly charged £130 for the engineer visit. This fee is only meant to apply where the fault is with the customer (either on their property or with their equipment). This was not the case with me and I was told by the engineer that the fault was further down the line.
I do not like the way BT assume the customer is in the wrong at every step of the way. I am complaining to get the matter rectified, but I bet there are many people who do not understand what they are being charged for and just pay the money. This has been a terrible customer journey. I do not only NOT RECOMMEND, I would actively say GO ANYWHERE ELSE!"
Peter,Manchester,11/13/18,"Multiple week delays on installation leaving me without internet for a period despite having left a generous overlap with my previous provider (Hyperoptic). Thankfully hyperoptic were able to extend my previous package without issue to cover this. My new BT internet cuts out on a regular basis. Speeds slower than previous provider. Signed up in April, 2 months later they raised my package price by 15%. Apparently I missed a letter and have now cannot dispute this. Customer service unhelpful, generally unable to answer simple questions. Very unimpressed, service with other providers has been far better."
Julia Burgis,Bournemouth,11/12/18,Absolutly disgusted with bt I'm a new broadband customer and my service was supposed to have been activated last Tuesday today a week later still no broadband.After numerous heated conversations and a visit from an engineer I still have no broadband.I have now been told another engineer will be out on Monday..Nobody seems to know what they are doing it's a wonder they have any customers if this is how they treat a new one . I will be cancelling my contract that hasn't even started. You have been warned
Kate,Cresselly,11/10/18,
Dave,Buckinghamshire,11/8/18,"Shocking service, router broke Monday and still waiting for a replacement Thursday. Probably have to switch to Sky."
rigamortice,scotland,11/6/18,My advice is to find a different supplier BT is awful & their costomer service is even worse
Cornes,Newport,11/6/18,Speed is to low for consistent performance
Matthew Edwards,Wrexham,11/4/18,"Been with bt for 7 years since fibre was available in my area, I’ve got the fibre 2 package which the speeds were up until couple of weeks ago at near max 67mb, then after noticing speed was down to 45mb so I got in touch with them was told by a guy from bt that he sees the problem bangs on his keyboard for couple of mins then says give it 48 hours and it should be back to how it was, 48 hours later still the same so I get back in touch with them another guy goes through the same dummy steps and says that he’s put it on record and they will look into it, week later still the same so ring them again and explain it woman says it could be the hub so she will send one out could take 3 days to come, 3 days later no hub so get in touch with them again have to go through all the problems again with them even tho it was supposed to be on record so I wouldn’t have to explain! Anyway woman from bt says there is nothing down saying a hub was sent out and she is processing it now to get one out asap so couple days later hub arrives set it up try speed tests and it’s the same, so ring bt back up fella tells me that my speed is just over the minimum 46mb that was agreed with the contract, I try telling him that for all these years it was at max so we got the more expensive fibre 2 package now over time it’s gone down to a speed where a cheaper package would of right for us, But I hate the fact that over these years the internet price has gone up but the speed has gone down, he blamed my neighbors or closer to the exchange etc even Openreach were to blame!! Owned by bt I may add, anyway we agreed to it in contract so it’s tough poo!? Shocking company avoid peeps."
Paul Mortlock,Bournemouth,11/4/18,BT broadband is terrible. My phone works faster on 4G. Keep well away.
Joe,Bedfordshire,11/3/18,You will spend just as much time bwing without internet as you will with internet. Every other month you will have a full 2-3 weeks of constant disconnections which wont allow you to get anything done.
Unhappy customer,London,11/1/18,Very poor. Unreliable more time spent trying to get reconnected. Do not bother
Brev,"Hook, Hampshire",10/31/18,"Easy to renew contract for phone and broadband. Broadband speed quoted as minimum of 53 mbps but getting only 30. Router log shows internet connection dropping out betweeb 20 and 40 times per day, generally during busy periods. Definitely not getting value for £55 per month. Telephone on same line having no problem."
Jeremy Hodgson,Chiswick,10/31/18,On my Dads death I took over the BT broadband account only to discover BT were ripping him off over £80 for the basic broadband service. I relayed my utter contempt and disgust and camcelled the service. Do not use BT or deal with this company is my recommendation.
Mark,Newport,10/26/18,"After ordering bt broadband as i was trying to move from virgin i realised the broadband was no good as i need a fixed ip address and that bt provided revolving ip addresses.

I used the broadband 2-3 times just to set it up but as didn't start using it until 2 days after the 14 day cancellation they said i owe them around £400 to cancel.

Absolutely ridiculous amount of money for a service i only used to set it up. now they have passed the debt to a collection agency and added 25% so it is now £565.66.

i told them numerous times on the phone the service was unusable to me because the ip address was not static. if they had made this clear upfront i would never have ordered but doing so would probably mean less customers so the details were hidden away.

I sent all the equipment back with 7 days but they then added an equipment charge on top. I used the broadband to set up 1 pc and never used the phone line at all.

how can such a company that prides itself on being a family operator be such an aggressive, venal predator?

At some point there will be a debt collector at my door to take my possessions. all because i went 2 days over the 14 days because it was not straight-forward to switch from virgin to bt as i run a home office.

THIS COMPANY IS A DISGRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Christopher,Weymouth,10/26/18,"Terrible broadband service. Does not work very well, should have checked the small print.... apparently :-("
DPJ,Grimsby,10/25/18,Extremely poor signal. Keeps going in and out. Shockingly bad!!
Paulo,London,10/25/18,"Internet and phone including, for my own experience is just totally wasting of money, I regretted make the contract start at £31 and after got into £34. Don’t make contracts or deals with bt, customers services just crap and unprofessionals , unproductive. The services they provide not value and I’m sure you can find cheaper and better . They are very manipulative without having a clear payment at the end of the monthly also they don’t informed you about the prices going up."
Christopher,Weymouth,10/24/18,Continually bad broadband service. BT told me that there are too many people connecting to the broadband service in the local area at the same time! Apparently this is not their problem! Awful people.
Callum James,Northampton,10/24/18,"Absolutely terrible.

Ordered BT package on the 18th September, chased multiple times to confirm appointments as they had missed two visits. Had phone confirmation, email confirmation and yet they still don't turn up. Now being told 2nd November at the earliest. Still no service then after 6 weeks of ordering. Would not recommend BT to anyone."
Halil,Devon,10/23/18,Well what can i say you see the all reviews 1 star to much for this company i sell my shop transfer the new owner they still wants £800 termination fee no fare
amrik,WALSALL,10/22/18,"BT is a totally unethical company. They hike the price and send a single email giving you 30 days and the email is not clear that the price is going up and you can cancel the contract without any penalties. You only find out once the direct debit goes through showing the higher price. Price hike is more that 15%. I will not be using BT ever again once my contract runs out early next year. When I extended my contact last December it said renew and your price will not increase, be careful as this is not true because any ""general"" BT price hike can still be passed on to you, so not worth the paper it is written on. Do not trust BT at all."
Callum Boot,Torquay,10/21/18,"My family has been paying £50 for fibre for the last 6 months. We are getting 50% packet loss and our speed is less than standard broadband. In a futile attempt to ask them to fix it, we had them cut us off on the phone twice and haven’t tried to contact us since. I sent them an email 3 weeks ago with no reply."
Liam,Wrightington,10/21/18,"Hidden charges if you cancel early. called to see how much it would cost to end the contract and they told me £15, the bill came and it was an extra £70 - not trustworthy"
Ben,London,10/19/18,"Customer service appalling
One of the most expensive out there but extremely bad service takes over three weeks just for the engineer to come out and connect
Once connected always problems"
Techy_G,Bristol,10/18/18,"Was tricked out of switching - BT agreed monthly to match an equal competitor - they reneged 4mths in..just counting 6 months left of contract so BT can be excluded from my future...
BT lost a good customer - they just don't know yet :-D

Well done loyalty team ;-)"
bruja,Uk,10/18/18,"Ridiculous customer service, any given time of the day, any given time of the year. Their broadband diconnects pretty much regularly without any mistakes from our side and when a customer service representative is being asked about any failures they ask “how are we to know what’s going on?”

Their internet is good enough, speed and reach wise but it’s just not worth it. For all the hassle you get more hassle. Main issue is the customer service. Clearly a company that’s only looking to make a quick pound."
Alicia,Hampshire,10/17/18,Haven’t even had broadband from them. Signed up over two weeks ago. Got told I would be connected and have internet by 12am on the 12/10 (over a week after I signed up). Engineer turned up and “sorted” everything. 13/10 and no internet. Get an email saying I’d have internet by 23/10. Both my partner and myself rely on the internet for work. I called them and the person I spoke to advised there was an issue with the exchange and said she has spoken to the engineer manager and manages to pull it forward to the 18/10. Got a text message 17/10 saying it would be the 23/10 again. Called and was advised they could not get an engineer out and I would have to wait for the original date. They will not compensate for the money my partner and I have lost in wages due to having no internet as we are not commercial customers. Called Virgin Media and they said they would send router out and would have internet in TWO DAYS. No engineer required. Never been more angry in my life.
Cade,Clitheroe,10/17/18,"the worst isp we've ever been with. currently getting speeds of approx 0.5mb/s and 600ms ping. called the customer service several times, they have been no help. lost cause of a service. also it became apparent that when we bought fibre optic and they installed it, they were supposed to install a new splitter for the phone/internet line but they left us with an old outdated one. outstanding."
Jackie,Kings Lynn,10/15/18,
Metin,Southend,10/14/18,"Absolutely ridiculous service. I have been with BT for years. Recently I decided to change providers because the cost of their service is just ridiculous in comparison to other similar services. After switching provider to the Post Office I received a call from a BT customer support agent. The agent promised me a reduced price at £20 and included a £50 gift voucher to keep me to stay. After 3 months, still no sign of the gift voucher and emails about it ignored. The price has gone up to £24 without any warning. Avoid at all costs."
Salar,Burton on Trent,10/13/18,
Christopher,Dorset,10/13/18,"It's so bad. For years it has droped out, slows down and just does not work. We have been with BT for years, it's been really bad for the last five. The support team exists, but they are experts on sending people on a wild goose. We must have spent weeks on the phone with them over the years. Unfortunately, if you leave, you lose your email addresses. So it feels like a bit of a trap. I would advise anybody to avoid if you can, there are much better and more reliable providers for the money."
Yoana,York,10/13/18,"Very disappointed. Raised our price after a yer from 33 to 54 quid, this is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. By reading more and more reviews I see that that seems to be the problem with everyone all the time. They value drawing in customers and screwing them over and you better be sure as hell that I am NOT coming back to them ever again. You can catch me at TalkTalk getting higher speed, reliability AND lower prices. We're paying for what exactly with BT? Most of the times I'd have my connection drop, their customer service is NO WHERE TO BE FOUND and they screw you over without even notification, an email maybe like HEY dudes, we're gonna raise your internet price with 21 quid now? Naaaah... who gives a crap about the customers themselves right?"
Sonia,Chigwell,10/13/18,I am very unhappy with BT. I have had many problems since joining the latest today is my new expensive iPhone charge is not working after a few weeks of having the phone and Bt said even under warranty they will not replace it very disappointed
Darren,Worcestershire,10/13/18,The hours i have spent on the phone to this company is beyond belief. AVOID in the end switched to XNL for business very professional and great communications and they answer the phone within 5 seconds. Should the big wigs be brought in front of a parliamentary committee and drilled about why they are providing a unacceptable service!
Gillian stevens,Murton,10/12/18,Absolutely amazing service had no internet since yesterday the bloke came out today to fix it even though we have gale force winds and rain he came 10am and it wosint sorted till about 4pm bless him he'd been out in it all day customer service was amazing too thank you so much BT
Kay,Oxford,10/11/18,
R B,Congleton,10/10/18,Been with BT for over 25 years and the price increased to over £75 pm. They wouldn't budge on price so I switched. Best thing I ever did. My broadband speed has increased from 13mbps to 21mbps even though I'm on the minimum speed (and I was paying for a premium broadband speed from BT). Cost is less than 50% of what I was paying previously.
Frane,Reading,10/7/18,"I bought a 5-day wifi from them thinking that I will be able to connect from home. Although I live in Reading near the centre, there was no signal, not even close.
So I called customer support to cancel it and get the refund. They said they can't do it and I need to do it online.
I've managed to cancel this wifi online without using it at all, but never got the refund from BT. Poor."
John,North East,10/5/18,Absolutely terrible customer services! They are billing me more that my contracted sum and cannot get anyone from customer services to resolve the matter. BT clearly do not value their customers and from my experience are totally incompetent at dealing with customer services issues.
Sally,London,10/4/18,"Absoloute crap. Never had anything like it. Says it is connected but that is horse****.drops out every five minutes, requiring you to sign completely back in.wont load anything.wont let you send or receive your ******* messages. And I’m paying over £90 for this ****. Would never recommend. EVER."
Rimah,,10/3/18,
James,Church fenton,10/2/18,"I cannot put into words how bad BT are. I can safely say that they are the WORSE company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.
There staff are poorly informed poorly trained and they even cut me off when they couldn't sort the issues. I swapped to a business line as they told me i would get a better broadband connection.. only thing thing they are good at is billing you. They swapped my line to business and kept billing me for residential too. 10 months being charged double..
This company needs a serious overall. If i could put a minus score i would. If anyone out there could avoid using BT i would higly recommend it.
Complete utter wasters. Service rubbish customer service rubbish."
Orla,London,10/2/18,If I could put no stars I would. Ive just never been through something like this in 2018 I cant get the speed higher than 2mbs and I've called them 5 times to try and sort it and apparently the fault has never gone through. They're totally unreliable. Im paying 45 gbp a month for practically no internet and no one has managed to successfully put my fault through to open reach. An absolute incompetent provider. I wish I could move!
Derek,Morayshire,9/30/18,As soon as the contract is over with BT I will never ever use them again for anything at all. Can not say enough about how f****** awful they are. Broadband speed is okay but reliability is beyond a joke!!! I had better connections when you used to have to dial your phone line to get connected to Internet. I cannot stress enough to everyone around reading this too not go near BT! Every time I try and I mean try to get a reason or figure out why our internet doesn’t work most of the time every time the response I get is try plugging it in and out. Absolutely ridiculous! Final straw was I tried to use the online chat service and after them asking for my details several times through three different folk they ended up cutting us off! I am appalled that people still use these shower of cons
Someone,,9/30/18,
Shannon,Burgess Hill,9/29/18,"There is a lack of communication between BT and me. My broadband package expired this September, but BT doesn't contact me to inform this and charged £20 extra this month. It was ridiculous to pay £63.49 to pay for the broadband package?!
I complained about this issue over the phone, one staff advised me to continue working with BT and was able to offer me £36.99 for the broadband and line. I ended the call as I wanted to have a conversation with my partners but was not told the price would be different next time! I called in twice afterward and was offered £37.99 and £39.99. Everytime I called in and ended up with disppointment and the problem couldn't be solved at all. I am so disppointent with the service and price offered. It is defiitely a wrong choice to work with BT and it lets me down all the time!!! Never come back again!"
Christopher,Dorset,9/29/18,"Just terrible. Have been with BT for over twenty years, the broadband has been really bad over the last five years or so.
Stuttering movies, drop outs and terrible customer service."
Louise,Pontefract,9/29/18,I cancelled because of the many price rises and when your tied into a contract there's little you can do. The service was relatively good but did go off on many occasions. Absloutley discusted with them. We cancelled well with the 30 notice and they decide that they are going to charge us for the next month and once the final bill is generated then they will refund us...after 7-10 days. Be different if we owed them. Waffle on about the terms and conditions but where's the consideration. Just out to Rob your money so glad I cancelled. Been passed about departments for an hour minutes absloute rubbish!!!!
Darren,Strensham,9/28/18,"OK where to start.
Spoke to sale person on Wednesday 19th September at 11.30 am. We ordered Business broadband with 4g assure we went with the 4g assure package because we run a ecommerce business and needed internet access before our line was installed. The sales person promised me the router would be delivered first thing Thursday morning. i was initially impressed. Thursday came and went no router Friday came and went no router i thought it must be delivered Saturday you guessed it no router Saturday.

Monday morning 24th September great router delivered
Plugged it all in no 4g assure working (we have a strong 4g signal in our unit)
50 phone calls later, now Wednesday 26th was promised by a person high up in BT another router would be delivered the next working day.

Thursday 27th no router
Friday 28th Royal mail have been and no router.
Final straw i phoned and cancelled

synopsis
over 50 telephone calls hours of my time wasted
very frustrated

if i could give zero star i would
Trying to get hold of someone in BT now to claim compensation guess that will be another 50 calls"
David,Somerset,9/27/18,"I am a company, we contacted BT to connect a new line and broadband.
the engineer arrived on the monday as planned, but did not install a new line, I was told a survey for an extra cable was needed, this I was told would be within 48 hours and my new line would be fitted by the end of that week.
after no response and calls I finally get told the survey would not happen until nearly two weeks later and the line installation a date could not be given.
So we are moving in to an office with nice new computers, desks and chairs,,, even a nice coffee machine, but no telephones or broadband! We are a service company, with no telephones!!!
BT you are without a doubt the most pathetic organisation I have had the misfortune to deal with. The Legal case stars now!!"
Muhammad,Ilford,9/27/18,I wish there was an option of 0 star. Worst customer services. Charges are 2 X more than Voda and speed is also half. Can wait to get rid of them....
Laura,Gloucestershire,9/27/18,We moved and needing reconnecting. The date we will given didn’t go ahead and had to wait another week. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The staff really don’t care and don’t want to deal with you. I wish we didn’t sign up again and will be looking at leaving them in the future. Be aware people they take your money and don’t do what they say they will.
Richard,kent,9/25/18,
Cengiz,London,9/22/18,"I have gone to the BT web site. Entered my postcode and ordered the fastest broadband+TV package available. The technician has visited in 4 days to install (This is unbelievable right? 4 days only. What an improvement!)
He told me that the line can't support such high speeds so I need to cancel the order and get another package. I have called BT Support, it took 2-3 days to cancel the existing package and they told me that they will order internally for the new one. They ordered the same old package with activation date 15 days ahead. Guys are this a joke?!! Compared to international standards (I can get a broadband in 1 day in any country other than Europe) this is not only silly, it is a rotten service standard. Why the hell everyone has to wait for lazy Open Reach bustards for 15 days to get a connection? Get lost."
Liberty Keyse,Witham,9/20/18,"I moved into a brand new development mid July and received confirmation that I could place an order for broadband on the 31st July. I called as soon as I had the confirmation to place the order the same day. I was assured that once the hub had arrived, I needed to follow the instructions and that I should have a full working service by 3rd August. The 3rd August comes around and the hub had a steady amber light which indicates an Internet problem. I followed the troubleshooting instructions which sent a signal to BT telling them there was an issue. I received a text message the next day 4th August telling me they needed to book an engineer to attend the property and the earliest time they could do this was the 15th August. Due to the nature of my job, I am unable to take time off for scenarios like these and therefore my mother attended the property for me. The gentlemen told my mother that he couldn’t fix the problem and gave us a code which I had to relay to the BT complaints team. It turns out that Openreach had wired up the lines externally incorrectly and another engineer needed to attend to fix the lines. The earliest they could do it was exactly a week later. Wednesday comes around, the day the engineer is coming to repair the lines and the day I was promised for the 3rd time that I’d have a working connection . I receive a telephone call to say unfortunately they were unable to carry out the works and they can’t give me an indication of when it will be fixed. During this period, I’d racked up a large mobile phone bill due to data upgrades that I really needed as I was exchanging emails from the site team of the development regarding to snagging lists and meetings as well as trying to set up the other utility bills in the house. I expressed to BT that I’d had to add on this extra data due to the circumstances I have noted above. A gentlemen told me not to worry and that I would be refunded and all I needed to do was send them a copy of my mobile phone invoice. I called the day before the engineer was supposed to arrive the first time just to double check the times and also to reconfirm what was said to me regarding the data refund. The women had no idea what I was talking about and said that BT do not under any circumstances offer this kind of compensation. She opened a complaint and told me that they would look back through the pre-recorded telephone conversation and would get someone from the complaints team to call me back with a resolution to this problem. This did not happen. I was not actually offered any kind of compensation until the phone call I received from the young lad who had to tell me the engineers couldn’t fix the telephone lines. Even then, all I was offered was £50.00 credit on our account which didn’t even cover the cost of the data upgrades anyway. Any how, I get home the night of the telephone line scenario and the broadband was working. I sat there confused as to why they phoned me to tell me that the service wasn’t fixed and wouldn’t be for some time.. I tried to call to let them know the service was fixed but I never managed to get through to anybody. I had a holiday booked for the 27th August which they was aware of. Whilst I was away, I was inundated with emails telling me I still had no broadband and they didn’t know when it would be fixed. I decided to ignore these numerous messages as I was on my holiday. When I returned the broadband was working so I made another 2 phone calls and an email to tell them the service is working. A week later at 7:30am I received a phone call from an engineer who was outside my property telling me he was here to install my broadband. I had absolutely no knowledge that any visit was booked to install any broadband? I’d called them a week earlier and told them it was working.. I had to turn the engineer away and filed another complaint for the lack of communication. I come home today and the broadband hub is a steady amber light meaning there’s a problem with the connection. Just when I finally thought that the situation had been put to bed, the monster comes out the closet and here we are again waiting for an engineer to come to my property and tell me they can’t fix it again and they don’t know when it will be fixed. Here’s to another racked up phone bill which I will have to pay and a sky cinema package which is totally useless. Here’s to more emails between myself and BT and more broken promises. If I had the choice to take my service elsewhere, I would but unfortunately due to the type of internet that I can have in my property due to an arrangement between BT and the building company, I have no choice but to hand money over to company that cannot even provide a service. Nothing but stress and aggravation since the day I placed the order. Gutting."
Mario,Purfleet,9/20/18,"Terrible costumer service with poor broadband network provided i have 4g network on phone faster then their cable connection dint get any help from-the operators are just passing my call from one to other put on hold and then close the call.
They charged 30£+ extra a month at the end of contract refusing to give any money back or offer you a deal.
What BT are doing is lure good deal with new costumers and as soon are hooking you on contract they just ignore you but are very good on charge extras.
For the peace of mind stay away from them unless like me you had no other options as they run all lines
One star ratings is too much for them."
customer 123,Manchester,9/19/18,"not sure why there are so many negative reviews; we have had BT broadband/phone for 11 months now; never had any problems, fast speed (usually around 50 MBps - as 'promised') reliable landline - only reason we're (probably) going to change is that the initial 12 months discount expires... and now things get really expensive :("
Kate,Histon,9/19/18,"My first experience with BT Broadband, which was a quick fix for my VOIP requirement, is that the engineer didn't even turn up and I have to wait three more days for an update. Rubbish!"
A,Manchester,9/19/18,"Strongly not recommending BT!!!
BT Breached all codes of practices and they simply don’t care!
Charging for the speed of 67 MB, delivering a speed below 11MB, insisting to get me paying full contract of 18 months even though their emails says I had to pay only for the service I have received!!! Ignoring my calls and emails even on social media so the 14 days would pass so you would have to pay the termination fees!!!
No matter how many years you have been a loyal customer, Just Wait till you have a problem and this is when they all get very rude to you starting from advisers up till managers!!!"
Michael,Suffolk,9/18/18,"Diabolical customer service. They frequently fail to call back even when escalated to personal case manager. Engineers that come out are clueless and don't report back the problems, end result is order Jan and cancelled in September with no line even being fitted."
Samim,Hampshire,9/18/18,"It’s really horrible and poor service . I move from London as well I call one customer assistant just change and not inform enginier for change Bt connect again I called them what happen I don’t have internet connect . Then another assistant told me it’s only change Adress mention your profile not move your line mention . As well they gave me new contract but without internet . They told me it will be connect inside 24 but not next day I call them every body just only talk with me just 1 minute then cut call , I am really tired , when I told I wanna leave then they stay with me long time without cut my call . Never join with Bt , expensive even poor service ."
Matthew,Cambridge,9/17/18,"Utterly useless company. 6hours on the phone, always the same response with all of their staff... I'm sorry to hear that, let me sort it out... then they dont.

I ran up Virgin and within 20 mins got my wifi at £10 cheaper and it was up and running within 3 days.

AVOID THIS COMPANY"
Diana,Leicester,9/16/18,"miserable services, totally disappointed.paid £7.99 for a one-day voucher and never got the code. tried contacting customer support and all 4 operators I have asked for help have shut the chat window.
most rude, unhelpful and useless people i have ever seen in customer service!
basically, i have paid for some services i still cannot use and their operators refuse to help.
this calls for a complaint to financial ombudsman, i would have never thought that bt is stealing customers' money! shame on you!"
Jack,London,9/16/18,"Switched from another company to BT and had a horrible experience. Their TV service is different from their competitors (Virgin and SKY) meaning I had to rewire all the aerial/antenna system. Also, you need the tv box to be connected to the router, which is not so obvious. I have my router net to my computer for work reasons, and I cannot have my computer next to my phone line and TV at the same time. SO I had to turn my house upside down just to get the cable connected in the right place.
The installation engineer came and did not even open the router, he said I could do it myself.
Total madness"
Pikachu,london,9/15/18,"excellent customer service - glasgow call centre of all places!

i've never had any problems with the internet.

wanted to switch to cheaper broadband provider but was put off by the bad reviews of other isps.

call and haggle for better price at the end of your contract - if need be call more than once. they do reward loyal customers."
James,Glasgow,9/15/18,"Would give zero if possible. I was with EE and BT 'slammed' my line, cutting me off. EE tried to contact BT to get the line back but BT refused, I contacted them myself and got no where. I had nothing to do with this company yet they managed to cut my internet off due to their own error and then refused to fix it. No internet for 3 weeks, eventually had to leave EE and go with Virgin as they have their own phone lines."
Julie,Leigh,9/15/18,"Utter rubbish since getting bt I have nothing but trouble always getting cut off with internet signal saying authentication problem. I reset hub more than once still didn't resolve it I restarted. Y phone making sure that wasn't the problem still didn't solve it. I can't connect to my hub and neither can my kids customer service only open till 22:45am from 7:30am no one on live chat after 22:45 I checked my service in my area it said that the was no faults which must be a load of BS I can't log in with my husbands details (as he is the account holder) kept saying I put the password in wrong to many times,even though it works when I use bt openzone when I am out and about."
Aaron Goodrum,"Perth, Scotland",9/14/18,"2 Years and we have had a fault every week. We have spent days off work waiting for engineers to come round, we have had our business disrupted constantly (self-employed) and lots thousands of pounds through downtime being unable to operate, we have spent the equivalent of what must now be days on the phone trying to raise fault notifications and complaints and we get nowhere. We get charged full price for a service which is operational 50% of the time. We get no compensation and ultimately, the issue never gets fixed. We are leaving."
Syates8,SE London,9/14/18,"I had the ‘20’mb connection. Equating to roughly 1-2mb at peak times and about 4mb at its very best. Can’t even watch a film at peak times with good quality picture.rendering it near enough useless in the evening.
Was told that unless I dip below 0.5mb download then that’s still acceptable. That’s 2.5% of what’s advertised. 2.5%!!!
Avoid at all costs. Had to pay £100 to leave my contract early."
Nick,London,9/14/18,"Shocking customer service, read all these negative reviews before joining but thought I knew better and try it out, regretting this decision now, will see my options as I am without a phoneline and broadband since BT cancelled my Sky subscription without properly processing my order, so now left without anything for minimum 2 and a half weeks, the customer service when I rang up was the worst I've ever known, no one could help me, and the lies and deception from them to get rid of me and transfer me to department tondeoaetment was bad."
Chris,Craven Arms,9/13/18,Total rip off artists. Waited 3 weeks for an install and then 6 months layer got a charge by dd for £240!
Sue,Coates,9/12/18,"Most shocking customer service Ihave probably ever experienced ! Systems and ways of ordering are utterly shambolic ! I moved house and could not get my new service sorted despite many phone calls and hours of my time . Told something different every single time I called . Got given a 2 month post move date for activation then when tried to order new order online got given a date for a week ! It’s a complete joke of a service . I have been with lots of internet providers none of which have been great but BT tops it by a million miles as most shambolic chaotic service with systems in place that are inadequate staff that are either useless or are completely crippled in what they can do by their computer systems . Would not recommend to anyone and as soon as my contract is up I will be leaving no matter how good their tv packages are ..... it’s just not worth the hassle when things go wrong , If my dealing of problems in
My job we’re the same I would have been sacked a long time ago !"
Darren,Cardiff,9/12/18,Shocking customer service - I wish I could leave and go back to Virgin but I would have to pay over £200 on the cancellation fee.
Ged Egan,London,9/11/18,"I got disconnected every hour for a whole year. I called their technical department every week to report it. Each call took at least 45 minutes, after being on hold, security questions and the tests they had to run. Every time, they told me there were no faults on the line, and therefore wouldn't send an engineer.

After complaining, an engineer was sent. He said there were loads of faults on the line and couldn't believe it had been left in such a state. When I complained, the customer service completely ignored my complaint. I escalated the complaint to Cameron Skupski, who was completely useless. I'm still awaiting a response. Horrendous experience."
Mona,Ashton,9/10/18,"I'm so ******* done with BT it's absolutely slowest internet I ever had!!!! Paying monthly is more than 50£ FOR WHAT???? Always disconnect's , very slow, and Then you try to contact services and after you trying to explain the issue they hang up the phone! You know you can find it better network for 50£ in month so I'm so done.!"
Adrian,Stockport,9/9/18,I cant pick up my router from the conservatory and we're in a normal 3 bed semi. It also loses connectivity quite often. tried to get this resolved but they just run the same tests and threaten to charge me £150 to send an engineer out.
Eoghan,,9/7/18,"Constantly broke down and ran at speeds far below what we paid for. Customer service is awkward and clunky. At one point we had an engineer in to fix the box which he said there'd be no charge for. Then, three full months later, he apparently has decided there is a charge, resulting in our final bill being inexplicably almost to £200 instead of the £60 it should have been.

Avoid if you're a student or, for any other reason, have a fragile bank account. The amount of times we've been hit by seemingly random and unexpected charges under these guys is frankly an absolute joke."
Biancab,Manchester,9/4/18,
WeJustNeedWifi,London,9/4/18,"We can't even rate Broadband speed and reliability sections because we didn't even get a connection sorted!
Simply put, we had the worst customer service experience in our life... We were recommended BT Smart Hub by EE staff and we cancelled our precious EE broadband contract and bought BT Smart Hub. It was supposed to be available from 3 weeks ago but then it never happened because of some issues BT had. We made total of 12 phonecalls to check the progress, and each call took 30-1hr. Worst thing is that none of the staff members had clear answer, nor kept a promise to call us back. So after 1 months of no internet period, we decided to cencel the contract.

It seems that their rapid growth in their business is not in parallel with the improvement of training programme for staffs... we were very disappointed and with we didn't stop using our previous router."
Andrea,London,9/4/18,Thieves. The internet in my flat has not been working for a week now. Called them several times and they always say and do the same useless things. The usual switch off and on. They said that if I want to have an engineer coming to fix it I may get charged £120! It's your internet that is not working and I have to pay for it? It's a shame that there are no good broadband companies in the UK. Avoid
Harry,Lincoln,9/4/18,"Took a 24 month contract and PROMISED the price was fixed for term!!!
I was lied to!!!! They increased it!! Now,after I told them I'm leaving, they phone to see if they can beat the price I've been given!!! NOT A CHANCE BY !! YOU'RE RUBBISH!!"
Geoff,Sheffield,9/3/18,Cuts off every day. Never works. Has been happening for the past year constantly. Kicked me off 8 times in an hour. Get sky
Geoff,Sheffield,9/3/18,Complete ****. Got kicked off 8 times in 2 hours. Never works. Complained multiple times and they don't do anything. Get sky
Karl,London,8/31/18,"First the positive- The broadband speed was fine and the service was reliable about 95% of the time.

And that is the only good thing I can say. the customer service is APPALLING. I have wasted hours of my life trying to get seemingly simple things sorted out. Firstly they changed the installation dates 3 times, the final time without telling me leading to costs being incurred through the previous provider (they changed it 3 days early, leading to a penalty fine from the previous provider for still being in contract). Then they didn't transfer my number. And told me they couldn't because. [insert whichever lie they decided to tell that day]. Seriously, no 2 people ever gave me the same answer as to why I had lost my phone number. Including one person who said it was impossible to even have the number! A surprise to us, as it had been our number for 3 years.... After 3 months of complaining they gave me £20 in compensation!! Then it took 9months for them to give me the award card I was owed. Because their system was wrong. You have no idea how frustrating it is being told you're wrong, when you have an email FROM BT telling me I was in fact correct. The final straw was when they raised the prices. this gave me a way to get out of my contract without a penalty and STILL they are screwing me around.

Nothing is ever easy. Everytime I contacted them I had to speak to multiple people, who would all open new complaints rather than deal with the one already open. Or insist on closing a complaint that wasn't fixed. With a few exceptions the support staff I dealt with were rude, at best incompetent and on more than one occasion lied to me.

AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS. If you have no problems you will probably be OK, but even minor problems will probably take weeks if not months to sort out."
David,London,8/30/18,"Just shocking all round. Poor speeds, unreliable connection, poor customer service... the list goes on. BT under the misapprehension they still have a broadband monopoly. Off to Vodafone."
Nora Sami,Windsor,8/30/18,"The most disgraceful customer service ever. All the staff are ridiculously unhelpful and have done nothing but make our lives miserable for the past 3 months. The internet did not work for 3 months and every time we called for help either someone was misleading, the staff lied or hung up during the middle of the call. Appalling service and internet connection. This company should be ashamed of the name they have built for themselves as so many people are complaining about them and so many unhappy customers. We have been lied to and spent most evenings on the phone to customer service instead of relaxing at home with the family. Tragic company and customer service. Would not recommend BT to anyone as they take you money and provide you nothing. After 14 years of being their customer I am shocked by what we have experienced.

Absolutely horrendous."
Daniel Foley,Cranfield,8/29/18,"Literally furious. Why, why on earth do they exist to cause such misery.

The worst steaming pile of overpriced horsemuck.

The connection is terrible, their custom services are useless. Their website is always under maintenance when I sign in to try pay a bill, their Indian call centre is so frustrating,im done.

Going to set fire to their equipment and walk away.

STAY Away from BT."
Steve,Lichfield,8/29/18,"Terrible, the so called 'off shore' Team should be abandoned and technical support brought back to this Country, they are blatant liars and completely incompetent, say they will call back and never do, falsify their tickets with lies, disgusting."
Eddie Expert,Australia,8/29/18,Appalling service. Ryan was so rude and difficult to work with.
Mohammed,Bradford,8/28/18,"Was only with these cowboys for less then 2 week. They had me on the wrong package so called to tell them which they assured me would be sorted and someone would call me back after 2 days, no phone call so called again to be told sorry nothing has been done and we have no idea something had to be. They did nothing at all on the phone but did cut me off, so I called back and cancelled which they didn’t even hesitate to do. Now I’m without internet and have transferred back to Virgin. STAY away from BT, absolutely poor customer service."
john toobey,liverpool,8/28/18,"After being with TT for many years of trouble free service. I got a call out of the blue from a BT telesales person, who basically lied to me that I would save a lot of money by switching to BT, which I fell for. What a mistake, it was never the price that was given to me, we couldn't receive incoming calls for 6 weeks, which they couldn't explain or fix, no matter how many times I called their useless helpline. After being with them for several months, the set top box would only tune to Welsh TV channels, which was permanent, no matter how many times it was retuned. The helpline is useless, their only advice was to retune the box, or it was the TV aerial, I told them I had retuned it 10 times or more, and it was a new aerial, then to be told "" I don't know what we're going to do "". The final straw came when after 8 months they notified me that my bill was to be increased by £25 per month. This was just for a basic service. I cancelled my direct debit and just lately I have been receiving letters from a debt collecting agency, demanding substantially more than a months BT payment plus 25 percent what BT added for administrative cost. DONT USE BT THEY ARE A LYING THEIVING JOKE."
Laurence,London,8/27/18,"I had a website built by BT. They tied me up in a contract, the contract ended but I continued to pay and use their services. I transferred the service and they continued to charge. I cancelled and had to cancel via two separate departments and they refused to refund any money due to not informing them.

It turned out that I was paying £36 a month for ""management fees"" that I did not need at all so BT have earned very nicely indeed!

I have also been paying £24 every quarter for hosting and required only hosting after the 1st year.

So yes BT was charging me £42 a month when I should have been paying only £6 a month.

When I phoned BT to cancel and BT said they want more money as notice is required - I said I will pay but will let everyone know what the BT Corporation is like (she said ""you are more than welcome to do that"" ). So they are on...

BT gave me an 0800 number that linked to my mobile number but did not get missed calls or any answerphone. So I missed out on customers.

BT gave me email addresses linked to my domain but was not able to setup the password and server details to access the emails. So missed out on any emails sent to my advertised email addresses. This was an ongoing issue with many calls.

BT deleted all my emails on their servers once I had transferred the hosting although I was still paying.

BT put the phone down on me when I asked them to look into whether they could retrieve my emails on their servers (I know because they did not call back). This is expected as I am a leaving customer.

BT purchased EE and without delay Orange's reputation was gone, their customer service went down hill, trying to worm out of warranties and prices hiked.

BT said the website they created me was terrible and I needed to upgrade to £150 a month from £36. A year later when I made inquiries they said that the company they used is no longer trading and I did not get the upgrade at all, so they refunded the money back dated.

In summary: BT are too large, too controlling, too financially focused and uncaring towards its customers. They have the money for large advertising campaigns, to buy other companies out and to perfect contract terms/conditions to their advantage. They don't have the necessary knowledge to assist you with technical issues.

In fact I think a small claims court may get me several years of management fees back as they have never been used. I will report back how that pans out.

I beg you to not use BT and to inform your family/friends to avoid like the plague.

Thank you. Together we can make a difference.

Are you still considering BT? Think I may be unlucky one customer? BT charged me an additional £5 a month to have ""itemised bills"" that had nothing to itemise. I phoned to cancel and ask for a refund and they said ""no it is your responsibility to cancel it even though you did not set it up"".

BT (Be There)."
I,Don’t,8/26/18,"BT have an OK broadband speed, this is not just me but other people I have spoken to. However they also have a very poor customer service, and broadband reliability is something which almost doesn’t exist when you’re with BT. Internet randomly shuts off, currently using my mobile data to write this review because the internet shut off again would you believe it or not. Wouldn’t recommend, go for Virgin Media instead."
Jackie power,Torquay,8/24/18,Very disappointed. Worked well for 9 months then problem after problem and poor customer service. Helpful and polite people but sent around the houses. Ie told what I wanted to hear. We think problem is router. One will be with you in 48hrs. Someone then tells me order was cancelled. Another tells me it was never ordered. No Wi-fi for weeks. A member of staff hung up on me on live chat. No I want rude. Told today problem was with my devices ie suggesting I ring 6 manufacturers and complain to them.
Paul,Antrim,8/24/18,"Signed up for 18 month contract and Paying for SUPERFAST FIBRE Advertised Average speed is 50Mb. Only getting 0.01Mbs!! phoned the call centre and they say my guaranteed speed is only 0.5Mbs!!!. They said it said this in the small print on the contract and laughed at me saying "" Ha Ha Ha.. You did not read the small print"" upgrade to the fastest service, I am already paying for the fastest service available, why am I being charged for premium service and getting slower than dialup? I work from home and can't work, it very frustrating and my employer is not impressed I could lose my job over this.I have spent 12+ hours trying to be understood by a foreign call centre. They won't do anything to try and help me BT don't care if I loose my job over this!!!"
Kezia,UK,8/23/18,"May I never go back to BT ever!

I am asking for one simple change to take place and it has resulted in a ful 1-2 month saga with so much emotional hassle!

The broadband and reliability as a standard are great. The customer service is not.

I do not and may not ever return back to BT. I am a long time serving customer who has now lost so much money in bills loopholes and bad customer service. I do not and will not ever from now on recommend ever trying their service. No matter how much incentive they will give in Amazon discounts. I am too disgusted by their treatment of one simple request."
Mark Klamberg,Oxford,8/23/18,"I have three problems which have not yet been resolved although I have contacted customer service +20 times. No help from online chat or when phoning customer service.
1. BT sent an engineer to install internet and BT TV. The engineer installed internet but not BT TV. I did that myself and cannot get all the channels I was promised.
2. It is not possible to activate BT ID which is necessary to pay invoices. I was asked to give a security question - my mother's maiden name - when I ordered BT that would later be used to activate BT ID. When I am asked my mother's maiden name they say it is the wrong answer - I know my mother's maiden name.
3. When the engineer was in my home to install internet and BT TV he damaged the walls, two clearly visible, medium sized spots on the paint on the wall. I have made a complaint and received no reaction or remedy. Dont order BT internet/TV."
Sam,West midlands,8/23/18,"Bt are an absolute disgrace, 3 weeks waiting for a refund, told I would get a call back almost daily, still not sorted, customer service is next to non, there's been 2 advisors out of all of them I've spoke to that have actually tried to help. Getting through to someone that knows what they are talking about is a mission in itself. Very unhappy ex customer!"
James Sparkes,Sheffield,8/22/18,"Had a great service until after 2 years with broadband the contract ends and I end up getting charged £50, for 2 months in a row.

It was really nice for BT to tell me the contract would be ending and I would need to give them notice before leave. Absolutely appalling! I would recommend them highly before this happened, but I will not be returning in the future!"
Bespoke bathing company,Evesham,8/21/18,
andy,Hertford,8/21/18,"BT are without any shadow of a doubt the WORST company of any of the telephony provides. Their customer service is SHOCKING, we tried to cancel our domestic line, they incorrectly cut off our business line and broadband. We are a retail business and could not take card payments for a week. To cap it all they tried to charge us to reconnect even after they admitted it was their error and tried to tell us we were in a new contract as a result. They really shouldn't have the name ""British"" in their title, they are a disgrace to this country. Ive had to spend countless hours on the phone to them, and with their overseas call centres getting anything done is nigh on impossible, assuminy you can actually understand the person you are talking to. I will be ditching BT business in favour of Virgin Media business (I have Virgin Media at home now), they may not be perfect but they are a darn sight better than BT"
Graham,Essex,8/20/18,"I have been with BT Broadband since FTTC became available in 2015. I have no complaints at all. Performance has been fast and rock solid, although I have been using my own router rather than the BT HUb. Customer service has been very good (by phone and on-line chat). The cost is on the high side but I am reluctant to switch to cheaper and probably worse competitors. One last point, this is an honest review of my experience with BT as a customer. I have no oher relationship with the company."
Greg Clark,Bridgend,8/20/18,"BT Broadband- The Worst Customer service I’ve ever Experienced. I signed up for BT TV and broadband having recently moved house. The installation was meant to be free but they charged me £59. Called to complain and was told the refund would be in my account within 24 hours. One week later had to call again as still no refund. Finally got that money back a few days later.

On the day the installation was due to happen I didn’t receive any communication so checked online and it showed the engineer was confirmed. Just to be sure I used instant chat and was told the same thing. The time slot came and went and the engineer never showed. Called to complain and was told they didn’t know if I needed a new line so rather than check or ask they just cancelled the appointment I had waited 6 weeks for.

Decided 3 complaint calls was enough before even getting the service so decided to cancel the contract. It then took a further 4 x 30min+ calls over 3 days for them to actually cancel. Two weeks on I still haven’t received my refund for the engineer cost and have been charged a bill for a service I never received. Another two hours on the phone and many promises made and I’m still waiting for a refund.

I’m sure the service is great if you ever get it but if you have a problem forget about it because no-one there seems to be able to help. They are very apologetic and all promise to help but they all blame the processes or the systems and there doesn’t seem to be any joined up thinking between departments."
Vicki Francis,Wokingham,8/19/18,"Our whole experience with BT has been terrible 6 weeks to get connected, countless calls to customer service, been on hold for countless minutes 55 minutes one day!! Miss informed, cut off, passed to 5 different departments. Finally up and running, we have fibre but it drops off. TV package is a joke wish we had stayed with sky"
Tom,Argyll,8/18/18,I have been with BT for 10 years and watched their customer service slide and slide to the point they are unreliable and take a long time and a lot of calling to resolve basic problems. Staff vary in knowledge and helpfulness.
Rebecca Dingwall,Inverness,8/16/18,Absolutely useless!!!!!! Cuts off all the time!!!!!
Chesca,Stoke On Trent,8/15/18,"if i could give 0 stars i would. thought talk talk was bad until i switched to BT. no wifi absolutely anywhere, be prepared to be charged over for your phone bills because youre going to need your data"
Richard,Uk,8/15/18,"It took years for this company to learn the lesson of having UK based call centres. Now it needs to stop spending vast sums on t.v. advertising,computerised answer systems and its preoccupation with the idea that all the customer wants is to watch sport,especially soccer. This company needs to invest in PEOPLE. To improve the dismal customer care they currently provide.I simply want to ring up, talk to a human who can provide the information or help required or connect me with another human who can.Unfortunately that would require an outbreak of common sense and upset the share-holders.The company is ,however, extremely adept when increasing the price of service.This no doubt makes the share-holders happy and profits can be spent on adverts to avoid over-taxation.There must be better out there..."
Manassah Taylor,SHEFFIELD SOUTH YORKSHIRE,8/15/18,"I left sky to move to bt only because I wanted bt sports for the champions league and sky was not offering that service. It like leaving an ok relationship in search for a better one but instead find yourself in a worse relationship but u can not leave because of the kids. In this case bt is bad relationship and the contract is the kids. The customer service team is really poor at their job. I woke up this morning with my services down, I phone in and the first adviser I spoke with hang the call off because I asked him to give me 5 minuets to find my customer number, when I phone back in to explain what I went through with the first customer service advisor he didn’t stop to think that I am not happy but better still talk over me. I then tried to explain that I make arrangements to clear up my account on Friday 17th August he went in confrontation mode saying my account was blocked because I didn’t pay my bills and the extension time slot is 7days. I tried to make him understand that bt customer service team is really poor at their job just by everything I experienced that I can’t recommend anyone to bt. This isn’t the first time. It is the fourth times this happening the first three was my internet being very slow but for every time when I call back in to cancel my services I will speak to one of the good once I was asked to upgrade my service. Right now I can only take enough if this continues, my only option is to leave and for me personally I won’t recommend anyone to use this service."
Linas,Ilford,8/15/18,"On 6th of July a month in advance I made a call to bt customer service and asked to close my account and stop providing services when my contract ends which is 6th. Bt guy said that my contract ends on 15th of August, I asked to confirm that I won't be charged any extra money and I will be refunded £43 because I'm paying upfront, and the BT guy confirmed that is correct. Now turns out BT guy was lying, I still have BT service and I was charged £58 and not refunded !!!"
Ian,Ayr,8/14/18,"It's just rubbish,my previous provider was so much better, in fact my non fibre broadband was more reliable.BT haven't come up with a reason and despite this and whilst I'm paying £33 per month they have the cheek to tell me last month that they are to increase my
Monthly fee.Ha ha
Don't do not.. Plusnet way better."
Grumpyoldman,Birmingham,8/13/18,"I didn't get past the first hurdle with BT. I called them, as a potential new customer, to just enquire about a deal. I found a deal that suited me, but emphasised I would not make a commitment before I had a chance to think. Foolishly I gave my address, phone number and email, but happily no bank details. Soon after I had emails showing I had an account and a start date. I thought this was wrong as I had not agreed to this, but thought I would go with this, any way. The start date didn't suit me, so I called to change it. It took them 52 minutes to answer, by which time I was seething. I decided if this is typical customer service then I would cancel the order, that I had not agreed to. Bad way to treat people BT and I'll have nothing to do with your dodgy business practices!"
Stephen,Lincoln,8/12/18,"Very poor customer service as they insist they sent a letter regarding 2018 September price rises.
As I am greater than 30 days since letter was sent I cannot cancel my contract.
This was the same senario the last time BT INCREASED its prices.
Funny how these letters are very in portal but are not sent recorded delivery.
What a joke."

Alan,Kent,8/11/18,"Absolutely disgusting. I was having connection and speed issues with my old provider ""NOW TV"", and was promised the world if i moved to BT. What i signed up for was BT infinity with all calls just as NOW TV at supposedly £38.00 per month. What i got was a huge bill in the first month for calls made to Poland which they failed to include in my mi-sold package. The usual messing around online and on the phone persued, and they then had to increased my package price to £45.00 (naughty naughty), to include the international calls which NOW TV actually provided for £38.00 and which i was promised. Another week or two and i receive a letter in the post informing me of another price increase of up to around £50.00 per month to keep my package. Again i complained and was told i could have my package frozen at £45.00 if i renewed my contract (naughty naughty). After a long discussion with an adviser i was told that i was also actually paying for sport channels which i never asked for. I took his advice and had the package changed yet again, and was fairly happy with the service at £45.00 per month. Then my speed and connection problems came for another visit and i spent hours on the phone trying to sort it with another technical adviser. It was found to be a faulty router which i was promised was the best thing since sliced bread when they mis-sold me the original package. A new router was sent and we all had fun re-signing passwords once again. Then my next bill came in!!!! £61.19. I was by this time furious and sent some choice word emails and once again messed around on the phone and online. THREE times i was dis,connected from a live chat and nobody wanted to help. After blowing my fuse and making threats of desertion i was told sorry Mr Stephens but they have made a mistake with your call plan and have charged you for local and international calls. They had also messed up in both June and July and simply added the extra cost to your new bill, but here`s £7.00 back as a refund..""yeh right"".. Absolutely disgusting. I have now cancelled my contract and moved on because of their persistent errors and incompetence. Now they call me and tell me i have to pay a fee of over £400 for leaving a mis-sold contract to early. ""Bring it on BT"". I am so looking forward to our day in court when your incompetence and persistent lies are made public."
Tariq Shah,United Kingdom,8/11/18,"The most appalling customer service I have ever received. Few months ago I received an email offering me 2gb extra on my sim at no extra cost ,oif I sign up for 18 months contract. My mistake, I fell into this trap and signed up to this deal. I received an email from BT explaining that you will now receive extra 2GB but my bill would increase by £10 more. I spoke to several customer service people and complaint was open long time ago with no resolution. Early last month one of their agents advised me that I have two separate accounts with Bt one for mobile and one for land line and broadband if I merge these accounts my mobile data allowance will double up from 8 to 16 GB at no extra cost and he will also resolve billing issue for me. Again my mistake it’s been weeks neither my data has doubled up nor my billing has been resolved. My complaint was escalated to level 2 and I was told that they will sort it within 5 days. Yesterday on completion of 5 day deadline I spoke with BT and I have now been told that department is very busy and they don’t know how long this will take to settle. Furthermore since merging two accounts extra services which are offered by the BT eg parental control, web protection have been locked and I am unable to make any changes to their settings. I have reported this issue to broadband tech support team separately on multiple occasions but in spite of their promises no one has been able to resolve this issue either. It appears that departments are not talking to each other and they have a field team responsible to sort out some of the issues but other departments have no phone access to field team. I feel so frustrated and angry with such poor customer experience and don’t know where to go next. All customer service advisors speak in a very polite manner and apologise for the inconvenience multiple times but no actions are taken to resolve the complaint. No one is willing to take ownership and every time you ring your call ends up in a different office and every time I have to start telling them my issue from start. It is so depressing."
Calver,Norfolk,8/10/18,Absolute rubbish.no broadband for over 9 days so far still not back on. Phoned numerous times to be told it'll be on within 48hours and it still hasn't. Been hung up on twice. Can't understand the foreigners. You'll be waiting for ever just until someone picks up the phone! Most useless company ever to deal with
Steve Hurley,Lichfield,8/10/18,"Poor all round service, BT need to get rid of the off shore Indian contingent they are at best incompetent. Also beware of which support number you use to call them they have the cheek to actually charge you for them to rectify their issues. Also the Broadband speed is poor most of the time however the service remains reliable. I dread having to call their support service which is simply awry, disorganised and quite simply rubbish."
Lisa Hall,Fife,8/10/18,This has to be the worst service we have ever had from any provider. On going issues from 24 hrs after install. 5 months on still not resolved to be constantly told there are no faults. So why do we have no broadband or phone line working????
DIABOLICAL,england,8/10/18,
Harvey,Bradford,8/9/18,DO NOT go with BT total joke my bill has gone up they failed to inform me regarding this if i could give them zero stars i would they solve nothing when you call them ither that or you can't understand a word of what there saying. DON'T GO WITH BT
Michael Burnside,Outside Ballymena,8/8/18,"Just Diabolical

We have went through 6 hubs all of them undoubtedly terrible. So i live in the country side, a few miles outside Ballymena and bt is terrible. Is funny (not really) because all bt want is money. It used to be i could have my phone, laptop and Xbox on the wifi and it would still be strong but one day as promised bt said they’d put fibre opic in the area we were super excited but all they did was slowed all our wifis down to crawling speed and the only way to speed it up to what it used to be is by buying fibre opic which is an extra £25 pounds a month (we already pay £35) hate bt and when i grow up (im 15) im gettin sky or something better because bt is terrible in every way would say about the other points above but i dont wanna bor you"
Khosro,STOCKPORT,8/7/18,"By absolutely rubbish - current download speed 0.6 mb just not good enough for anything and spending £75 a month for nothing!! Total waste of money!
do not use BT."
Matthew Taylor,UK,8/7/18,"Continuous problems with BT including overcharging, deal issues, terrible customer service, etc.

Just been cut off after waiting on another complaints call for 30 mins before anybody picked up.

AVOID BT or risk spending 10+ hours per year on the phone to them."
Bradley Davis,Derbyshire,8/7/18,"Out of contract and moving home I reluctantly paid bt’s extortionate month by month costs before finding a better service elsewhere so cancelled the dd at my bank.

My bank then informed bt and I got the expectedofficious call to ‘investigate’ why. I informed them then on the phone I wanted nothing more to do with them and cancelled.

Big mistake doing it verbally as bt maliciously kept my account open! That was two months ago and I am still receiving threatening demands for money I cannot afford and with no written proof I cancelled am subject to continuing extortion.. threatening language in their emails escalating despite attempts to sort it out humanely; the nasty Corp bullying lying fascists!

If I don’t submit and pay what they demand I face debt collectors and reporting to credit agencies!

Charming BT!"
David,Hereford,8/6/18,"Appalling service..They 'conned' us into a further 18 contract while we still had 6 months to go on our original contract.
Didn't find out until we decided to leave...Then they wanted £200 penalty."
Bobby Knowles,Birmingham United Kingdom,8/5/18,"BT provide the most atrocious, awful, poor, unacceptable, unsatisfactory and the worst and most terrible internet ever. I have been with many different internet providers and BT of all services has absolutely shocked me with how godawful their service is. BT say they are supposedly and I quote ""the most best and fastest internet provider"" out of all the internet providers in the UK. Well if you as the public people want a real and honest answer then here it is. BT are such false advertisers and it is completely ripped off the internet for over 1 whole year now has been turning itself on and off every 1 minute so for every 5 minutes our internet switches itself on and off about 20+ times and that is completely ridiculous they do not provide any satisfactory customer service whatsoever and I say their company and everything else is a complete failure to themselves and to me, my family and everyone else who is still with then at the moment because I don't know if anyone else is having too many issues to count but if so don't be shy at all to speak out because I am no longer staying with with dread nightmare awful and absolutely God dam horrendous service any more i get more data from my ee data plan (4g) so that says it all. Thank you for my service."
Phillip Davis,Clapham South West London,8/4/18,BT is quite inefficient. I cannot access my billing. Whenever I want a new password the activation code will not come with email open. The BT page will not work on top of open email. Basic inefficiency.
Harry,London,8/3/18,Promised £140 mastercard voucher advertised as part of the deal never arrived. Online customer support chat system is rubbish. Landline charges are insane. They increased charges within one month of me signing the contract. Broadband sync speed shown on the router is less than 1/3rd of the “guaranteed” speed. Totally uncompetitive product and service which they can only get away with because they are the default landline supplier. Please avoid. I used to be a Virgin customer and although not perfect they were WAY better than BT.
Poova,Ilford,8/2/18,Poor service as even when I complained I was told a manager will call me . Never received a a call back . Never received refund for the days I did not have the broadband service and this has happened three times despite promises. Now thinking of moving to Virgin as they have their own lines as they do not rent BT lines . Will challenge the end of the contract if need be and welcome feedback from anyone who is on the same situation. BT should not threaten people that they have to pay for the full contract if they can’t deliver the service and this needs to be decided in a court of law .
Tode Despotoski,Swindon,7/31/18,"I strongly NOT recommend BT.
I’m BT user for 6 mounts and I’m very disappointed. The internet is very unreliable. My smart Hub restarts almost every day and even the TV channels stops sometime. I was watching F1 Stonehenge and I missed half of the race, I was really pissed off. Beside that I supposed to get BT gift card with £120 on it. I assumed I will receive by post or I will get email for any info, after few mounts when I asked them the response was my card expired. I had 90 day to claim but nobody told me, due to I didn’t I lost my gift. That was one of the reasons why I switched to BT. Firs time on BT and definitely last!!!"
Andrew,Kinross,7/31/18,"Absolutely awful.

I switched from now tv and have been without broadband for 3 weeks and counting. I'm also having to phone daily to keep things moving.

I am extremely regretful of ever switching to BT. They have been the worst isp I've ever had the misfortune to use."
Alan,WIMBORNE,7/31/18,"I utterly resent using these people. I am paying 45 a month for 8mb download and that has been completely unreliable on a daily basis, I have so many calls logged each time after a few weeks the service drops back to unusable. This all resulted after moving, in their defence BT was ok at my previous address. BT as a company should not be granted the monopoly to dictate our internet infrastructure as we are clearly falling behind our competitors in Europe, whilst they make more and more money. You are a disgrace BT and all the directors involved."
Sam,Red Lodge,7/31/18,"Literally the WORST customer service I have experienced in my 32 years of life. Ordered broadband on 5 July (it’s currently 31 July) after the IT team cancelled my appointment to set up my internet WITHOUT my knowledge the team couldn’t figure out why the broadband wasn’t working, so after 4 calls and 72 hours of waiting between each call, they set up a service tech appointment. The tech never showed up. After I called, the CS rep said they couldn’t do anything until 24 hours had passed after the missed appointment, at that point they could reschedule! This company is an absolute joke."
Sol,London,7/29/18,Terrible and horrible. Never again. Do not use BT internet
Samantha,Iver,7/29/18,"Left BT years ago. Went to Sky but found badly affected by the weather so moved house and changed to Virgin. Price doubled at end of contract so was recommended to BT. Have a bundle and nothing but problems. TV channel choice is rubbish. You absolutely have to have unlimited broadband to operate properly despite being told basic package would be fine. Sometimes you get someone who knows what they are talking about, but generally you get an idiot who cannot solve an issue and just makes it up as they go along. Bitterly regret returning to BT as, if anything, worse than it used to be and now stuck with a long contract."
Diana,London,7/29/18,"I believe I have had one of the worst experiences with BT. They increase prices without notice although I was guaranteed a price for a certain time period, I need to restart the router quite often to get a decent speed although theoretically I have 50mb infinity 1 broadband and live in central London. I will change suppliers now as my experience with them is just bad and not worth the hassle."
Nicola,Hertfordshire,7/29/18,
CMM,Chesterton Peterborough,7/28/18,Our broadband has suddenly become much slower even though WE have not changed anything. It's gone from 4.5 mb to 1.2 mb in our area so we can no longer watch any channelling the iplayer. I think BT stinks!!!!!
Daniel,"Campsea Ashe, Woodbridge",7/27/18,"Being a customer of BT is a condemnation to a torturous experience. If I had to choose between using BT or returning to the dark days of no Internet connection, I may as well choose the latter because they are essentially the same thing but I don't have to pay money for the 2nd option."
Kian,Thornton-clevelys,7/25/18,"Pay nearly a hundred pound a month for this and can’t even play one console game without disconnecting, rediculous and we even have been sent multiple routers."
Olivia,England,7/25/18,"ABSOLUTE TRASH. the slowest wifi ever.
27 kb/s is the worst. had an engineer out and didnt help one bit. The first engireer also didnt show up. Abominable and horrendous service and wifi. I think you should stop providing wifi and go away. No one should ever use your services and save their money. Plusnet is better than u. Screw u bt"
Mark,BIRMINGHAM,7/22/18,"All OK for the first couple of years - just one major outage that lasted for two days.

BUT...last 12 months has been totally unreliable...last month absolutely unusable at times with slow speeds and drop outs many times each day.

They keep insisting that there are no external problems in my area when I know for a fact that many others in South Birmingham have similar issues + the industry watchdogs have logged dozens of outages with BT Broadband.

Virgin Media here I come!"
John B,Portsmouth,7/21/18,"Within a few months of signing up for an 18 month fixed 35 pound a month contract, the fee began rising. Eventually within 12 months that cost had risen to 50 pound. I spoke to their call centre about this where I was belittled, laughed at and told I was in contract so couldn't change without fees.

The speed as advertised was fast, but the customer service was atrocious and unacceptable.

I do not wish to subsidise their ridiculous football package options and rural BB customers so have decided to go elsewhere for half of the price and the same BB speed."
Robbie,Slough,7/20/18,"Honestly, the broadband speed isn't that bad, but what makes BT so disappointing is the customer service and reliability. BT worked fine until about a year ago when it started cutting off for no reason. I've contacted BT and they said nothing is wrong with it. I only have 1 regret and that is staying with BT for this long. If you are looking for a good broadband, go to virgin... I would suggest against getting BT."
Micheal,Ashington,7/20/18,Internet kept dropping out and i Spent months on the phone to them to be fobbed off and passed on saying they've found a fault but arnt sure what it is had engineers booked and cancelled without being informed so took a unpaid day off work for nothing they have no interest in fixing anything and have said I'm entitle to no compensation because it isn't total loss of internet it's only intermittent but what use is internet if it only works for 5 minutes then disconnects for 5 minutes and so on this is the worst broadband I've ever had and as for the call centres being up based what a load of manure this company should be called Indian telecom
Spas Petrov,Aberdeen,7/19/18,"Don’t use BT!!!!!!
Ordered online a deal, in a week time checked my account and got message that my order has been cancelled. Contact BT and I’ve been told that reason is not visible and been suggested to reordered. Went online and Booooom reason for cancellation appears on my screen same offer £6 higher!!!!!!!!! Called them again explained, but nothig offer is diferent Sorry"
Tony Hewitt,Knowsley,7/19/18,"Absolute nightmare organisation. No communication between any of the staff and up to 6 calls per day from representatives saying the same things over and over again! I believe they have an automated system which cant be switched off and they can only put notes on their system which, obviously, nobody reads.

Many of the calls can not understand what you are saying which makes it impossible to have a conversation. They just repeat the same thing over and over again.

Quite oblivious to customer service and will blatantly say you are a liar when you explain what the other represented said.

God knows how this company manages to survive - i certainly would never use them again,"
Phil Pick,Lincolnshire,7/19/18,"BT are by 100 miles the absolute worst Phone and Broadband supplier it has ever been my misfortune to deal with!
They have a service contract Leadtime of 14 days to reconnect an account to the exchange when you move house. It takes nothing effort wise to carry out this work and yet they insist on doing it through their (non official) side kick company Openreach. Two price increases in 6 months and they don't have the resources available to connect a long standing customer on the same day.
Broadband is everything, without it you are dead in the water when you most need it after moving house.

Shame on you BT, one day hopefully you will be nationalised again as all country infrastructure should be so it works for the good of the people and not fat cat salaries to people that could not manage themselves let along BT, look at Italy, how many of those fat cats had their eye on the ball? Answers on a postcard. All profit should be fully invested back into the countries infrastructure, that way we would not still have copper pair connections into many houses still, but fibre everywhere, most 3rd world countries outperform the UK in terms of their infrastructure and that is because BT have done nothing with the billions of pounds they have made over many years, other than pay ever higher salaries and shareholders!"
DSM,BIRMINGHAM,7/18/18,if it works the speed is in line with other providers but it only works 50% of the time
Charlotte,Riding Mill,7/18/18,"Absolutely appalling service! Please do not use BT! Had to wait 2 months for the Broadband to be installed without any communicating or updates from BT, I had to do all the chasing and challenging to ensure that we eventually got internet at all! We were passed from pillar to post each time we rang customer services and each time promised that the issues would be solved-each time we were left disappointed.
To further the disappointing experience that we’ve had with BT, after the broadband was installed, we received numerous bills stating that we owed them money and adding unpaid bill charges onto our account. When I set up the account originally I had added a direct debit which was being taken out of our account, so was baffled as to why I was receiving fines when I had been paying the bills. After having to call BT again to sort this issue out I discovered that they’d actually set up two accounts in my name and where trying to charge us for both of those accounts-one that I was paying for by direct debit and the other one that they were sending us bills for! I couldn’t believe the incompetence and sheer cheek! They apologised and said that they would reimburse us and sort out accounts so that there was only one. A week later….we received another bill-again adding fines for not paying! An on-going joke!
Ironically, we went with BT as they are a well-established company who we thought would be good at dealing with any issues: an absolute untruth! Just awful!"
Martyn,Greenock,7/16/18,I had to get BT as virgin is not in my area. Worst bradband speed and customer experience ever. 4mb download and 0.5mb upload on a 38mb package witch is a lot slower than the 200mb virgin bb i had. 4 different excuses as to the fault. Hung up on by advisor twice. Engineer never tur ed up. Then told me the fault was fixed when it clearly isn't. As soon as virgin are in my area bye bye BT. You are 10 years behind and the customer service are horrendous and ill advised and I suspect no IT eduction in any way. Probably read from a script.
Carol Matthews,Staffordshire,7/16/18,"I was with BT for 12 months customer service was not always hepful usual answer was ""It's working okay our side"" they advertise as being customer orientated but in truth no better than some others and mt broadband kept dropping out and was slow even though i wax on tge fastest fibre"
Walter,GLASGOW,7/15/18,"Left BT many years ago due to atrocious customer service. Took up their offer of faster stronger broadband and also signed up for BT Sport. The broadband promise never materialized, I still don`t have BT Sport due an unidentified technical fault and when I attempt to speak to someone then its either a long wait to speak to someone or a chat with someone who`s handling a number of clients at the one time and is untrained and keeps saying I`ll be right with you in two minutes but inevitably can`t help you because ""that`s dealt with by a different team"" etc etc etc but they`ll be with you in two minutes etc etc etc
BT customer service has deteriorated from atrocious to mega atrocious.
Don`t go near BT unless you have a bottle of wine and some valium to hand and time to spare."
Theo Wood,Bristol,7/15/18,"Have had problems about 1 month ago when broadband was dropping ...got through to Dublin almost straight away and they found out it was a problem at their end.

Worked OK for a month then dropping again ...got through to Dublin again...after checking - it was a problem at our end- identified as the very old Hub2. We received a new Hub4 by post the next day."
Dr Reddy,Leicester,7/14/18,"Absolutely unpredictable and unreliable internet connection, keeps dropping off. The customer service is shocking and they are either clueless or deny any problems. I will never use BT internet again in my life nor reccommend to anyone."
Amelia,No,7/14/18,
Brendan McHugh,Scotland,7/12/18,"Customer service is absolutely appalling.
Numerous phone calls to many people who have no idea what they are talking about.
They disconnected my broadband but apparently were unaware on whatever system they were claiming to be looking at.
Then they booked an engineer who was in no position to undo the handy work of whatever genius decided to disconnect me.
Last of all I was told that if I wanted to reconnect I would have to enter a new contract.
A horrendous experience of going completely offline for weeks with nobody capable of sorting it out.
Never again BT, and to think how many hundreds of millions of public money this company pocketed."
Raymond,Cornwall,7/11/18,"I ordered Fibre Broadband on 20th April, was booked in for 22nd May... nobody turned up. Was re-booked for 11th June, engineers turned up but it turns out they was going to supply it wrong address... was re-booked for July 4th, i rang on 2nd July to confirm they was coming.... nobody turned up !! Was then told it was being put in on the 12th July... Only to be told this afternoon it isn't being done now until 17th July. Cancelled my order... useless doesn't even start to describe how utterly rubbish BT are... For a large communications company, it doesn't bode well when you can't even communicate between your own departments... Almost 3 months and still no service. Absolute disgrace !!"
M. Donachy,Cambridge,7/10/18,"The difficulty of setting up service from BT is an extraordinary experience.
Having received a14 page letter advising me of procedures,
benefits and the usual administration policies, l waited on the advised day, after cancelling work to accommodate the arranged visit.
The 5 hour slot for the engineer reached halfway, after -which I spent 40 minutes on the phone to ascertain the
likelihood of an appearance.
Having been given 2 order numbers, the result of the confusion was that my order was cancelled because of a
systems failure. Unable to give any indication as to when
an engineer could be organised - because the system would not allow it - I asked to speak to the line-manager who
unsurprisingly was “not on floor”.
I now wait with eager anticipation for the next instalment of
‘Systems Are Us’.
As a communication company BT can only stand for Bloody
Terrible."
John,Essex,7/10/18,"Been with BT for many years now, only ever had one drop out in all that time. BT told me my broadband/phone line bill will increase from £36.99 to £45.50 a month in September.
I phoned their customer services and spoke to a lovely Lancashire lass who dropped the price increase plus a further discount.
Now paying less than I was a week ago.
Well pleased!"
KD,Worcestershire,7/9/18,"The broadband was ok, no problem. But their customer service is horrendous. My husband's name is on the account and, when he left, I took over paying the bill but they could not change the name on the account. It just seemed beyond them. Either I close it and reopen in my name, but there is no guarantee it's not gojng to be more expensive, so I left it as it is. I phoned twice to renew the existing contract, in order not to be charged more - was reassured it will be 36.99 for broadband/landline package for 18 months. That was in Feb 2018, and in May I was charged 45.99. No one told me about May date when I was renewing the contract, so I left. Each time they kept asking me if 'I'm authorised to speak for the account"" and the blimming husband's name keeps popping up. I paid by DD all 8 years and this is how they treat their loyal customers."
Ozgur,Gravesend,7/5/18,"Worst provider ever. internet drops out constantly, changed hub twice, speed is supposed to be 40mb but never get anything near that, around 5-10mb if lucky and now price is increasing for 2nd time in a 18 month contract. Know your rights, if they increase price mid-contract, you have the right to cancel. I am doing that and going to Virgin Media. At least its reliable internet."
Lee,WILLENHALL,7/4/18,BE WARNED!! Terrible service. If you like your broadband company to use sly strategies to get you to pay more then BT are for you. They send you an email about renewing your sports then in the small print they renew your broadband only to increase the cost by £20 a month later! Also they don't appreciate loyalty. I called about the £50 cost of my broadband and they said they cannot offer a better deal because the better deals are for new customers only. Absolutely con. STAY WELL CLEAR trust me!
aamina,Blairgowrie,7/3/18,just horrible. my internet is not working for 10 days now. I've been phoning them every day. they send me 4 engineers all of them were unavailable to fixed that problem.now when call them to cancel my contract they say I have to pay cancellation fee. I learned my lesson never going with bt again
CALLUM,crieff,7/3/18,Price rises with no escape unless you agree to contract renewal or accept the price rise. otherwise if your under contract you either accept the constant price rises or
Tom,York,7/3/18,"Rubbish, I was told this is the only internet I can have in my new build house. Had to pay more for worse internet than I had before. What a monopoly/scam they have going here.

I am using them as this is the only choice.
Scam!"
Robert Bickersteth,Central London,7/2/18,"The most horrendous experience I have had in 35 years of business. Our BT broadband was cut off after sevaral phone calls it transpired that someone unknown and completely unconnected to the business had been able to circumvent BT’s security and asked for the broadband to be terminated. I have spent over 9 hours over the last 5 days trying to get it reconnected. Despite BT admitting there had been a mistake and they are investigating my business has had no internet and as we have a VOIP phone system we had not had our telephone lines. I have made over 32 calls some lasting as long as 2 1/4 hrs (from which the so called manger responsible for sorting out the problems put the phone down on me principally as I had asked, for the fourth time, to speak her manager). Nobody is apparently remotely interested in resolvolving the issue and all this time my business is suffering. It is absolutely shocking they have a monopoly and behave like this despite it being their incompetence. I strongly urge anyone who reads this to never use BT Braoafbsnd if you can help it."
Simon,Winterton,7/2/18,Been having problems for a while now with my connection dropping out. Used there fault checker on the website. They found the fault and sent an engineer within the hour! WITHIN THE HOUR! new line installed and the cable put into a new place in my living room at my request. Now im not getting any drop outs. My speed has TRIPLED to within 5mb of the 80mb/s im paying for and upload is upto 20mb/s. All sorted and fixed within 4 hours of my initial problem. Cant fault that at all
Arthur,Norfolk,7/2/18,"I joined Bt placed order 17 February it took over a month install 5 appointments 3 engineer appointments till it was installed i got an offer from Money saving Expert Martin Lewis Fibre Broadband phone Tv £150 MasterCard £50 cheque cash back its Now July never got the cashback £50 got a Master card to the value of £110 contacted emailed phoned Bt 5 / 6 times or more they tel me their was no such offer i must be stupid when i placed the order i done a Screen capture on PC as proof of offer at the time
Any way 3 months later get email from BT my price is going up by £2.50 a month it was supposed to be fixed for 18 months not so say BT the price can go up any time i tell them i want to save money Sky Plusnet Vodafone have offers for £25 but bt offer me more expensive package their new super fibre £33.50 i dont want to pay more i want to save money and pay less Joining Sky for £25 38Mb fibre unlimited calls"
Jochen Losch,LONDON,7/2/18,"I am in my fifties, so I had a lot of contact with service providers during my life.
BT is the worst company ever. Their service quality is absolutely shocking.
It started with the installation a year ago. BT outsources everything to a company called Openreach. Those are guys who simply don't show up at agreed dates like 3 times in a row, and if you complain about it, you get even insulted over the phone for free.
Now have a problem during the contractual period like a non working phone line. There is no way to call BT (unless you want to spend money with them). No one will ever attend the phone, not even after one hour hearing an automated voice telling you ""your call is very important to us"". Then try to contract them online. Immediately a window will pop up saying ""some internal error ocurred"". That's it. In other words: Dear customer, go ""f.."" yourself.
Don't ever hire BT."
Keith,Formby,7/1/18,"Took out 18 month contract , broadband and phone , this included a reward card which I was told would be sent to me , nothing arrived I forgot about the card but had occasion to contact BT about a price increase this was also a surprise as I was also told that the price was fixed for the duration of the contract , not so said B T we reserve the right to increase your fees when we see fit . They also told me that as it was almost six months since I joined them the reward card was now out of time and they would not be sending one also I should have read the terms of the contract , this I'd probably right , but as I was told in the first instance that this would be forwarded to me I took it at face value . I asked for someone from that department to contact me but they totally ignored my request . This has left me with the impression that they do not value individual customers in the slightest , I do not think my association with B T will be permanent one."
mistarico,Glasgow,7/1/18,"Save Yourself!
These guys are unbelievable. How many BT employees does it take to install copper broadband to an existing line? 18 approximately. A total of 3 months only to find that the fibre I had been offered isn't available (although BT's systems say it is) so order cancelled and standard broadband offered, fibre offered a second time and again cancelled. Finally have standard broadband after hours on the phone to them. Was told several times to expect a call back the next day...never happened. Absolute worst service ever! Run away!!!"
Beckie,UK,6/30/18,"Absolute rubbish. Paying £57 a month and my internet doesn't even work. Used my 4G than ever since getting this pathetic internet, constantly going on and off, refreshing it self every 5 minutes and it's suppose to be the fastest and best internet? What ever. Sick of paying extra on my phone bill because the internet doesn't work for most of the time."
Will,Bristol,6/30/18,"I took out a new fibre contract in February 2018. The cost was £29.99 a month for 18 months. In June 2018, I received a letter informing me that my monthly payments would be increasing by £2.50 a month in Sptember 2028. This would increase my contract payment to £32.49 a month. The letter also included a weblink to a personalised offer. Following the weblink took me to an 'offer' that would allow me to keep my monthly payments at £29.99 a month, as long as I committed to a new 18 month contract. What a total scam BT. Essentially, they sign a new customer up to a new contract at an agreed price. Four months later, they send the new customer a letter attempting to pressure them into a new 18 month contract, or to have to pay more for their existing contract. I called BT customer services and politely explained that I was unhappy with their letter. I questioned why they were increasing my payments from £29.99 to £32.49, yet would be happy to keep them at £29.99 if I would sign a new 18 month contract with them. I explained that as a new customer, this felt like extortion. There was nothing they would do to help me, so I have no excercised my right to leave my existing contract due to a change of terms. I've now gone to Sky and got the same fibre deal for £25 a month. A saving of £7.50 a month once BT forced price change comes into effect. Thanks for nothing BT."

AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
Amy/mark Crofts,Manchester,6/29/18,"If I could it would be -* as your service has been absolutely shocking.I have never seen such bad customer service.

Move house -you don’t move us to a new address you cancel our account !!!!!.Then for weeks and weeks you keep cancelling the new set up of a new account t so nothing happened.Following on from this win no internet we run out of internet(3/4G) on our mobiles so you give us extra,suspissedlt free of charge but you put it on our bill so my husband had to cancel the direct debit otherwise you would have taken this from us.All of a sudden after waiting for calls you call to chase money that WE DONT OWE YOU!!!!.Funny how you call when you want money but when we need help we can’t get hold of anyone.Everytime you call that so called Case Manager isnt in!!!!.

You are now not calling us back yet again to sort the rest of the money on the account although you are messaging us threatening to cut us off.

Now if that’s what you call customer service then you need to close as a business.You have caused us nothing but a nightmare for the last 8 + weeks and still the so called case manager isn’t calling my husband back.

Get your business sorted as intended years ago with its customer service and call people back to sort their accounts.

We have everything with you and so wish we didn’t.You are have broken your part of the contract for numerous months and still can’t sort.

Thanks for nothing BT."

Sincity,greenwich,6/28/18,"AWFUL I have to call constantly because my internet stops working throughout the day. I have placed 2 complaints and have called about 4 -5 times this month. I was told that the issue is probably the hub and that I need to order a new contract to receive the hub, I already pay £70 a month for internet that does not work, I will not be tied into a new contract when im very unhappy with the service I currently have. I am expected to pay full price for a service I am not receiving. Not to mention the manager was supposed to call me 4 days ago and never did. The customer service is appalling, stay as far away as possible, this company over charges for products that do not work. STAY AWAYYYY"
Faiska,London,6/27/18,"Got BT broadband for the past 2 years. In the beginning everything was top. Broadband working fine. Smooth transition from TAlk talk but after I gave them 30days cancellation notice it has been the worst month ever. Broadband keeps dropping all the time. Customer service helpdesk waste of time. It has been crutical on my business as I have to be online all the time.
STAY AWAY FROM BT"

It makes me feel sick having to stay with BT due to family pressures for a minor sport that sold out to BT. More price rises announced today :("
Louisa,"ringwood, dorset",6/26/18,"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. We used BT years ago and were messed around so much that we had to get the ombudsman involved and then stopped using BT's services. A few years later...we moved into our house in Feb 2018. After being told by several people that BT were much better now and our new house was only fitted with a BT connection...we just decided it was easiest to use them again. Well, how wrong were we. Firstly they sold us a wrong package...unlimited broadband costs £30ish a month but they signed us up for limited broadband at the same price...and we went unknowing over every month being charged £90-£100. We put a complaint forward for this and they said it would be cancelled immediately and we would be put onto a the new package and sent a free of charge recording box for the inconvenience. Well 3 weeks later and no box..I contact them to be told that no package was cancelled and no new one ordered...meaning we were still being over charged. I spoke to about 6 different people who you had to explain the whole situation to again. 4 people cut me off on live chat and I had the phone put down on me once. Finally after weeks and weeks they have cancelled our packaged and put the new one in. They have offered us....£30 for the inconvenience!!!!?? What an insult. Will NEVER use this company again."
Ceri,Barry,6/24/18,"Can't speak to the broadband speed and reliability as it's not been activated yet, but I expect great things considering the extortionate activation fees they're charging us.

We've moved into a new build home, and due to BT's monopoly on the area are unable to go with any other provider. Not only are their broadband deals more expensive than anyone else's, we have to pay £70 in various upfront costs. Absolutely disgusted. They're at liberty to charge whatever they want because there's no competition - the alternative is to not have internet for a year. Wondering if there's recourse to go to the Financial Ombudsman about this."

hayley,sussex,6/22/18,"Joined BT from sky on the 23rd April, smooth transition over. However on the 5th June after numerous phone calls to BT about broadband dropping out, not having the channels I was promised and the telephone not working, they said I could cancel penalty free due to being miss-sold. I was offered a good deal with sky therefore I went back. Sky sent me an email on the 5th June telling me that my SKY TV was active and they were doing a working line takeover of my phone number and broadband on the 19th June. BT sent me an email to tell me that my services were ending on the 12th June. I rang sky to make sure the 19th was the correct date and then called BT. BT said that there was no active line takeover and told me to call sky again, I called sky, and they said 100% that they were taking over on the 19th June. I called back BT who again said that this was not the case. They told me to call sky again, which I stupidly did who told me the same thing. I called back BT and they said what they would do is cancel that cancellation of my services for the 12th June and keep them running until the 19th June when I would need to call up and cancel (penalty free still) and they would refund me my money for this month. After checking my BT I could see that this was not done so I called BT again and said its still not cancelled, I kept getting told by different agents (always a different one every time I called, apologising and saying the last advisor was rubbish and that they are amazing and will get this sorted, none did) that the cancellation of the cancellation was done and that my services would continue. On the 12th June, I woke up to find my broadband had gone off. I called BT straight away who apologised that the agent before had not cancelled the cancellation properly so my TV and phone line were still active but broadband wasn’t. They then proceeded to tell me that I could get the broadband turned back on but it would take 2 weeks. Which was ridiculous given that telling them 15 times and it being in my notes that sky were taking over on the 19th.

So I was without broadband for a week until sky took over. I received a call on the 20th telling me that something had gone wrong and bt was saying that I still had my phone line with them, despite sky having it. He said he would have to send it to the off line team to cancel and that I would get a call on Friday telling me that everything had been cancelled down properly and I would have a refund for the month of services I did not have.

However! I wake Friday to 3 emails from BT at 5am!!!! First at 5:20am saying thanks for choosing bt there is an update to your order. My calling plan for the phone will start on the 22nd June for a years contract (WTF!) and will cost £21.99 a month (HUH!)
Second at 5:21am asking me to return my bt equipment as I don’t need it anymore.
Third at 5:21am telling me that my bt service is ending sorry to see me go. (this is just for the TV that I haven’t had since the 5th June)."
Kevin,Bristol,6/21/18,"Broadband: Over the course of 12 months with BT Broadband we had outages roughly once per month. Additionally, every weekend at some point as well as random other times the service would drop to a very low download speed (1-2mbps). So, it failed to meet speed and reliability expectations/promises.

Customer Service: When switching providers we wanted a slightly earlier date than the end of 12 months (already paid the full 12) because it was easier for us. BT informed us we'd be charged an extra £63.40 even though we paid for 12 months. When I called to try and sort this out I spoke with two people who both told me they weren't actually sure what the final bill would look like and couldn't tell me if there'd be more or less charges until the account was closed. So literally I could be charged £0 or I could be charged an unknown amount and I won't know until I have no way to change that. Terrible customer service. Go with Sky, or honestly anyone other than BT."
alex,brighton,6/20/18,"i am lucky to be able to write this review as i have a 5 minute window of being online before my BT broadband drops out again.

I have been with BT for about a year in a property and they have sent about 10 engineers, ive called them about 50 times and still i cant even send an email without it cutting out.

when i try to call up to downgrade the guy on the phone tries to sell me a higher priced product and tells me that new customers are higher priority.

I then ask to cancel the TV package and only use the broadband (so i dont waste as much money as i do now) and he asks me why. I then say that i prefer to use netflix and he asks why and tries to upgrade the package again.

I would highly avoid this company - load of rubbish."

DavidM,Whitehaven,6/19/18,Sainsbury's Gift Card never arrived and they were appalling when I contacted Customer Services. Dreadful Indian Call centre. Junk mail pushing BT Sport every two or three weeks. Prices exploded as soon as contract up. Just spotted small print with days to go I had to opt out not in to BT Sport after free 6 months. Broadband itself was good but when it cut out it was down for hours rather than minutes. I went with them as I needed a new line installing in a new place and they were cheapest for that. But left as soon as contract was up and woukd never go back based on Call Centre service and Gift Card con.
Ian McGeechan,Ayr,6/18/18,"got fibre ￡34 per month,worked well for 3 weeks then speed dropped drastically.Bt have fobbed me off for months now and with no real help.My old standard plusnet was better value.This has been their 2nd chanece,I will never use them again"

Davidson2,Argyll,6/16/18,"I transferred to BT Mobile after 14 years with Three. Not only did I get a cheaper deal, but the 4G average is 97mbps compared to Three’s 53mbps. I honestly thought that all providers used the same masts. I’ve had 2 issues with 2 calls to knowledgeable people in the UK! What a difference not having to repeat myself again and again. Both calls were answered quickly and sorted in a single call. I have signed up for BT Plus and Broadband speed is decent for my area. Having double my mobile plan means for workers from home I can tether to my iPhone and get websites uploaded 700% quicker. I still believe the fixed line could be quicker, but overall, very good to have a British brand firmly back in Britain!"

BT have been overcharging my granddad who has dementia and knows no better for a substandard copper broadband package. He's been getting charged over 100 pound a month for a package you can pick up for under 40 pound from themselves. Safe to say I have cancelled it and will never use BT as long as I live."
Christine,Bradforf,6/14/18,After several calls to chase up a broadbabd fault on Sunday now being told they need to send me a new Hub and that could take 5 days! No reasoning with any of the advisers. Engineer came out this morning reported we needed new router but still hadn't been auctioned when I rang to chase up! In the middle of a house move can't action e mails or transfer monies do they care no they don't. Bet if I rang up as a new customer they'd use next day delivery to get my router to me . It appears that those of us who've been with them for many years get poorer service for our loyalty . Adviser told me once problem was fixed I 'wouldn't regret sticking with BT '. Yes what I'm moving house and there are plenty of other providers in the market place.
Egle B.,MANCHESTER,6/14/18,"If you value your health then don't get into a contractual obligation with these guys. They will hang up on you if they don't like what you are complaining about, they will tell you they'll fix your broadband speed because you've been put on the wrong plan (a cheaper one of course) but they won't, they'll tell you that you'll get a rebate but you won't, they'll tell you they'll call you back but they won't. The most appalling service of all, you will get. They organisation is so chaotic that nobody knows what they're talking about are and everybody is just trying to blag it. One guy kept repeating that my speed is measured in Megabytes/s and another was making drawing comparisons between my 2 years old telephone filter and a 16 years old girl which is supposedly better than a 60 years old women (not sure in what sense)!"
JohnC,"Keysoe, Bedfordshire",6/14/18,"BT Infinity in Postcode MK44 2__ is not workable. The lines from the Cabinet are not only too long to provide Superfast Broadband, the copper is too thin. Can't even support 10Mbps Standard Broadband yet BT will tell you that between 10 and 19Mbps Download is achievable. The BT App asserts that their SpeedTester is the best at assessing line speeds and network capability. Does not compute. OFCOM are paper tigers."
Sue,Uxbridge,6/13/18,"BT customer service is rubbish. I have been without email for almost 2 weeks, have spent hours on the phone over the past 10 days speaking to one call centre or another and been fobbed off each time. Just do what you promise - if you say you are going to resolve my problem and call me back at a specific time then do it! I still have no email after speaking to yet another ‘help’ line person this afternoon who told me there was a problem, I am aware of this but no one seems to know what the problem is or how or when it can be resolved. I am waiting in again for yet another call tomorrow which may or may not happen; if it does then I am pretty sure that my problem will not be resolved. I am paying for a service that I am not receiving and this is unacceptable- do not use them! I have put my email in so that I can submit this review but it is not working - ask BT why!"
S,Gloucestershire,6/12/18,"Failed to install on the day, ended up with no landline, no broadband for 4 days. Only got it fixed after numerous calls and finally exploding - 15 mins later it works. I register a complaint and I start to get texts from Indian sounding names to my daughters BT mobile (she's 11) about the complaint. I reply to tell them not to use an underage girls number...they send another to that number. In the end I call them and spend an hour to get a miserly £20 back for forf the trouble and a total refusal to reduce a £59 connection fee i.e. it's fine that I should pay full for a botched service and any losses incurred as a result are my problem, they don't care. Also they have totally lost any record that I should have got reward vouchers so I should kiss goodbye to that part of the offer I signed on for. The customer service is shocking. If you want to listen to 'unfortunately' and other trained platitudes but a refusal to do anything, please give them a call. I only moved from Sky as they kept sneaking the price up and at one point even charged me for not having their TV service...so thought i'd try BT. All as bad as each other."
Kevin,East ham,6/10/18,"Crap service. My broadband Connection was down for last 17 days and not fixed yet. Yesterday one of the service manager told me it will take another 30 days to be fixed. They want me to pay the bill for last month (for the service that I didn’t receive) I asked to end the contract , they transferred me to a lady from UK office, she threatened me saying if I wanna leave the contract I need to pay £150 + bill. After 1 hour argument I was transferred to a manager. She very simply told me “I don’t know when the network issue will be fixed, According to your contract if you wanna leave us before the contract ends you need to pay £150 if you fail , we will take legal action. Also, she said not to call them back again with the same issue which they been aware of, they will inform me once it’s fixed. There a few essential gadgets in my home need internet connection, ex (my mother’s medical equipment) I asked BT at least to provide me with a temporary dongle so my mother’s medical machines can work. The answer from BT was “sorry we can’t”. Don’t use this company or any of their services."
Emily fullalove,Preston,6/10/18,"BT is absolutely terrible! We have not been with them any more than 5 months and in that time we have gone through 3 hubs , about 30 phone calls to get the WiFi back on and an under qualified idiot who decides to stick a giant cable through our wall which knocked the front of some of our bricks off!!!!!! I am a teen who has loads of school work to do and for most of it I need the internet, BUT GUESS WHAT....I DONT HAVE ANY INTERNET"
Jon,Lincoln,6/9/18,"An absolutely awful company to deal with. I changed to them for their TV and broadband package only after they offered to buy out the remainder of my contract with my existing provider. On swapping, I found out that I was tied in to a contract with my previous provider, so I decided not to go ahead but after informing them they offered to buy out the remainder of the contract and sent confirmation to me that they would do this... then once they had taken over the supply they refused to credit my account. They are not replying to any of my emails now and they won't provide a reference number that I can give to Ofcom to take this further, as they are required to do. I will try to get what I can back from Ofcom but if that doesn't work I will just reclaim six months payments back, which is the maximum I can under the Direct Debit guarantee and walk away. DO NOT TRUST BT!!! Utterly useless!"
Jason,Bath,6/9/18,Ordered a change of address. Two months later and still they haven't moved it. I'm being forced to pay for a service that I cannot use because they are so completely incompetent when you speak to them. Spoken to over 10 advisors who have said a variety of excuses. They don't call you back or give any update. I've never had such a poor experience in my entire life.
Trevor,Leicestershire,6/8/18,"I have had very poor service and have considered moving but reading the comments on here about other providers, it seems the whole industry needs dragging into this century. Have now decided to stay with BT for a while and make a damned nuisance to get my own back for the wasted time and aggravation they have caused me."
Jordan,Stoke-on-Trent,6/7/18,"Absolutely disgraceful. After ringing up many of times about the internet speed and nothing being changed and being told it is fine. I decided to ring up yesterday with customer services putting the phone down after about 20 seconds. But I can say the internet is down more than it is on and would not recommend even if it was free!! Losing internet connection constantly. The worst broadband out there, really is disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!"
No,,6/7/18,
Harvey,LONDON,6/6/18,Do not use BT! They charge too much money for an awful service that constantly cuts out. We have been sent 3 replacement routers and NONE of them work. After 5 minutes of using the WiFi the hub decides to restart. Don't even get me started on the weakness of the hub. The speed is dreadful. I can't even stream a 720p HD video without it buffering every few seconds. The customer service is appalling. Don't even bother trying them. Save yourself heartbreak: go for ANY other provider.

Elliot marsh,Lancashire,6/5/18,
Valerie Aylett,"Broadstairs, Kent.",6/4/18,"The week before I reported my issue with BT on the 21st of May I was experiencing slow internet, and constant dropping of internet. The internet was dropping out of connection constantly, and when connected was very slow. The dropping out meant that we could barely use the internet to do anything but browse internet at times. The internet was absolutely dreadful.

After we finally reported the issue I encountered the worse customer service I have ever experienced. I first used the online BT Live Chat where I had been talking to technicians about my issues, and how to solve them. The problem was, the technicians were constantly closing the chat and ending the conversation before I got anywhere.

Eventually I get through to someone decent and have an engineer booked for the 22nd, which is great. But the engineer comes out and finds nothing wrong with the internet in the house, and tells us to ring up BT and tell them this. We report this to BT and they tell us they will have ‘higher-ups’ look at the problem to try sort it out, after waiting two days. They tell us when they are going to ring, but it is a time we cannot do. But we cannot rearrange the call because texting is going to charge us money. So, we try to be free around the time, but cannot get to the phone after they ring twice. And tell us they will ring the next day. This time we can be at the phone, so on the call, he tells us that the technicians are still looking into the problem.
Eventually, they agree to send out another technician and on the 30th of May, from 1pm – 6pm. They completely just miss this appointment and do not inform us of why. We then get a ring the next day to rebook the appointment on the 2nd of June, the engineer then comes in and finds three different faults with the hardware in the home. Which I don’t know how the first engineer didn’t find.
So, after this terrible experience for a service we are currently paying for £70 a month for, and it not being usable for more than half the month, BT ring up to discuss compensation and offer £14 for the fault and another £5 on top as a goodwill gesture. This is an absolute joke of a refund, after nearly 3 weeks of unusable internet and then horrendous customer services £20 is nothing.

We will certainly be looking to cancel our BT contract as soon as we can and would advise no-one else to get a contract with them."
Mike D,Altrincham,6/4/18,"We moved into a new address and services were scheduled to start 24/5/18 but actually started 4/6/18 because BT did not swop the line over to our name.No TV,phone broadband etc unable to use laptop or printer etc only irritating texts asking if we were happy wit our new service.Phone caller from BT addressed me by my first name which I don’t like and at age 66 find patronising.Avoid BT"

Philip,Thundersley,6/2/18,"Just learnt have been out of contract for 2 years and paying the standard fees and at not time being notifired of comming out of contract

Complained and got a standard letter telling me the terms and conditions of the contract only

Tried to negotiate a new package and the difference was £5.00 reduction from my original cost of the broadband and I had to keep my old hub which is 5 years old

Caller seemed to think the cost compared with Plusnet was down to spead so if you have to wait a couple of seconds more for a £12 saving thats no problem plus some benifits including a price freeze over the term of the contract

Surly if you are in contract thats the price you pay over the term of the contract obviously not as I was advised it can be put up with out warning

Been with BT 35 years no point in being loyal"
J Evans,London UK,5/31/18,"Internet speed is fine, but drops out randomly for anything from a few seconds to a few hours. This can happen very frequently.

This is especially annoying if you're playing a video game and the whole game freezes leaving you powerless to react."
Thomas,LONDON,5/31/18,"Stay away from BT! They couldn't install it, when they ""did"" it cut out for hours & days at a time for the 2 months I suffered them & was slower than sky copper wire broadband. When I cancelled it because they weren't fixing it they want you to pay up the remainder of bill, for a service that doesn't work?! Worst company I've ever dealt with in every aspect. Begging you to all stay away. Please, I don't want anyone else to suffer the same stress. Go with sky cheapest broadband. Going on 5 years I've used them in total & never cuts out n cheap. Avoid BT, you have been warned. PS, non existent customer service, shockingly bad. U think they have SOME customer service, they have NONE! They lure u in & then ur on ur own. Disgusting company & I hope karma is harsh on them."
Lewis,Ditchling,5/30/18,"Bt broadband is great, we have been promised fibre optics for 3 years, and still don’t have it, it goes at 0.3mbps, which sometimes goes upto 1mbps if we are lucky, it has only been down 3 times in the past 2 weeks and has been repaired twice, but still goes down each time after, we pay twice as much as people getting internet that is 200 times the speed. That is why I love BT broadband, thank you for taking the time to read how much I love it."
Stephen kendall,Bradford,5/30/18,Once more we have no phone or internet. Last month it was off for 5 days. We have had continuous problems for the past 3 years. 3 New routers several engineers visits and they still cannot sort it. Rubbish service. Now another 2 days before back on. Not happy at all. Will not be having bt when we move
John,Leicester,5/29/18,"Really awful customer service from a company that seems incapable of ever getting it right.
I ordered an iPhone, and they sent two. They seemed to think it appropriate for me to do the running around to sort out their mistake. As part of this transaction they convinced me to upgrade my broadband. I told them that they had made a right mess of the original installation and that if they were sure that they could do it properly, then OK. They made a right mess it with the excuse that a process had failed. For a technology and communications company they are laughable."
Ian,Burntisland,5/29/18,"Switched from SKY to BT, WORST mistake ever.Same problems as other comments such as we need to send an engineer as the problem is at my end. That was just a week after installation. Changed back to SKY never had a problem since. They also charged me for canceling my contract early for something they could not supply. Very rude and useless customer service."

Sian,Wales,5/23/18,I HATE BT SO MUCH!!! Its so slow and when the Bt man came to my house to check the speed he made it even worse. Its a massive waste of money and I would recommend you to never ever use your money on Bt because its trash!!!
Charles,London,5/22/18,"I play video games during my spare time and I have several devices connected at once with no drop in speed, I am able to download large video game files from my ps4 very fast, I am shocked everyone else on these sites give BT stick for little problems that cab be solved easily, the engineer for me came earlier than was meant to, I even got sent a second router as a spare, any queries I have I phone up and get assistance instantly with very polite customer service, I cant be more thankful to BT, People should 100% give BT a go, Infinity 2 package is the dream."
Greg,Tarrant Rushton,5/21/18,"I switched from Sky to BT after 2 years of good service with Sky for what I thought was a better deal and had a 3 month nightmare as the connection failed every few days for 1 or more days and I spent hours on the phone while they tested the line only to conclude every time that there was a problem at my property and they would have to send an engineer out. When the engineer came he could find no problem, but more often than not the service resumed again and they said there was a problem at the exchange which they had just fixed. They sent me a new router after one call saying the problem was with that but it was not. Meantime when the service was working the download speed was always abysmal, which they said was because it was over the phone line and 3 miles from the exchange, but I countered that with Sky I had 2 years of good bandwidth as well as zero service interruption. After 3 months I got them to agree that the service was inadequate and I am currently exiting the 2 year £30 per month contract with them to go back to Sky, which will cost me £35 for broadband and TV. Interestingly BT are also playing a game in these contracts where they say 'up to' a certain speed but when the service is crap they say that contractually there is no minimum bandwidth agreement. They could have held me to contract on that basis but as it happened I also had the zero service days, which they couldn't duck out of. In my opinion you should avoid BT, and in my case it was only the hotspot nearby that kept me connected most of the time at all, though that service itself would come and go. Luckily I was not working from home otherwise it would have been very difficult and I would have spent a lot of money getting data through my mobile provider. BT? Never again thanks."
Alex,Erith,5/21/18,"Hi everyone,

I signed up to BT fibre broadband in August 2017 in what otherwise seemed a smooth transfer which took just over 2 weeks to complete - a very good sign you'd say. Within two weeks after the service started, I started experiencing drops in connection every evening with router blinking amber, fluctuating connection speed and juddering video/gaming. So I reported my fault with BT helpline (which is based overseas, so often understanding them was an issue in itself) and the saga began. Instead of calling an engineer, BT kept resetting my router and sending me ""helpful tips"" how to make my broadband better - which worked for probably 30 mins, sometimes even less. Having called them for approximately 20 times (and each call was taking no less than 30 minutes), I finally managed to convince the customer service representative to call the engineer - guess what, she never called one in, although it was promised. Later on, I was promised a wifi booster and a 15m cable to rectify the issues - they have never been sent to me. I was also promised that I will receive refund for these months when I had no quality connection. Finally, in the end Dec 2017, fed up with non-existent quality and constantly dropping connection I threatened to leave - at which point BT customer service managed to call the engineer in who came in around 7th of January and identified the problem with the BT exchange, after which the connection was okay, albeit not perfect.

A couple of days ago I called BT and asked whether they refunded me for three months of no connection and my pain and time spent on the phone with them - I reckon about 25 hours by that time. In response, I was told that they could give me £10 as a goodwill gesture as they apparently cannot refund monthly fees past 120 days(!).

Over past 10 years or so I've been a customer of O2, Sky and Plusnet, but at no point I had such a dreadful combination of poor connection, incompetent customer service and false promises.

I will be taking this to the ombudsman to make sure this experience is heard and appropriate action is taken.

My takeaway is - if you keen to spend hours of your precious time on the phone and get no result - sign up to BT broadband. Otherwise steer clear."

Salar Mahmood,Burton on Trent,5/15/18,"BT is the worst service provider I ever dealt with. I am paying for nothing, Although, I have a BT broadband at home, but I have to connect my PC to my phones network using personal Hotspot. I have been with them for more than two and half years, they not letting me to leave their rubbish service, they have a very bad customer services they do not care about their customer, they looks they know nothing about the service except that related to money. They over charge their customer without letting them know, they should understand people are not free to phone them up frequently asking foe explanations and reporting problems. last week I phoned them many times reporting problems and overcharging. They are a big lair, they told me that the engineer will come on Saturday to fix the problem, I was waiting him all the day, but he did not come, when I phoned them, they said he came on Friday and he fixed the problem, but actually I have not noticed any improvement, I gave them few weeks time, but it still as it was, when I asked them to resend the engineer they said they will charge 120 pounds.
Eventually, I am still paying for nothing in addition to wasting my time and making me angry and depressed."
Vijaya Koganti,Dartford,5/15/18,I had been with BT for 5+ years. Their service was alright as long as you paid them. When I tried leaving them they threatened me with a £400 fine. I pleaded with them saying that the only reason I am leaving them is because their Internet broadband is very slow in my new property after I moved house. They refused to listen. They constantly threaten over the phone. I have now opened a case with the ombudsman. I have learnt that it takes 8 weeks before Ombudsman opens a case against BT so I am patiently waiting without giving up. I have since moved to Virgin and their internet connection is so fast! Wish I had moved away earlier.

-grace"
Darren,Dartf,5/15/18,"Absolutely terrible service. From what used to be a very reliable brand, this is now one of the worst. For the past 4 years I have had nothing but issues with BT broadband. Along with BT Sport my month bill is just shy of £70 per MONTH! With that I get a maximum speed of around 4mbs. That is a 10th of what it should be. I am constantly resetting the router.

Whenever I call(ed) BT I get a foreign call centre and have a lot of trouble understanding what they are saying. They take me through troubleshooting steps, which I know and memorised. When they get to the end of the steps they advise me about sending an engineer out at a cost of around £100 (if the fault is that of my own). I have since started a new broadband contract with Sky (who I know aren't the greatest - but surely cannot be worse?) I have managed to reduce my monthly combined bill of TV+Broadband by almost £50 per month.

I am so fed up of BT. Overpriced, overhyped and just plain thieves."
Barry,Carrickfergus,5/14/18,"Having been a customer with bt for several years, I've finally lost all patience with their unreliable broadband and poor customer service. I wouldn't normally be leaving such a poor review but the last straw was when they cut my broadband off a day earlier than agreed, and after trying for over an hour to get the issue sorted with their customer service team I gave up. Throughout my broadband contract I noticed a definite drop in speeds at peak times, to the extent that basic online music and videos would be continuously interrupted despite me subscribing to their fastest, unlimited package. Numerous contacts with their customer service was unable to fix this so i gave up.
When the time came to renew I was unable to avail of the online offers available so my package would cost nearly twice as much as a new customer. What a way to reward loyalty!
I will not be returning to bt as a customer in the future and would advise others to stay well clear."
Nicola,London,5/14/18,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. We set up a cloud phone with bt. We then discovered bt internet was not available in our area. We cancelled but they kept charging us for over a year, we spent hours on the phone. We originally ported our number to bt from talk talk. After trying to port our number to a new service that could run with fibre optic they would not allow us to have our phone number back which we have been using for 6 years. Again we spent hours on the phone along with our new supplier trying to get the number. I even had one of the team members laugh done the phone at me. They have been holding our number ransom ever since. This service has been disgraceful. Avoid BT like the plague. Cannot stress this enough."
Yolande Smith,Cambridge,5/14/18,Broadband and mobile phone reliable. Poor customer contact.
Stella Murray,Reading,5/13/18,"BT have been absolutely awful for the past year, both in terms of wifi connection and actual customer service. We are a group of 4 students and more often than not we cannot have more than 2 of us using the wifi. Their customer service is absolutely appalling and it is very clear they do not care about their customers one bit. They were meant to return after they tried to install the broadband and realised they couldn't not install it properly as they could not access the required room but then never returned. Since then we have reported issues on numerous occasions, and on one of these occasions they said they would send an engineer out the next day, which never happened. When asked about it it turned out they hadn't communicated between themselves and the required engineer. In the past 24 hours we were promised a phone call back at 5pm which never happened, to which our account holder rang them and once again they didn't have a note of this. The man she spoke to said he would call her back in 5minutes which once again, never happened. It is absolutely ridiculous how little they care about their customers and how time and time again they attempt to charge us extra just for them to actually do their job correct. They frequently try to play the ""number of devices"" card against us but considering the wifi is awful even when there are only 2 of us in the house or if one individual using the internet at like 2am this is definitely not the case. We struggle to access our university website and use articles that are required for our assessments and this should not be the case. Do not go with BT. Last year I was with plusnet, paying far less, with the same number of people/devices in the house and getting far better connection."

I am happy i saw that, because from now on will take more serious the reviews...


BT I had worst experiences from them. They just interested in closing open tickets, the funny part is - their website test always show your connection is stable, (just imagine when your connection is dropped you will not be able to perform test so you can’t test and when you are on, you will test and it always show stable connection!!!) i am having broadband connection dropping issues from last few months and they are not able to fix it after so many complaints (i have many complaints raised!!!), official complaint also doesn’t make any difference to them, recently i have called them to cancel service and told them i am moving to another service provider, the person whom i was talking was only interested in telling me how other service provider is not good rather than listening me what problems i am having and how to resolve it, the reason i think they are not losing anything so they don’t care about customer. And if this is the attitude they have I rather take 2nd grade broadband services from other service provider that listens and care about customers rather than arrogant provider like BT, and I am sure there will be many-many customers who will think this way and one day BT will feel impact. couldn't provide us with a stable and good quality wireless connection even though I am sitting and working on a computer 5m away from the BT box and there are no obstacles between us. If they told me immediately that they can guarantee ONLY CABLE connection I would have made my decision but instead they kept on connecting me from one call centre to the other and I kept on spending hours talking to, sometimes very kind but powerless advisors but sometimes to very manipulative and limiting advisors. In 6 MONTHS on the phone with BT I spent hours trying to make BT broadband work decently but in the end, it DIDN""T. In the end they offered me 30 pounds to, practically shut up or find another provider but they wouldn't let me out of the contract. They wanted me to pay up until the end of the contract. INCOMPETENT CROOKS!"
D W L,Cornwall,5/12/18,"Paying for Infinity - actualy getting Infinity some of the time, have contacted BT, however speed always improves for a while when BT contacted., then variable again."
G,G,5/12/18,"I've had many connections before this one and out of all of them BT is defiantly the worst. When first looking at the connection it looked like a big upgrade from the other connections I’ve had in the past, but it was a complete lie. Although the connection is reasonably fast most of the time, it shuts down and has trouble connecting at the worst of times which is 10x worse considering I’m an avid gamer. Even fixing the connection is more trouble than its worth with it taking about half an hour to get it back up and working properly again. The amount of inconvenience this broadband has caused me is unbelievable and I recommend looking for literally any other service provider."
Masud,Birmingham,5/11/18,WiFi drops out every time it rains and is unreliable. It's been 5 months and it's still not fixed.
keith,Edinburgh,5/11/18,"Tried to switch to paperless billing as BT charges £2.50 per month for paper bills. Went online, clicked the option to switch billing method yet the paper bills and charges keep on coming. Have to call every month to get them to credit the charge but they seem incapable or unwilling to fix this problem."
Sergey,London,5/9/18,"First of all, read reviews on different sites before switching to BT! You will very likely decide not to!

Their service is not great, streaming freezes, Wi-Fi signal is bad, but the most ridiculous thing is that when you move you get totally ripped off. They promote a smooth free move on their official site (https://www.productsandservices.bt.com/manage/moving-home/), which reads ""No connection fee or new Direct Debits to arrange"" and when it comes to an actual move, it turns out that they will charge you 130 pounds of connection fee.
And after they tricked you into 18 months contract, you have a choice of either paying a connection fee of 130 pounds or 6 months of your contract as an early cancellation fee (for me 36*6=216 pounds)."
Ben J,Manchester,5/8/18,"Why didn’t I read these reviews first. The broadband service is the worst I have ever experienced. Slow connection, poor wireless range, constantly drops the connection. I’ve been over 24 hours without a connection once but BT denied there was an issue. The Home Hub is probably the worst piece of kit I have ever used, not does it work with any decent router in modem only mode. Plus not compatible with Apple AirPort Extreme or Express. I tried to cancel my account just outside 14 days and they said it would cost me nearly £900 in fees, despite me having first reported the problems inside the 14 days. They are truely truely terrible and I can’t wait for the day I can leave them for good. Please don’t be tempted by any of their deals as it really isn’t worth the pain."
SierraRomeo,"Aston, Henley-on-Thames",5/4/18,Where ever I go in my day I have pretty reliable service on my phone be it 4G or work broadband. I come home and I have to wait for everything I need to do online. I’m on the fastest BT ranking but cannot change it due to its Connection to a business account. I always know I’m getting close to home or I’m on the home broadband because my phone slows down. Not only that I get the joy of casually of having to wait for my Rueter to reboot for five times in one evening. Favourite thing when that happens. I sometimes switch my phone to 4G from my own Wi-Fi connection because it’s faster.
Mavena,March,5/3/18,"Horrendous company, all they care about is getting you to close off your complaint. The BT tv box and service is terrible, there broadband is slow there customer service is absolutely ridiculous . They are the worst company I have had any dealings with , by far . Terrible terrible terrible."
Neil,Hinckley,5/3/18,"I have been with BT now for 3 months on the 76 mbps fibre package and are more than happy with their service. I have constantly checked speeds and all are in excess of 72 mbps, no matter what time of day. I had one minor issue with the landline at the start, however this was resolved quickly and easily. I have previously had fibre contracts with Plusnet (quite good although streaming tended to stutter) and Vodafone (avoid!). BT are not the cheapest but I firmly believe that you get what you pay for. Overall I am very satisfied with BT fibre."
william capewell,Tipton,5/2/18,Bt told me and sent me my speed would be no less than 42 mb download speed its only 13.4 whats going on phone customer service said you are on wireless my wife is the same she is on cable he is having a joke. BT sort it or i am off.
Lucy Clarke,Welshpool,5/2/18,"VERY unhappy with BT, 3 times arranged for an engineer to come out to my house to solve a problem and ALL 3 times I have received a text message the day before saying they and found and RESOLVED the problem. Which after ALL 3 times the internet still has been the same. UNFORTUNETLY BT is the only broadband I can get in my area or I would have changed by now. BT I hope you read this and good luck getting a payment from me untill my internet is sorted."
Jordan Neale,Tipton,5/1/18,Always turning off and is never up to the normal speed

Steve Major,South Derbyshire,5/1/18,"Set up a house move well in advance
It failed and 5 days later and many many calls and promises that my service and connection will be live soon

Still nothing
Every day I am phoning and promises made again
But nothing again!!!!
I phone again (now 5 days after failed connection) to be promised a case manager to get my connection planned and told me a set up call planned later today

And failed no call
Today told oh sorry it’s been moved as call 72 hours away"
Vipin,Wokingham,4/30/18,"Rubbish services, it wasn’t like this before 4-5 months (at least broadband speed was good), suddenly their broadband service is degraded; customer service of complaint & technical teams - I had worst experiences from them. They just interested in closing open tickets, the funny part is - their website test always show your connection is stable, (just imagine when your connection is dropped you will not be able to perform test so you can’t test and when you are on, you will test and it always show stable connection!!!) i am having broadband connection dropping issues from last few months and they are not able to fix it after so many complaints (i have many complaints raised!!!), official complaint also doesn’t make any difference to them, recently i have called them to cancel service and told them i am moving to another service provider, the person whom i was talking was only interested in telling me how other service provider is not good rather than listening me what problems i am having and how to resolve it, the reason i think they are not losing anything so they don’t care about customer. And if this is the attitude they have I rather take 2nd grade broadband services from other service provider that listens and care about customers rather than arrogant provider like BT, and I am sure there will be many-many customers who will think this way and one day BT will feel impact."
Adelina,Manchester,4/28/18,"Just rubbish internet. Very low speed, stops working every 15 minutes (I have to constantly reconnect, restart my router etc) and the customer service is horrendous. They also randomly up the price on the contract without letting you know. DO NOT USE THEM."

Vijaya Koganti,Bexley,4/26/18,I have been with BT for over 8 years. My issues began when I tried to leave them. They threatened me with a £400 fine for breaking contract. In the end I had to write to the top officials in BT to get my contract cancelled without a fine. I am with Virgin now and a much happier customer.
T Jones,London,4/25/18,"Extremely poor customer service, ridiculously slow connection, seemingly impossible to speak with anyone that can resolve an issue.

For your own sanity, don't even consider BT."
Suzie,Chester,4/23/18,"My experience is that BTs customer service is shocking in fact it is non existent. I have recently switched to them for fibre bb and they have not fulfilled their promises despite much time spent chasing. Judging by all the negative reviews on here, im not the only one that is disappointed with them but they seem to have a dont care attitude!"
Gary Ryan,Great Yarmouth,4/22/18,"As broadband providers go, BT is really not that bad. The router they supply is pretty good and is dual band so currently using the 5ghz band and get an excellent wi-fi signal."
Tatiana,"Fulham, London",4/20/18,"BT couldn't provide us with a stable and good quality wireless connection even though I am sitting and working on a computer 5m away from the BT box and there are no obstacles between us. If they told me immediately that they can guarantee ONLY CABLE connection I would have made my decision but instead they kept on connecting me from one call centre to the other and I kept on spending hours talking to, sometimes very kind but powerless advisors but sometimes to very manipulative and limiting advisors. In 6 MONTHS on the phone with BT I spent hours trying to make BT broadband work decently but in the end, it DIDN""T. In the end they offered me 30 pounds to, practically shut up or find another provider but they wouldn't let me out of the contract. They wanted me to pay up until the end of the contract. INCOMPETENT CROOKS!"
Pete,East Yorks,4/17/18,"BT Group (the holding company which also includes Plusnet and EE) is a virtual monopoly that has very poor customer service coupled with a company that couldn't care less. The website is a complicated mess that hides what you want to find out. It is deliberately designed to sell you more and pretend they're great. ??
I've had price hikes that I could not get out of and problems with speed - a problem that I gave up on because all the solutions were duff.
Cheating BT. Thankfully everyone knows how poor they are now."
Siva,Herts,4/17/18,"I tried for the last 2 days to place a fibre broadband talking to the sales team over the phone as well as doing it online. On all my attempts I was told either that it isn't available in my area or BT has a system issue with checking. Today I see that they have put the prices up. When again I did online chat as well as talking on the phone after going being passed to 4 BT customer team members eventually I went to BT assist team and then told that I could have the fibre but need to pay the increased new price.Eventhough I have evidence to support (chat emails) that it was their system and online form issue stopped me from having it at lower price, the BT team wasn't interested listen and was more or less telling that it was my fault. My experience with BT on this occasion was terrible I won't recommend them for anyone."
Diana Smith,Derby,4/17/18,
Kelseyoh,Barrow-in-furness,4/17/18,Woul not come back to BT if you paid me. Shocking in every aspect. They don't even understand their own bills and make charges up as they go along. Avoid if you can!
Eric Strudwick,Essex,4/16/18,"Having recently upgraded to BTinfinity, the guest wifi service is terrible. Only when you set up the guest wifi will you see it is branded BT, NOT your company. But using it is awful, even if you want to only use email, users must open a web page of BT advertising before getting a connection.

ALSO, I had a technical problem, but BT would not help because we did not have the account number. AND we could not get the account number until BT generated and sent the first bill.

How stupid could they be?????"
sam,dorset,4/16/18,"absolutely disgusting customer service, taking over a month to speak to appropriate people within organisation due to poor service in the first place. Get the feeling they are taking customers for granted!"
Lena,,4/16/18,"I had BT for a month,I received first bill with EXTRA charges £190 only god knows what for, straight cancelled what cost me £500, avoid BT seriously"
Sam,Rhoose,4/16/18,"I'm currently with talktalk at 76mbs. I decided to switch to BT but the online service would only offer me slow internet. I was called by a customer representative who asked to perform a credit check before anything else. I know that my credit is fine, but following the check all they could offer me was the slow service - apparently the 76mbs is not available in my area - even though this is what talktalk provide! The CSR told me they may be able to upgrade me once i had switched. So my credit has been pinged for no apparent reason. BT just seem so backwards."
Jo ROGERSON,WA13 9TE,4/15/18,Paid for Fibre broadband and still slow and patchy - very frustrating service
Loren,Surrey,4/13/18,"Without a doubt the worst service I have ever been provided. Internet speed is so slow I actually leave the house if I need to do work, consistently drops. When trying to contact them you get put through to people reading a script having no clue what to do and nothing gets resolved. Appalling utterly appalling...leaving them and going back to Virgin."
Ollie,Hertfordshire,4/11/18,"Absolutely shocking, bad customer service and make it so you don’t get your package on the right day and to top it all off they make it so your internet is terrible in the day and say you bought 8mbps your would get about 500kbps DO NOT BUY"
Em,Nottingham,4/10/18,"Shocking service. Customer service is only helpful for textbook problems. Still awaiting my gift card, which is what enticed me as oppose to going to another provider! Will be cancelling the whole families packages as they end their contacts. Clearly don’t value there customers at all. Moved my partner to virgin and was sent the equipment and I set it up within 3 days of ordering! And best bit is it is half the price for twice the speed!!!"
Marek,Prestonpans,4/10/18,"I do not understand, how people can give such negative opinions about BT. After a several years horror with TalkTalk, switched to BT, and what? Everything works fine and smooth. Expected arround 26-30 Mbs down, got 51 constant speed as promised for BT Infinity 52! It is now 20 days from switch date. So, I adviced my son in law to switch as well! He did it and what??? ...happy, speed as promised 51 on every test. Before switch I've got 10 to 16 from promised 76 Mbs. Disconnections twice a day, nightmare!!!TalkTalk always said and had an excuse, that this must have been a line problem, or router fault. Liars!!! This was a total waste of money and time with previous broadband provider, just excuses and apologies, never got a concrete advise! Call centre - rubbish, you are talking with Delhi. Chat rubbish, always problem to connect! At BT, you can do most things via www. They inform you via email, about every single issue. I do not gloryfy BT, but it is much better option, than TalkTalk and to be honest, other broadband providers, as I had to do with some of them earlier."
Chris,Swansea,4/10/18,"Without a doubt the worst service I've ever had. Constant drop outs, and speed below 1mb/s. I've been complaining for over a year about the connection quality and still nothing has been done. Call center staff give you a different excuse depending on the day, engineers have not turned up to 5 appointments. I wouldn't use BT services if they were free."
Kimberley,Cotswolds,4/8/18,"WHAT AN APPALLING COMPANY!!

Their service is atrocious. When they started BT Sport they promised it would be free for customers so we signed up only for them to start charging us. when you call up to chat to them you get a rude someone who talks down to you and refuses to even listen to you just reading from a script.

The broadband cut out ALL the time

Third party engineers they sent out to fix problems would tell us how Mickey Mouse the wiring is and how we get any broadband service is a miracle

AND yet they feel they have the right to shout at us - the customer, surely the ones that keep them in business???

Please can we do something about these awful companies that take all our money for the worst service ever!!!

I will not use BT which means I cannot have BT sport. Thank god Channel 5 have stepped to cover the MotoGP"
Alex,Dartford,4/8/18,"5 Routers Later Connection Still Drops

After contacting BT 6 times and 5 Hub5's later enough is enough. The router resets itself many times a day and all BT do is send another router. Clearly it's not the router and after some investigation it appears the BT network is overloaded. According to a professional BT wire everybody onto the same ring and that can not handle the bandwidth of everybody at peak times.

I contacted them a few weeks ago and they said they would monitor the connection. 8 router resets later over 4 days they claimed it had not dropped in the 4 days they was monitoring. Clearly they can't admit to the real issue.

They also told us that in their T&C's it states that the connection can drop up to 5 times a day so tough luck. I signed up for 2 year contract a year ago and I'm regretting it massively.

Any gamers or people that need a solid connection for personal use I cant warn you enough. DON'T GET BT."
Anne Hopkins,Swinton,4/7/18,Rang bt to request name change was informed or cas kr be changed due to having a credit check in that name. I can change my name with passport office mortgage and bank among many other credit accounts I hold. BT need to be more sympathetic and understanding and respect and individuals wish. Imagine shocking circumstances had occurred to that person and they cannot bear to see that name shame on your outdated and harsh service
SF,Runcorn,4/6/18,

rawstron,bude cornwall,4/4/18,"Bt broadband from BT does not do what it says it will i was offered up to 32mg speed and yet i have never got over 25mg
almost every weekend i get up to 8mg yet i still pay the price for up to 32mg i then get emails asking me to take the higher broadband higher price and supposedly higher speeds yet BT's own engineers state i could never get over 32mg with the line i have now but still they push me into getting the higher broadband just so i have to pay more for the same as i get now something should be done about Bt and there practises"
Charlie,leicester,4/2/18,
Jo,Cheshire,4/2/18,"Signing up to the contract in the first place was easy, at the time only ADSL was abailable, at 20 MBps. I knew I couldn't get better than this at the time, but BT still tried to push a speedier and more expensive package on me. This package worked fine, but once the contract expired, and, I suspect as fibre became available, I recorded speeds of as low as 2 MBps. As we were out of contract, I'm now paying £47 per month for this. Tried to upgrade to fibre through BT, only to find that fibre is available for £29 per month to new customers but £53 per month to me!!!!
At the time of the contract, they of course sent me a home hub, I hate these, they portion off a chunk of your signal to broadcast as a BT Openzone, and aren't very good. I have my own wifi box and broadcast easily across the house.
If I test my broadband speed on BT, they don't tell you what the speed is, just that its 'OK'. Funny that, when I know it is a very low speed.Then if you follow the prompts, they reccomend moving your box to the middle of the house. Guess what BT, it IS in the middle of the house.
So I have switched to Vodaphone fibre for considerably less money. Not switched on yet, but feels as though BT have been robbing me blind to be honest!!!!"
Ben,Coleraine,4/2/18,"Bt have the worst customer service I have ever seen or heard have, the WiFi is so poor we have to use our mobile data"
Jar Bancroft,Keighley,4/2/18,"I'm looking at all these reviews and can't believe it...you would think no one is happy with BT!...well I am! I know they are not the cheapest, and you can always see a cheaper deal somewhere, but sometimes the devil you know is the best options. Other than a lower speed [30mg]than expected, I am more than happy with my broadband/phone service. If the day ever comes when I am not, I will look around but not use the reviews on this site for reference as they are not a reflection of the true situation with any provider."
Jo hyde,Bucks,4/1/18,
Max,,3/30/18,
Lorraine,Leyland,3/28/18,Months of problems with low speed. Get different advise each time I ring. Did stumble across a BT forum and the teckie guys were helpful but service has dipped again. Frustrating
Dave,Cambridgeshire,3/28/18,"Tried to order broadband & phone on 2nd March with delivery/engineers vist booked for 19th. Broadband cancelled by BT with no explanation. Re-ordered with phone & BB to be installed 23rd March. BB cancelled again. Reordered for 3rd April. Exixting phone & BB disconnected on 23rd March. BB still scheduled for 3rd April, no phone until 5th April.
Totally cheesed off - no info about what, or why it's all gone wrong. Staff seem to be trying to sort it out but BT/Openreach couldn't organise one in a brewery."
James,London,3/27/18,"Horrible service, taking ages to install broadband. Failed installation, cancelled order three times, previous broadband disconnected now without broadband at all. Always try to blame others. Keep on promising someone gonna call you back but nothing. What a waste of time will be cancelling my order ang going back to Sky!"
Jayne,Glasgow,3/26/18,"4th complaint in 3 months

Steph,Worcester,3/25/18,"Never had any problems with our BT broadband. Reliable, very quick and unlimited downloads. Cost was a bit higher than elsewhere but worth it in my opinion."
Tom,York,3/25/18,Absolutely terrible customer service. Was overcharged on a bill and was promised a refund - this wasn't processed so rang again and was told this would be reflected in following bill - it wasn't and in the end I had to chase up 3 times. Now waiting to see if refund comes through. Won't be staying when contract ends.
Reluctant customer,Leicester,3/25/18,"I switched my internet provider from Sky to BT two months ago and I have nothing but problems with the reliability of the connection and the service I receive. The internet connection drops out and I get very low speeds to the point where I cannot open a web page! In the 6 years with Sky I never had any problems with connection or any cause to call customer services.
Every time I contact BT they test the line and find no fault, they say the line is not dropping and fob me off with the same old things to try, on the last call I was told BT they will only guarantee a wired connection and told me to hard wire all of my devices or to look to change my provider. When I asked to leave my contract due to the issues I was told I would be charged. I am now trapped in a contract that does not deliver the service I need consistently.
BT customer service is very poor and they do not care about their customers and are only interested in fleecing them for the money. I do not write review normally but I felt compelled to write at my disgust at the way this company treats its customers.
Do not use BT for internet, if you have problems you will be on your own"
NOT HAPPY CUSTOMER,,3/24/18,Most expensive internet provider in the country with 42.99 for brodband and line rental and stupidly expensive call charges.
Ahmed,Romford,3/24/18,"I am BT customer for a number of years. My problem with the service is:
1-The service not reliable and can stop working for no reason. You spend time (hours) with BT support and the service come back and the question when will stop next time. It will not disappoint you until you see the Hub flashing.
2-Calling BT is old from the book customer (NO) care. Your call is important to us kind of. We are very busy and your call is important to us. The same story every time.
3-As a closed my bank account where the Direct Debit goes from the service get restricted and when I realised that (and it is my fault), I immediately paid by card and set up direct debit. I have been told the service will be back within four hours. But guess what. seven hours and the service not back. Then typical BT the time frame changed to 24 hours.
At the end I started looking around and I am moving away from BT. No need for the hassle of unreliable service where you can have a much reliable service from another provider and for less money."
Richard Smith,Burstow,3/24/18,
Richard Ball,Rossendale,3/24/18,"They are just about making money and increasing charges. They continually increase the cost and tell you they can’t reduce it, yet they offer new customers cheap deals. They make it difficult to exit their contract and if you change anything your 18 month contract automatically renews. This industry needs regulating it is disgraceful how they operate. These are meant to be industry leaders."
Matthew Rance,Wootton Bassett,3/23/18,I have just had to cancel a new package with another provider because BT made it too uncomfortable for me to cancel my existing one which has been giving me ongoing problems. Basically the people i spoke to found it neccesary to CROSS EXAMINE me about why i am cancelling and asked questions about my new package with no regard to how this made me feel resulting in me having an ANXIETY ATTACK. For now i am stuck with BT as my broadband provider until i at least have taken advice on how to deal with this upset in a stress free way
Adrian,Looe,3/23/18,"Shocking service, took five weeks to install broadband. Failed installation 4 times, cancelled same day twice, always try to blame others. Management unempowered to resolve customer issues of their making. Regret using."
John,Hailsham East Sussex,3/22/18,"A total waste of time,complete rip off. Far to expensive ,soon as connected price goes up. Have changed to talktalk all good half the price with free 24/7 phone calls. B t cant even get my address correct I stopped final dd payment been sending final bill to the wrong address insisting I used to live there, want to charge me £7.50 laye payment fee for their mistake. Been getting phone calls from aragant women who insist bill must be paid now, give us card no, no way baby. B t is one of if not the worst company I have ever dealt with. May they go bust soon.Do not deal with them."
R. Busch,London,3/21/18,"BT provides the worst service I ever received in this world. They left me with nearly no broadband for 3 month sending me engineers that decided that there was an internal fault in my wiring. Everybody knows that they are responsible to deliver a signal to the first junction box in the house and everybody knows that with all other wiring disconnected it should work. Not with BT after numerous calls, chats, letters, they only found that they want to charge me for their engineers visits. I closed direct debit for them after three months with no internet but horrifying bills. I went to another provider and from the next day onwards I had a superb signal and no worries except BT chasing me now to pay their unjustified bills.
I don’t trust them nor their works they just try to justified their engineers visits with lies for stupid people that don’t understand electrical problems. Their disadvantage is that I used to be an electrician and do understand all their lies."
Victoria Martin,Peeblesshire,3/21/18,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would.
The treatment of my family has been absolutely diabolical. They have admitted time and time again that they missold policies to my elderly parents and yet months on, despite my efforts nothing has been resolved. My family live in a remote area and without landline communications, they are completely without any form of phone or internet. This is very distressing for elderly people as well as constant harassment from different departments of BT demanding bill payment, despite the complete admittance of fault from BT. As a medical professional, if this was a small company, this would be considered a safeguarding issue, exploiting elderly people. I am absolutely appalled. If only my family lived in an area where they could get Virgin service. If you can be with an alternative company to provide your communications then I urge you to do so. This is a large corporation taking advantage of the public. I would like to know how many other people have been missold tariffs and are in a similar situation."
pat,greenock,3/19/18,"Was with Virgin left for BT, BIG mistake, wrong TV box sent, got that sorted, then the major problems started, tv and broadband constantly dropping when phone rings, all efforts to fix blamed on my side so I will need to pay for an engineer. Read reviews of other peoples problem with BT and found that my problem was common. Phoned BT and on chat lines so many times."
Bob,West Sussex,3/19/18,"DO NOT USE BT!!! - If you even consider using their service, DON'T!!!! Please - if you are looking at broadband and are reading this, take it from my first hand personal experience that these criminals want your money and nothing more!! I had signed a contract with BT and it took them 3 months.... 3 MONTHS to actually get the internet to work, this involved calls nearly everyday of which the representative on each occasion had no idea that I had called the day before and made me go through the same steps every time to check my broadband was working then said ""call tomorrow and see if it repairs the issue"". They made me do this for weeks! Then said they had sent out hardware which they hadn't as each time I called, the representative then told me that nothing had been sent and they themselves would send out the hardware... that took 3 attempts. Had I have wasted as much of their time as they had of mine I am sure they would charge me for that too!!

THEN - when I complained they offered me a £10 compensation... £10.... 10 measly pounds after which by this point the contract had cost me nearly £150... for no internet!! That is like robbing a guy and not going to court for it!! Then when I ask to leave they want me to pay the full contract. which is 2 years long! Needless to say, they can't get their act together, they are absolute CRIMINALS!!!!

I sincerely hope that NOBODY even thinks of using this service, it is slow, expensive and the hardware they provide you with would be better off being used as a frisbee. ABSOLUTE UTTER RUBBISH!!!"

Kevin Parker,Herefordshire,3/16/18,"Disgraceful service. Order placed in early dec and no connection in mid March . I have formally complained and been put into ""intensive Care"". This involves an off shore person calling me with incoherent updates every week using technical jargon that they are reading off of a screen, and nothing now happens automatically and requires human intervention which doesn't happen. So, step 2 gets completed and step 3 doesn't get initiated until I get on the phone and chase. I have wasted 8 days off of work, and am drained. Dreadful, dreadful service especially the offshore ""intensive care "" team. I am cancelling my order without getting connected, after around 30 phone calls and 8 days off of work I am drained by it. The regulator should revoke their licence."
david bray,Stoke on Trent,3/15/18,Do not sign up to BT they will take your money and not give you what you are paying for. forget customer services they are a waste of space. they will give you features you dont want and charge more and be unable to do anything about it. Sky are a million miles better and will move back as soon as possible. was grossly misold the product and am very very unhappy. will never use or trust BT again.
Craig,Weston-super-Mare,3/15/18,"AWFUL , signed up to a broadband deal which was advertised to include 18 months free bt sport , they then didn't honor it and blamed me for not ordering it right when i followed the link and it was plastered all over the screen stating i would get it. they then said they would give me ten pounds goodwill which was not good enough as i moved from sky which was cheaper to get this bt sport deal. awful customer service."
Aya,Newport,3/15/18,I'm very very disappointed since I've joined bt I'm spending £31 on only broadband yet I've been over charged a few times which was bt fault and claims its a mistake!and due to that I ended up getting debts from the bank each time. Costumer services always give you different information .I also have waisted allot of monthly minutes on just contacting bt. You are losing a jenuinly lovely costumer who quiet frankly had enough and will be thinking of cancelling contract.
M B,London,3/14/18,"BT Infinity is a waste of time, energy and money. They are incapable of delivering on their own contract terms. Dismissive, rude and obnoxious customer service when trying to complain and escalate unresolved issues. Stay well away if you actually want any kind of decent service."
M Simmonds,Midsomer Norton,3/14/18,"As my current BT broadband/calls package is costing £37.99pm, I checked on BT website to find that ""new customers"" can get the package for £24.99. So I used the online chat - after a very long wait for an adviser - to ask if I could get a cheaper deal (or quit BT!). Eventually was rung and passed over to a sales adviser to whom I complained I felt I was paying too much and what better deal could he offer. He first offered a contract which was only £6 cheaper, then when I prevaricated he offered a 2 yr contract at £29pm - but only if I placed the order there and then (altho I would have 14 days to cancel on receipt of their confirming email). It was stated that if I didn't take the deal today, there was no guarantee it would be available on a subsequent enquiry!! Needless to say, I told him I was going to explore a different provider, and I hung up!! Bully boy tactics I will not abide."
John wilson,Liverpool,3/12/18,"Oh...dear...a month ago my internet went offline. Engineer came out then it took a week to fix. A month later its down again. Call for engineer first meeting missed, arrange another, that was also missed too! Called to find out whats going on only to find put problem with exchange and ports...not acceptable. Its still down now and has been now for 2 weeks out of a month and keep blaming the ports and the exchange like they think we wont know wjat they mean when im involved in IT. They dont know what the problem is and the service is poor. I will not recommend bt to anyone. Avoid."
Alex David,Edinburgh,3/12/18,"As existing BT customer just attempted to upgrade from copper to fibre (Infinity) Broadband. As usual with BT this has worked OK technically, but horrendously / comically badly in terms of dealing with BT admin.
Started with an appalling website, very difficult (for a very frequent online user) to determine current package and costs; rip-off prices for loyal customers (new customer deals for £25/ month are £50/month for existing!); after two phone calls agreed a better price, but order confirmation entirely wrong (standard prices); two phone calls, one formal complaint and a month and not sorted out the pricing. BT = B??? Terrible!"
David,North Somerset,3/12/18,Broadband speed is quite variable and the wifi signal often drops out.
Paul mckenzie,Wirral,3/11/18,
Marika,Milton Keynes,3/11/18,Moved the house 5 weeks ago and still got no service.Been pushed from pillar to the post.Very poor customer services spent hours on the phone.Been promised connection few times and there we are 5 weeks later still no internet no tv and no telephone.No goodwill gesture NOTHING.Thats how you get treated after being loyal customer for over 5 years.Another phone call today stating that the service that ment to be starting in 2 weeks was cancelled again.And all they had to say is sorry.Very poor customer service
FADY SOBHY,UXBRIDGE,3/10/18,"very bad at everything, never tell you the truth. nobody helps with your problem. THEY ALWAYS OVER CHARE, SO IF YOU CHECK YOUR BILL THEY WILL KEEP ON OVER CHARGING. WE WILL NEVER RECOMMEND."
Leigh Montgomery,DUNOON,3/10/18,"I foned on the 8th March , afternoon, I had a BT guy at my door by 845 the next morning in Dunoon. The man was very friendly and explained things very well and resolved my problem and I felt that he did his job very well. All I know is he has jinger hair and works in dunoon. Great asset to your company."
Steph,Old Colwyn,3/9/18,"I was recommended BT after ringing a company that would stop my contract with Virgin Media and set up a new contract with BT in my new area (VM doesn’t provide its services in Old Colwyn otherwise I’d have stayed with them) and I have never been so disappointment in my 5 years of living alone. I got told that my tv box and internet hub would be delivered on the 08/01/2018 which it was. And the engineer would be coming out on the morning of 09/01/2018 to install and set everything up for us. On the 09/01/2018 everything was also meant to go live(which it didn’t!!). No engineer turned up but when I opened the boxes, I found instructions that I was to set it all up myself. So I did and nothing. Rang BT to be spoken to like dirt and laughed at because I wasn’t sure if I had done it right. The woman hung up on me so my husband called back the next day as nothin was working still. The kind gentleman apologised and told us that he couldn’t get an engineer out until the following week. Following Tuesday, a young man came out and set it all up for me and left without seeing if it was working(which it was not) so another phone call to BT and they wanted me to wait a further two weeks for another engineer. I told them that was fine but I wasn’t paying for my services for the time I didn’t have them. The guy started shouting at me down the phone and hung up on me, AGAIN!! Two weeks & several phone calls later, someone came out to my house and told me that the box didn’t work and he get them to send out another. 10 days later that turned up and I still wasn’t receiving the services. By this time I’d lost count of how many hours myself and my husband had spent on the phone to BT and they agreed to take money off my bill. SIX POUND was all they could take off my bill when 5/6 weeks into having the contract I had no services. I fought until I was blue in the face and eventually they let the bill go. I told them I wanted to leave BT & they told me it was £700 to cancel with them bc I was past the time line. BY ONE DAY!! They are bullies and their customer service is disgusting. Eventually they agreed I could come out of the contract after I threatened to take them to trading standards!! AVOID JOINING BT AT ALL COSTS. I’ve had to keep my internet contract with BT and I don’t haven’t had a problem since I was guided over the phone how to fix this. But I still wouldn’t recommend."
Andrew Nelson,Chester Le Street,3/9/18,Absolutely the worst customer services I have ever encountered! Three appointments now moved to have install and one was given to someone else when my wife waited in from 8am until 6pm for a 8am to 1pm appointment. New date confirmed and then a call to reschedule further down the line again. No one interested in sorting after explaining the issue to three different people in different departments! Dread to think what it would be like when you eventually receive the services!
Michaela sweet,Brightwell-cum-sotwell,3/9/18,What a great person to have working for your company! Darren Williamson was so Polite and very helpful. After 6 months of waiting to be connected back he came and said that some has took our phone line- why the last couple of people couldn’t work that out I don’t know. Thanks Darren your the best.
s ahmed,Bradford,3/8/18,
Michael Heaton,Warminster,3/8/18,"Our BT broadband is so slow as to be useless for anything other than email. I have reported the fault again, but they insist there is nothing wrong with our 0.5mB download speed."
Tracey,Sunderland,3/8/18,"I've never received worst customer service in my life than with this company. Went onto the live chat as I was charged quite considerably more than what I should've been for my bill. So after just under an hour of speaking to 'aditya' male or female who knows? She said let me speak to my supervisor... a few minutes after receiving that message, he/she left the chat. Leaving my problem unsolved and I didn't receive a phone call or email or anything in response. He/she was quite happy to just leave it at that. Undoubtedly the WORST 'customer service' I've ever received. The broadband speed is good ill give them that but apart from that I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone unless you want to be ripped off monthly and be treat appallingly. Disgraceful."
GoodByeBT,,3/8/18,
Alex Bleicker,London,3/8/18,"Awful customer service, I've been trying to resolve an issue for the last 8 months since I moved into a new property but it has been my worst nightmare!

Stay away, this company doesn't give a damn about you as a customer, they will just milk you!"
AshleyH,Isle of Wight,3/7/18,"Is this the worst most heinous bullying company in the UK?
Hike their prices up whenever they feel like it and when you exercise your right to leave they try to bully and threaten you with all sorts. This is the second time (yes, how stupid am I) I have been with BT and I left them early last time because they upped their prices mid term. Chasing a fe £ that time cost lost them £100s, now the same thing has happened again.
To be fair to BT I know people who simply pay the increase and are happy paying through the nose so I guess overall the awful business model of ripping people off does work for them.
However BT will never ever get my direct custom again."
HELEN,BRISTOL,3/6/18,"Avoid at all cost. Worst company ever. Didn't keep appointment and no-one contacted me to explain why. Customer service is abysmal. Have made a complaint but they still don't keep me up to date. Nobody tells you anything, just a load of lies and fobbed off.I hve no idea what the problem is and why it is taking so long to have my broadband conected. Will be looking for a new provider and cancelling my order."
Shaun,London,3/5/18,"Worked fine until 2 months ago. Now it drops connection randomly. Bt help desk are worse than useless and are unable to answer why or even fix it. Speed is decent IF you can keep a reliable connection. An ISP I would not recommend anyone take up. Also as a point of note, had my net go down for 5 days with no support from BT. Not the service I expected and definitely a service I am leaving"
Daniel,Bristol,3/5/18,I have been waiting for BT to connect our broadband for 4 weeks. They have had to cancel the original order and create a new one today meaning we will be without internet for another 3 weeks. They claim we can use their BT wifi network but their own website shows it is not available on our road. Terrible service. Offered no help. We paid £59 set up fee which was more than other providers. Would not recommend
William,Ayr,3/4/18,"Worse then dreadful
Some 40 years of good BT digital service gone in a puff of supposedly high speed broadband . But haven’t a clue on performance and service . My broadband has not worked properly since I took it up 4 months ago . They tell me it’s my iMac that’s faulty so I arrange to take in to Apple Then I think it’s my iPad that’s gone wrong so I buy new iPad . There nothing wrong with Apple it’s bt How I would like to cancel my contract ."
Just jon,Suffolk,3/3/18,"Completely and utterly useless.
They don't turn up, they give no reason and won't even call back to offer a new appointment.
But they're happy to add services to you bill that you haven't asked for.
Avoid at all costs."

Aleksandra,North Wales,2/28/18,"Hi everyone !
Me and my fiance are with Bt since Jun 2013. We lived in LLandudno for 3,5 years and we had network disconations and speed internet problems. My fiance alredy spend on phone over 50 hours talking to Bt staff.
Now we live in Colwyn Bay and you can gues it is the same crap and again useless phone talks with BT staff.
I do not know if i have to laugh or cry, becouse for 75MB we are paing over 50 pounds and we can not change our bordband becouse of our contract !
It is my nightmare becouse i loooovee playing mmorpg and i need strong conetion. I really want to cry.
I am absolutly unhappy with BT it is an expansive nightmare.

Aleksandra"
Kieran,York,2/28/18,Got told our bt box was getting delivered never came the day after an engineer was ment to be coming out never came didn't even get a phone call to let us know rang up again and said they would call us the following day but didn't so we rang them to find that apparently the order has failed twice but every time we rang they kept telling something different!! Absolute joke!!
Henry,London,2/28/18,"BT is overpriced and Customer Service is rather arrogant.

They do brag constantly how well they are whereas they cant even keep up the internet speed as promised despite of many repairs and support.

I understand this may not be the case for many but still the arrogance is a real put off by the Customer Service in general."
Chris,Derby,2/28/18,"54mbps on a guaranteed 100mbps minimum line. I was told 80 down and 20 up were my minimums, I get 54 down and 8 up."
Luke,England,2/27/18,I’m moving house soon and these fools can’t even keep my internet working. “Their system has shut them out” but of useless morons at part from one chap I spoke to who was nice and helpful. I would go to any other internet provider instead.
Thomas,Scotland,2/26/18,"Constantly crashes and isn't even close to the speed you pay for with the worst customer service imaginable. Steer clear, they are useless."
Jonathan,Nantwich,2/24/18,"Trying to upgrade to Ultrafast - got an email saying it's available, try to buy and website says it's not. Speak to customer services, apparently their 'old system' knows its available,. hence the email, but the 'new system' doesn't, so they can't sell it to me. So they say they will fix that and place the order for me, even give me an order number. Long and tedious story cut short, that order had never been placed, raised complaints, spoke to every man and his dog in India multiple times, still not fixed. Utter shambles."
Georgia,,2/23/18,"We moved house 2 weeks ago, was meant to have an engineer come out Monday and no one showed. Partner rang and was told we would get a call Tuesday, still nothing. I rang on Wednesday and after speaking to numerous people I was put through to Josh. He sorted us out, used his common sense and a new broadband box was sent out the next day, which I set up. (An engineer was never needed.) brilliant customer service from Josh."
Paul,Longdown,2/21/18,"We’re towards the end of a line in a semi rural location with very old wiring. Speed and reliability is poor, service is poor and cost is high as we pay for high speed in order to get best speed at box before it starts to deteriorate over the distance. BT have no interest in improving the situation and other providers do want to take it on or “network is not released to them”"
Fed up,Oldham,2/21/18,"Shocking service, claim to be unable to get openreach to return and install service correctly as broadband and phone work. However fail to grasp that open reach have run cables all over neighbours property. Installed on the 15/02/18 I cancelled morning of the 16/02 as BT kept saying there was nothing they could do. I’ve now had to go to another provider and hope all goes well but have lost my phone number which I’ve Had for over 20yrs, have no broadband for over a month as I can’t have time off work for another month to be there for another installation and have one very unhappy neighbour to boot. All I kept getting was sorry, sorry doesn’t put this right. A simple call to openreach from BT was all that was required but no it’s all too much trouble."

Richard,High Wycombe,2/20/18,"When it works everything id good , when it does not you are in a sue for a call centre in India. SHOCKINGLY poor customer service. Very nice & friendly but totally ineffective. To solve issues with Mac network connecting to BT home hub I ended up calling apple (sorted) - BT hopeless"
S Y,London,2/20/18,"Honestly. It's been a year of absolute hell with BT. Guys; do not bother. Most people I know are now with sky and I have heard nothing but praise. (And yes before people think this is one bad experience, I have been in contact with BT on a weekly basis for months now... Have replaced equipment and wiring... And guess what- I'm still paying the bill. Cannot wait to terminate)"
Michael,Hertfordshire,2/20/18,"Have been with BT for about 12 years using their broadband and fibre services, packaged with a landline. The service has been very reliable and easy to set up. The one time we had problems, the router was replaced (for free) and immediately resolved the issue.

However, despite the service offering up to 40Mb, we're lucky to get 20 - good enough for what we need, but not as good as advertised, and not likely to be good enough moving forward with the increasing demand for bandwidth.

The price has also risen significantly recently - nearly a 30% rise over the last year. As a result, we're looking for a lower cost deal, either with BT or someone else. That's not reflective of their value over the length of our time with them, but of their current price and what we get for it."
Mohamed,Enniskillen,2/19/18,I had been with bt over 3 year and I actually was puying more then a any new customer you will get notting for been loyal with bt and connection actually very very poor 6 mbps for 30.99 thats a a joke I won't recommend bt to anyone walk away if u cann better then stay
glynn evans,cambridge,2/19/18,Your time is valueless to BT. Be prepared for connection failure followed by waiting in for a 5 hour window with no pre-call when en route. On arrival the engineer will tell you the problem is their end as it always is (there's nothing in your home that can go wrong). Mendacious incompetents uncontrolled by effective competition and consumer advocacy. They make masses giving rotten service so why make any effort?
alan,uk,2/19/18,"Can not wait until contract is over. always losing connection, its the worst internet we have ever had. the router is rubbish."
Bianca,Manchester,2/18/18,"£50/ month - Slow connection, connection dropped everyday. And yes I did report the fault. I have been woth the company for 2 years now and nothing changes. It’s almost everyday now that I am struggling with this. Still this is not a good internet company provider"
GnomeNose,Harrow,2/18/18,"Returned to BT for phone services after trouble with Talktalk and for broadband when free serve died. All was fine for a year or so, then got charged for BT sport which I expressly states I didn’t want, I managed to get a 50% refund and will never trust BT again (this was common practice and BR were fined by Ofcom for malpractice). Since then I have had numerous faults with noisy, crackly and intermittent phone line and unstable broadband. Despite hours on the phone, 6 engineer visits( one of which didn’t arrive), and a massive collection of data about broadband and phone stats, 8 months on I am no better off. It took 6 months for my fault to be escalated so I didn’t have to repeat myself each time I called the Help desk, the fault is now managed personally by a very helpful manager but she is hamstrung by the disastrous BT fault management procedure. I am now out of contract and paying a fortune for a disastrous service, but don’t feel I can leave whilst there is a fault as who ever I move to will still use theBT Openreach lines and I’ll have to start all over again.
In summary, untrustworthy with sharp practices, incompetent, unreliable and poor value for money. Avoid like the plague."
David Morris,E7,2/18/18,"Totally, totally useless. We ordered our service 3 weeks and a month later nothing, Crap provider. I would NOT recommend BT to my worst enemy. Shocking, atrocious service. Please do go somewhere else."
Jim lewis,Edinburgh,2/17/18,Total disgrace again by BT. Dealing with them since October. Indian call centre. Nobody know what they are doing. You have now lost our shop account as well. Should not be allowed to trade. All blame each other all the time.

Holywood Citizen,Craigantlet,2/13/18,"Worst ever service and broadband you can get. BT likes to do nothing but are very happy to send you stupid invoices for a service they do not provide!

Avoid at all time. Not reliable, Unfriendly and arrogant! Avoid this company! An absolute disgrace!"
DP,WR6,2/13/18,"Had an email from BT to say that local exchange had been upgraded for more stability and possibly more speed. TWO WEEKS LATER my speed is still a quarter of what it previously was - and that was stupidly low - despite calls to and from ""managers"" (piss-up/brewery style) in UK and in India AND two Openreach engineer visits. All personnel charming and helpful but the dots aren't joined-up, right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. Result - frustration, loss of work, wasted hours.
IF ONLY there were an alternative in this rural area - but all rivals use BT's copper lines and we're too far away for the village's fibre.
What irks me most is the fact that we've had FIVE Mbps here in the past and now we're down to 0.6 despite NO new subscribers in our area."
Dougie,Dougie.,2/13/18,"I have claimed that broadband speed I very slow.
They keep agreeing it's slow and they are working on it, this has been going on for over four weeks , it's still the same."
ALAN,TURVEY,2/11/18,"BT Infinty is really good - the kit is really well packaged, simple to set up and performance is good and stable.
Fundamentally good product makes up for the wacky world of BT customer service - perseverence is the key - keep going till you find someone sensible to talk to and ignore the muppets (eg the nice man who advised we had a problem with the underground pole). So far all has eventually come good in the end."
Damon Evans,Canterbury,2/11/18,"Not happy with this company, lost my Samsung galaxy 8 with my BT mobile sim contract inside as i used this sim with my handset witch did come from another network but used BT, when i lost my handset my insurance asked for proof of usage witch BT could not give me they had poor excuses to why they couldnt give this info witch i believe they should be as sim was used with that handset in question, i was told till blue in the face they could not provide proof of usage strangely, witch has now caused me big issues with getting my handset replaced by insurance no proof of usage no claim. so now im at a big loss of a £750 handset i cant replace and stuck in a 2 year contract paying £44 a month with no handset, no thanks to BT mobile not providing the appropriate info for my insurance company, when i mentioned court action bt all of a sudden managed to produce documents out of the blue witch did not even gel with my claim, so i believe this is made up and it come across very suspicious i am now forced with having to take court action at a cost to me, as a autism suffer and suffer of Asperger's i found my ordeal very very frustrating and distressing i have been without a handset since Oct now while dealing with this and every day my mental health gets effected and now forced to buy out for a new handset. i believe BT mobile to be liable in this case and having to take them and others to court over this now, id stay well clear of BT for mobile phones they have a poor reaction to customers issues and cant even do the simplest of things and unless you want to lose out i wouldnt even go there. not worth the stresses or action that has to be taken after dealing with them i also managed to gather over £50 worth of phone call charges to my home phone in relations to all contact to companies about issues revolving this. very upset customer and will never use BT again or advise people to go with them. I also had to go through the Ombudsman who sided with my insurance company and denied my claim due to no proof of usage so i feel BT are at fault and liable and act very suspiciously, i had to go through reconsideration with insurance and the ombudsman companies all to a fail due to one simple bit of info BT wont and say cant provide. Soon as a sim is put in to a handset that network is aware and details are logged of this imei number and with that number states what phone is used so why they cant do what other networks do is beyond me."
Chris Hume,Aberdeen,2/10/18,You sign up to an expensive 24 month contract with the first year prepaid. They hike the price after 12 months tell you you received an email 10 months in informing you of the price hike and giving you the option to leave. You show you didn't receive the email and they say this is an issue for you and your email service provider. It will cost you £300 to leave the new price hiked contact that you are locked into. BT is as scam and once I get out I will never use the again. Furious :(
Gerry Joseph,PE32 1JJ,2/10/18,"My Broadband speed is pathetic, so I went on line (again) to see if BT fibreoptic Infinity, was available as several months ago, cable was laid. The checker said ""Yes its available"" I went through the ""deal"" page ordered the fastest package, then with it in my basket it said ""Not available in your area"". Dear BT, as is said by teachers ""You have plenty of room for improvement"""
Rom,Uttoxeter,2/9/18,"I put one star because I couldn't choose none. Absolute rubbish. Don't do what they say, don't deliver. In a new build, still no land line since September (5 months now) and no Internet since December (2 months) and we are still paying... A few engineers came to fix the broadband and connected us to the network of our neighbours to finally remove the connection as not set-up correctly. Still awaiting for some update, they cannot be bothered to tell us what is going on. Simply the worst customer service I have ever seen. I couldn't care less that they understand how frustrated it may be to spend hours on the phone to simply get an update. Stay away!!!!!!"
Dylan,,2/7/18,"My WiFi with Bt use to be the best in my town until some baboon who worked for Bt tried to put my neighbours enternet in and broke our and only came back the next day to fix it.

I was quite annoyed with this because when they did fix it my WiFi is really slow and they do not want to come out and look at it or give us a solution."
Helen,Newquay,2/6/18,"Absolute crap, can not wait to get out of this contract , which they keep changing their minds when that is. got a package for £36 a month but often get billed £85 for using the phone a hand full of times. Too expensive in this day and age, will be using my mobile from now on instead of landline."
Londoner,London,2/6/18,"Signed to Bt internet and within a couple of weeks of joining the internet connection became unreliable, often cutting out, slowing down and now we have been without wifi for over 2 weeks. We have made 3 appointments and every engineer visit has been a no show. Completely unacceptable customer service team, who are unable to provide appointment commitments they can keep, to remain calm or to give reasons for the engineers not showing up. DO NOT JOIN BT!"
Neil Griffin,"Northwick, Bristol",2/5/18,"I had standard BT broadband with a speed of 2mbps, I contacted BT who said if I up grade to infinity I would get a minimum speed of 17 Mbps. I upgraded and only received a speed of 10 Mbps approx. I contacted BT several times and had line checks done and a visit from a engineer who said due to my location I was lucky to get a speed of 10 Mbps. On contacted BT again several times they would still not admit miss selling me the contract. I then contacted the ombudsman who found BT at fault for miss selling, said I could leave the contract with out penalty, have £40 debited to my account and 1 month broad band free of charge. BT now want to charge me £317.20 for leaving my contract early even though I have sorted another BT contract for infinity and the ombudsman has instructed them that I could leave without penalty. They are a complete joke, the service is a joke, there departments don't speak to each other, some of the staff(not all) are rude and ignorant, I really can't think of one reason why I would recommend BT."

Steve,Stanton St Quintin,2/4/18,"Being able to see a Superfast Broadband green box from my window, yet only being able to receive 0.3Mb/sec is hugely frustrating. Our BT Broadband service is intermittent at best, dropping out at least 20-30 times each day! We have complained to BT so many times, several OpenReach and contractors have visited, assessed and concluded there is a fault between us and the exchange 4 miles away but in their opinion it'll never get addressed as the main road to Malmesbury from M4/J17 will require major disruption to repair/replace the damaged areas - which apparently there are lots of!"
Neil,Stockport,2/3/18,"After signing up to broadband in the January deals which came with an awards card, they saying they could take over an exsisting phone line which was great, I would have broadband in two weeks, a week later they cancelled the order and said they couldn’t as the phone line was linked to another provider which was strange as the previous owner took their provider with them two weeks prior, I rang up and was promised fast tracking to hopefully get the broadband on the original date and I could still get the deal I was promised I just had to book it through the advisor, they then hung up and I was left confused, I rang back up and none of this was possible, A complaint went in and went to the offline team to investigate hoping they would honour what they promised after listening to the phone call, I had a phone call from the offline team just to say sorry, nothing else, pointless, if you want false promises and useless staff, BT is for you!!"
mr angry 77,truro,2/1/18,"absolute pile of junk ,i got wifi so i could watch a few films etc ,even with full signal all movies constantly buffering ,customer service couldnt even find my account ,now im stuck for 12 mths on a crap network with no signal and to top it all they tell you if you cancel you will have to pay the whole 12 mths what a cheek ."
Frsutrated in Kent,Kent,2/1/18,"Sailing into third week without broadband. No one at BT seems to have a clue. Engineer has been out (spent 3 hours 'fixing' something. Was told all we had to do was call BT to resolve it their end. Here we are nearly 5 days later, still waiting for BT wholesale to assign and engineer. I'd move service provider at a heartbeat if they weren't going to get me on charges."
Mamadu,Wakefield,1/31/18,
Robert Punter,Bury St. Edmunds,1/31/18,"I have now placed an order for fibre broadband with BT 4 times. The first two orders apparently didn't reach the engineers (I need fibre cable installing to my property). The only way I discovered this was because I called them to check on progress. The third attempt looked good, I received confirmation email almost immediately. Within 24 hours I then received another email saying the engineers needed to conduct a survey and therefore I had to change the installation date. Each application takes almost an hour, so by then I had lost 3 hours of my life. So I cancelled.
As I can only get fibre cable to my property by applying through BT, I tried again yesterday; order placed after a mere 45 minutes. I have still to receive the confirmation email which I was assured would be with me almost immediately. I am therefore confident this fourth order is not progressing but can I be arsed to chase them yet again? No.
I'll stick with Talktalk and their abysmally slow broadband speed, but at least they are competent."
Chris bailey,Poole,1/31/18,Attempted to switch to BT because of a very good money back deal. A painful month followed of phone calls to their customer service line and 3 wait in all day visits. One of which they didnt turn up for. Appalling customer care. Just don't do it.
Laszlo,London,1/30/18,"I have made lots of poor mistakes in my life, but joining BT is one of the worst. I was a customer with TalkTalk for 10 years and very few issues with them.

Unless you want to constantly lied to you than join BT. Over connection issues I have rung BT numerous times and they always give different answers. Every single time you have to explain the whole situation as they do not update the accounts.


I have been waiting 1 month and half to get my landline and broadband installed in Wembley and they have not even started yet!!!

Ryan McIver,St Helens,1/29/18,"Would not recommend BT. Have been a broadband customer since May 2017, just moved house to be hit with a load of trouble from BT. I have been paying for internet for over a month now and been unable to use it. It took them over 2 weeks (of cancelling our appointments on several occaisions, which may I add myself and my partner had to book time off work to fit around these appointments, only to be told on the day they are now not coming) just to get our line up and running. Now the line is finally up and running, the BT box is just flashing purple and not working. We have tried online chat several times to which we get told ""We will calll you tomorrow"" only to not recieve a call and have to go through the whole process again, in which still now we are waiting for a phonecall!
We get text messages claiming they have called us and can't get through, however, no missed calls on our call logs. If something isnt done immediately, we are going to take the matter into our own hands and seek legal expertise advice. My partner and I can both work from home and are unable to due to the lack of Wi-Fi, which we pay £35 a month for, RIP OFF!!"
Ryan McIver,Haydock,1/29/18,"Up until last month I never had a problem with the company, then I had to move house. This is where all the problems started.
I moved End of December, to then get told I have to wait 24 days for an engineer to come out, so I booked the day off work and the day comes around for me to then look online to see they had cancelled my engineer. I contact them, they then re-schedule (so I had to take yet another UNPAID day off). There excuse was that they activated a line (which i never had). So the reschedule date was 2 days after. The engineer came, struggled to locate the ports, asked my partner where she thought it may be, drilled 2 massive holes straight through my wall, to figure that the ports wasn’t correct. (Partially filled them up).
Eventually the engineer located a smashed up port box, fitted a new one and connected everything up. But STILL the internet didn’t work, I contacted BT online support once a day for 3 days, each day they said they tried contacting me on my old number (which I updated 3 times)!!!! The last attempt they said they would call me within the next few hours - which they didn’t. Figures there is a network fault on their side. Too add onto it all they have put extra charges on my bill for internet that I’ve not been able to use! Oh and also, BT support needs fluent English speaking phone operators cause all 3 that dealt with my case didn’t have a clue what I was talking about (and apparently didn’t know how to update phone numbers)
If you want good customer service and problems to get solved quickly go somewhere else as British Telecoms are shocking!!!!!!"
Joe Brennan,Draycott Derby,1/27/18,Used to use BT fibre optic at my old property. Speeds were running low alot of the time. Called up to report a problem and they talked me through it on the phone. I fixed it myself then they still sent an engineer and billed me anyway £152. The engineer wasn't needed but they still sent him and charged me for it. Do not waste your time with this company absolute rip off.
Ron Cleary,Surrey,1/26/18,
Jonathan B8509,Kings Lynn,1/26/18,"Left BY after many painful (really painful) years. Even transferred to a business account in the hope of getting better customer service.

Over a year my broadband speed degraded from 15 megs (for the previous 2 years) to 8 Megs. BT maintained this was the 'New' operating level.

Left for John Lewis Broadband and after 3 months and 3 engineers visits (without talking to any overseas call centres) and relatively painless communication with JLB my broadbamd restored to 18 meg connection.

Shame on u BT!"
Danny,Essex,1/24/18,"Having been with BT twice over two separate 12 month periods, I have to say the company as a whole is TERRIBLE.
I have no idea how the staff pay structure works but I am going to guess that they get a financial incentive to extend or sign up customers to longer contracts.

My first experience was that I had ordered broadband, and having not received my hub on the date given, I called up and asked.
Only then to find two boxes arrived. I called up and spoke to an Indian call centre to find he has signed me up for a new contract.
This happens 4 times over a 6 week period. I had 4 running contracts running at the same time and was a huge ache to then revert back to my original sign up date, as all they wanted to do was start my contract date from the last one they had wrongly issued me.
On my most recent experience, having signed up for a 12 month contract, I had problems with my speeds and called them after a week. They said they will give me the faster service (for £x extra) which I agreed to. That was pretty much it.
When it come to cancel my 12 month contract, I was informed that I had agreed to sign up for an 18 month contract when my speed was increased.
Something not mentioned once.

There is no integrity in the staff whom represent this shocking company.

Speeds are ok but intermittent.
Customer services is cr4p"
Matt E,Berkshire,1/24/18,"Constantly cuts out, customer services takes an age to contact and when you do get through they are absolutely hopeless. Only with them to get BT Sport, changing to another provider next available opportunity. Poor product, terrible service."
jamie garfield,uk gloucester,1/23/18,Moved into my new house had bt setup my broadband fine no problem 1 week later they cut off my broadband for no reason at all when I rang they said that they had tried to reactivate the line and cocked it up I would have to wait 72 hours for a specialist team to call 1 week later still no call so I phone bt they put me on hold and cut me off five times when I finally got to speak to someone they said I will have to wait another week for a engineer and they would charge me 130 pound luckily for me I was still in cool down period needless to say I have now canceled bt and am waiting for virgin to set me up next week.customer service from bt is none existent please do not even think of using bt they are a disgrace any other company is better
Russell,Fleet,1/23/18,"Terrible. Slow and expensive. Infinity signal does not even go from one side of our house to the other. Unable to send e-mails since installation (can receive).
I work from home often, but broadband keeps cutting out half way through quote, so have to keep starting again.
Installing engineer was extremely rude to us and our neighbours, called them a four letter word. Made complaint but this was not followed up."
Adrian Fitzsimmons,Failsworth,1/22/18,"Not only do BT feel it's OK to increase the price of their sub par broadband product, but they also find it very easy to cap speeds whenever they find fit. I have never bought a broadband product from anybody and received such a bad experience."
Rebecca,Scotland,1/22/18,Terrible customer service. BT left me with no broadband for 6 weeks because they said it was an Open reach problem and Open reach said it was a BT problem (even though there the same company) I was passed from person to person hung up on 6 times and promised 7 call backs that I never received. And when enquired about cancelling my contract I was told I would have to pay the cancellation charges even though they weren’t providing me with the service I was paying for. When they finally fixed the problem a very rude manger said all they could offer as compensation was my money back for 4 of the weeks did not have service and that money would only be offered as credit on my BT account not put back into my bank account. They also charged me a extra £130 for an engineer visit that was supposed to be free because my home hub was not working and when I asked for that money back they said they couldn’t do it because the ONE person out of the whole company that can do that wasn’t in. So I still have not got my money back because that one person still is not in and they’re basically refusing to give it back. I would STRONGLY advise anyone considering BT as there broadband provider to go else where. They are a joke and will just take you for a ride to try and get as much money out of you as possible.
DRB,GRAVESEND,1/21/18,"BT are not cheap, they claim broadband speed up to 50mps, every time I check mine I just about get 17. So why should I pay out over £50 a month for such a slow speed. If I complain they say its my line in the house ,they offer to send a engineer out to look and want to charge even more money. Also if you have a long contract they can still put their prices up at any time.I would not recommend BT."
Kirstie Swift,Scunthorpe,1/18/18,"Terrible customer service. Too many departments and people passing the blame. If something goes wrong with your account it takes phone call after phone call before anything is sorted and nobody gets back to you as promised.

Most of the customer service team are polite but are using a system that is a complete shambles."
Steve Neylan,Rotherham,1/18/18,"What can I say and where do I start . I went with BT June 2016 I was an ongoing With Cancer Treatments, I had to have a large section off 1 side off my Face Removed . So there would be numerous Maxifacial Plastic and Optimology work to be carried out . Unfortunately I am Lao a Transplant patient. During the numerous ops Mum and Dad botched died in October 2017 with cancer within 8 days off each other . I was backwards and forwards also to the Hospital. Finances spiralled out off control . I phoned BT in January to pay £207.00 they said they had Terminated the Contract. I now owed £429.00 but no Service or House Phone . There attitude was appalling . But there was nothing they could do . I do not claim Any Benefits or get Financial Help . The Hospital say I am Vulnerable living on my own . The Jury is out . I rest my case .

BARBARA,Swansea,1/18/18,"Paying for Fibre and we have about 50% service. Less when it is a busy time. BT Customer Service say all the right things but rarely act on what thet say. They always seem reluctant to get Outreqach involved, my guess is that since they are now 2 different companies BT has to pay a charge."
Laura,Scarborough area,1/17/18,I am absolutly disgusted with this company. Its an absolute joke. We signed up in September and after issues with them connecting us its been one thing after another. We are still waiting on a £45 reward back due to how much of a mess around we have had. We repeatedly had to chase everything up and each time speaking to someone different. Once our contract is over we will be going elsewhere. If I wasnt so annoyed I would laugh at how pathetic this company really is. The last time we were with BT they used to up the bill without notifiying and thats why we switched over. This time round we thought we will give them another try and we wish we hadnt!
Lea Herlihhy,Southport,1/16/18,We have been without broadband for 6 days as BT disconnected are connection after we asked to change provider! As offcom say your provider should keep you connected until your new provider take over. BT have broken the terms and conditions of our contract and we are still waiting for a call from case management but we have been told this can take up to 48hrs! Considering they are a multinational telecommunications company trying to get them to put this right is impossible please take note of this comment as they should not be able to get away with this service and we will be handing over our complaint to Ofcom
Terence,london,1/15/18,When it works it's not to bad...but operative word is 'when'. They are a law unto themselves and like all major corporations answer to no one. Customer service is zero... all you can do is just wait until they are ready to provide you with the service they charge an arm ans a leg for...gangsters
Gina Johnston,London,1/13/18,"OMG if anyone wants to get Broadband from BT - DON’T, been with them over 15 years and my B.B. went down between Christmas and New Year, first call for anyone employed was for today, so 2 weeks later, I waited for someone to come to be today, then first call “yes they are coming give them to 9am”, second call “oh it wasn’t booked properly so can’t do it till next Saturday”

Now three weeks no internet and used phone data and been told will not be reimbursed for that either. So Customer Services now less than 0%.

Sorry forgot to advised been on phone to them for over 4 hours all in all. So save yourself from the frustration and go hit your head against a wall as you will end up with the same pain. Go with any other supplier as though their customer service is also rubbish you will save some money.

Very frustrated BT loyal (until now), customer"
Kevin Rodgers,Kent,1/12/18,"Bottom line: avoid like the plague.

My story.

Have had BT phone line and 'copper' broadband for 13 years in a rural location. Speed and reliability poor (1-4 Mbps, flaky, frequent dropouts) but what can you do deep in the countryside? Then, excitement! Fibre has come to our hamlet. We applied for BT Infinity. 4th Jan it gets turned on. Nothing. We have no broadband at all.
We book an OpenReach engineer to come the next morning (if 8am-1pm is 'morning'). I take the day off work. No engineer. BT have cocked up booking him. They reschedule for the next Thursday 11th. Another day off. Engineer rocks up past midday. He works for a couple of hours. ""There is no way for you to get Infinity - the wiring of the boxes is all wrong. They shouldn't have sold it to you"". Nothing to be done: going back to copper next week (I hope).

I lodged a formal complaint. Now we're arguing about compensation. What's their offer to compensate me for two days off work, at least 2 weeks without internet and 4-5 hours on the phone? £20. I've told them to think again.

Utterly disorganised, useless, incompetent rabble. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."
Esther,London,1/11/18,"Avoid at all costs! Horrendous customer service!
Initial connection took ages. Then they charged me before I ever got it, I called to complain and they told me to wait they'd fix the bill. In the meantime broadband was finally setup (for two days) then they cut the line cause they said I haven't paid the bill (of the internet I never had! First month's bill was something over £32 for basic speed, *up to 17Mb and phone line no special extras! Then after all that they charged me something over £15 for late payment!"
S,Heathfield East sussex,1/11/18,"Fibre ordered 11th November 2017...as for years have had max of 1.5 speed here..Instead BT cut off my broadband totally 15th Nov to 15th Dec ...HOURS of phone calls after days at work to BT, & Openreach (for which privilege I am charged!)all over country & India, numerous promises of switch on and help, and repeats by myself that we have NO fibre and never had engineer call to fit box inside or out...achieved no fibre and a month to reconnect copper..stress all round as little signal on mobiles either. Children's A levels falling behind as all on line. Still no fibre it appears it's a ""records issue"" and I have to wait yet again... My patience with such an inept ""business"" is running out. Any other business would be closed down."
Marty,Bridlington,1/11/18,"It's obvious from the plethora of terrible reviews that BT suck. I agree that BT most definitely does suck. How is my £15 mobile phone internet faster on tethering than my £70 a month BT Fibre?! The staff on the phones pass you pillar to post with infrastructure problems whether you're contracted or not and can be unpleasant, along with crappy long queue times to do even the most simple account checks. Save yourself some time, choose ANY OTHER PROVIDER. You might save enough time to learn a new language, or maybe knit a jumper. Or at least you'll have a router provided that doesn't cut out exactly at the most important part of every show and video game you will ever be part way through. What's weird is that I'm not even a biased or negative person!"
Jeremy,"Alveston, Bristol",1/11/18,What can I say. BT are a shower of s****e. Their broadband is slow in my area and keeps dropping. Since November I have had a faulty land line so no phone/broadband. I have been lied to constantly by an “Executive Level” Customer complaints advisor. So I am “walking” and going off to Virgin Media who activate me on Saturday. The funniest thing is BT Openreach’s sub contractors (Oakus Limited - what a bunch of cowboys) turned up yesterday lunchtime and started digging a trench for a new phone cable. So BT will now have to restore the pavement at the same time as losing a customer!
Jake,blackpool,1/10/18,"Joke !!! don't get BT, I got BT because I watch bt sport and thought it was a better option. I was massively wrong! I'm tied into a 2 year contract that would cost me £500 to cancel !!! my internet is slow !! and BT Freeview is awful !"
Tomek,Norfolk,1/10/18,"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Just don't. You will save yourself a whole load of hassle. Go with someone else. In fact using data on your phone will be a better (not to mention a faster and cheaper) option. We signed up for BT broadband when we moved house. The moment you sign up, the problems will start. You will be greeted by incompetent customer service staff who either cannot, or will not help you. The reoccurring theme throughout your experience will be this;
1- There is a problem with your internet/phone service, so you call up BT
2- You will spend 10 - 20 minutes on hold
3- A non native English speaker on a bad line will answer your call. After answering your questions with quotes from a script, they will put you though to the relative department
4- You will spend ANOTHER 5-15 minutes on hold.
5- A slightly more competent person will pick up. Sometimes they're able to understand you, sometimes you'll be able to understand them, either way after listening to your complaint/query, they will give you answers from a script. If you're dissatisfied with their answers, they can;
A- put you though to the complaints department (WASTE OF TIME!!! These guys are masters of bullsht and will have you hanging up in no time in the false hope that your problem will be solved. I found this to be the worst department of all, they lie though their teeth just to get you off the line!)
B- Go and 'look on the system to see what the problem is' Exactly what these people do when they say they'll do this is a mystery. Naturally they will put you on hold AGAIN while this takes place and at the end your problem still wont get solved.
At this point, you will have been on the phone for around an hour (40 mins if you're lucky) and you have TWO options-
hang up and go back to 1
Stay on the line and go back to 4
I have wasted far too much of my life trying to sort out problems after problems that I can honestly say no other company has. After months of frustrations, we went with someone else. 7 days later, we have fast fibre! Suck it BT, you're a joke."
Andrew griffiths,Pontypridd,1/10/18,Really bad service. Supposed to get up to 52mbps for 'super fast broadband but getting only 7mbps. Engineers called out 4 times. Previously had 32mbps but keeps dropping back down shortly after engineer 'fixes it. Expensive for poor service. They charge loyal customers more than new ones. I wouldn't recommend BT.
A. Brown,West stockwith,1/7/18,By absolutely rubbish - current download speed 0.6 mb just not good enough for anything and spending £50 a month for nothing!! Total waste of money!
Kerr,UK,1/7/18,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. The operators never do as they promise.
I had to cancel twice and even then they got the date wrong.
I was billed incorrectly and promised a refund (even have the email proving it) but instead was billed again and told it was to late to stop that payment.
Cannot put into this short review just how useless this company has been."
Colin Mathews,East Runton,1/4/18,"Been waiting for 3 months for open reach to repair my phone line. After numerous engineers I don’t have a constant phone line, broadband spends more time down than up. I payed for infinity to get new hub due to an engineer saying my old one was faulty (didn’t cure my problem) hence I still get 1.6 download Av, when working."
Paul Swindells,Chester,1/1/18,BT is a joke. When we first moved to them from Sky they said it would cost £34.99 per month but since then it's been nearly £50 every month. We called to bring this up and they said it was correct. So we thought we will bide our time and move when 12 month contract finished. They are now saying we can't terminate because I am using the bt sport app and from the day I downloaded it the 12 month contract started again. This is total rubbish I never signed no extension. They are asking for £170 to come out. Please do not go with bt they don't give a **** about their customers. Bigest mistake we ever made
Jay,London,1/1/18,Bt big rip off. Sky high prices. Daylight robbery.
Rishi,Warwickshire,12/31/17,"Tried to cancel within the 14 day period. Emailed confirmed cancellation but they did not act upon it. I was left with BT Broadband for a month. Requested to transfer to another provider which they had to accept. But as soon as I did so, broadband became very slow. Webpages and emails took many minutes. Doesn't appear to be a ""good company"". It is unfortunate that BT owns the phone lines. Its min broadband speed is 1M. So you will only get a refund it is below this. If you can find a better provider you might want to switch."
Alan,Cirencester,12/31/17,
Lars1313,South Wales,12/30/17,"BT Broadband - 2 months of broadband failure. Been told fault on line after several engineer visits, but still not fixed. Have rung up to 30+ times to have signal reset inc 3 calls on Xmas day! Disgusting customer service throughout. No apology and had to ‘barter’ for limited compensation to cover costs and get broadband payments refunded. Lack of interest in trying to resolve issue has been astounding and after being told yesterday the fault had been fixed, it went again today! Can’t even leave for different supplier as the fault is in exchanfge or on the line. BT may have the best coverage, but are not interested if there is a fault."
Mike Fox,Llangollen,12/29/17,Excellent service - just waiting for infinity
thomas,Margaretting,12/29/17,"since the release of fibre in our area the speed has been great and reliability good. Until the 23rd of December, since then wemve had no connection and BT’s unbelievable lack of ability to do anything about it has left my completely gobsmacked. I’ve been told its an area fault, I’ve been told its a property fault, I’ve been told it’ll be fixed in 24 hours, twice. Then wednesday, then I made a formal complaint, this somewhat esculated their attention span, with a call back on Friday (today) after the problem would definitely be fixed, to no avail, now its Friday night and I have to wait until Tuesday. I’ve been told openreach do work the weekend, but for limited reasons, apparently a £60 a month customer for god knows how long doesn’t warrant that sort of attentipn despite being without service for a week. Just unbelievable"
Donna,Liverpool,12/29/17,"Awful service , do not go with BT. I arranged to change over to Bt, got the set up date , confirmation email , equipment and they cancelled my order due to sky not releasing the line until the day after. They did not inform me of this until I rang up on the day it was meant to go live and asked why my broadband had not gone on. Told me I had to re order in 2 more days, when I did this then they said they could not put my phone /broadband and tv on for another 3 weeks. After many phone calls with staff who did not care or take ownership I went back to sky as I did not want to give them my business. I have never experienced such bad service and would never recommend BT ."
Steve,,12/28/17,"Called BT to enquire about installing broadband in our new build house, was pleasantly surprised at how helpful and knowledgable the 2 people I spoke to were, very polite and resolved my questions, couldn’t fault the customer service we received."
Mark Paul,West Sussex,12/28/17,"Broadband works okay at quiet times. However, at peak periods, it can be very difficult to watch iPlayer etc."
Adrian,LEEDS,12/28/17,"I have experienced some difficulty with buffering of my broadband from time to time and more recently over the Christmas period. I checked my current monthly price and noticed that it has risen to over £40. I have checked the lastest deals with some being cheaper than my own but offering better connectivity etc.
When I spoke to a BT representative to question my account I was told that because I have been outy of contract for a long period of time that the best deal they could offer me was a £7 discount. Hows that for being a 10- 15 year loyal customer.
I asked if he could offer a better deal than that but was told that ""THE COMPUTER SAYS NO!!!!""
I will of course change provider.
It seems that being a long term loyal customer means nothing these days. Not good enough BT."
Mick,Nottingham,12/25/17,"Other than the broadband being really slow despite living in the city centre, I had an awful experience cancelling it, on the edge of scamming.

I tried to cancel it before my one year period expired, and I was told I have to pay a cancellation fee, which makes perfect sense. So I decided to wait for the 12 months to pass, still paying monthly even if I wasn't really using it. Fine.

After the one year period passed, I called again to finally cancel my broadband: the customer service told me that the contract automatically extended for another year, and if I wanted to end I had to pay the same big fee I had been trying to avoid by keeping my contract active at my expense.

These are the kind of things which you have to be very careful of, designed to screw money off you. Therefore I feel scammed, I will pay the exit fee but I will never ever recommend BT to anybody, as my experience has been awful."
Stephen,Manchester,12/23/17,
David,Newport,12/22/17,"High and increasing costs, slow rubbish connection for both phone and TV. Picture breaks up on HD Channels epsecially.

Also had no end of nuisance calls, they register your number with random business so that they think you are a client or a service provider. I think they do this so you pay extra for 'no nuisance calls'

Please, please avoid at all costs."
Cliff Jones,Cilcain,12/21/17,"Shockingly, shockingly bad. Getting 2MB in a 20MB package when people in the same area are reaching 10-16MB. Add to that constant dropouts for a minute or more every 15 minutes.

Went through various procedures with someone in India for 3 days, trying everything, only for him to conclude that he couldn't fix it, but the system wouldn't allow him to book an engineer visit. Asked to speak to a supervisor, and line was cut. Sent a complaint - no answer.

Woeful. The worst experience of Broadband in 15 years."
Pat Dodds,Wormegay,12/21/17,

Mr Mohammed Islam,Glasgow,12/18/17,"BT is officially the worst internet provider I have had at my property since the last 14 years. Virgin media, Sky, Talk talk all internet providers that I have had over the space of numerous years I can't emphasise enough how bad your service for internet is..., but I will put it to comparison. My 3 from my mobile is quicker than your service I get 29.00-35mb never lags or lets me down. How do I know ?, by having to pay additional £5 everyday for internet that I have paid for which is shocking. Some will say why would you ?, 1. I have 3 kids, 2. 1 off which at high school needs it for history essay 3. At uni needs for reasearch, 3rd 1 needs it for cumputer games, my tv connects to the internet so everything me or my misses can't watch nothing, i need to the internet for work but I can't use it becouse my phone has become a wifi hotspot completely shocking and it's not just 1 day 3 days, it's been over a week !"
William,West Lothian,12/18/17,"Upon advising BT I was moving to another provider they cancelled my services and line. This was despite me specifically advising I would be making a working line transfer/takeover.

In my opinion the agent's actions were intentional and malicious. As it prevented an order being placed by another company - resulting in a two week gap without phone or broadband.

Intentional or not, the 'mistake' as acknowledged by BT could have reckless consequences. We have two children and being contactable - and able to make calls is very important.

I strongly recommend avoiding BT."
Collins,BAGILLT,12/17/17,worst internet ever i was with talktalk before at least they were cheaper and did fix problems stuck with bt at moment paying for a service im not getting speeds are 0.52 at best
Fed up,Rural Wales,12/16/17,"BT fibre box at our gate but not ""available"" after a year, then charged £730 / year for lowest non-fibre package inc 2 landline charges for same line to get a phone & limited (12 Gbytes/month). Ripoff for rural OAPs and no way to get sense from BT. And they want £30+ more from January 18. Changing supplier asap."
Giles Robinson,Greenford,12/16/17,slow speeds and there will not give me fiber at my address even then the box to give me fiber is just in the next street.
JMansfield,Essex,12/15/17,"The Wpic saga of trying to get our broadband connected continues. After being notified that we were to be connected on the 12th of Dec by midnight, then notified again by text on the 13th of Dec that we were to be connected, I called early on the 14th to find our order was ""fake"". The whole order had to be re-processed (it had already been delayed by five days). Our new date is the 2nd of Jan. Highly annoying with two kids to entertain (Netflix), visiting parents who want to Skype and expensive having to purchase extra phone memory. Cheers BT for nothing. The call centre has been a customer service disaster zone. My advice avoid BT like the plague for broadband, there's a reason they rank so poorly in reviews. They've certainly tarnished our Xmas to a degree."
Dave M,Somerset,12/14/17,"Dreadful company , ""foreign"" custmoer service the worst I have ever dealt with. Just read from a sheet and dont actually listen. Very poor quality of service down to BT openreach frequent bodged cable repars.

Andy,Bristol,12/14/17,"Router Doesn't work with Macs. [Managed to write that sentence before; for the 8th time in the last hour the router crashed for everything - so let's hope I can post this].

Oooh - I have a connection, so I'll try to hit send!! Nope, I tried to check my text, and the connection was lost again. Blue!.. send...."
Sophie,Worcestershire,12/13/17,"God only help you if you ever have a problem with your internet service. When it's all running smooth I can't really complain, pretty standard internet. The problem with this abysmal company is the customer support.

What an absolutely agonising ordeal you have to go through with a bunch of un-trained monkeys. Yes, absolute monkeys reading out of a book.
About half a year ago I had exactly the same problem - my internet dropping off and spiking up and down aswell as my router restarting itself. Last time I had to go through the cycle of Indians (people i sincerely CANNOT understand) and wait three weeks for an engineer.

This time however I was greeted by a decent sounding guy called Liam, who clearly lived in the UK. These people DO NOT want to help you at all! They are working for probably next-to minimum wage pressing buttons trying to fob people off. Absolutely ATROCIOUS service. It took 5-10 minutes of tests and stuff just for this man to tell me everything looked okay, but when I argued with him and asked ''Surely you can see my connection dropping on your screen'' his reply was just ''Yes, I can''.

Soon after this, I was then told I could get an engineer out to my house! (yay!)... Shortly followed by ''but if the fault doesn't lie within BT's end, you'll be charged £130''.

I really have nothing else to say about this absolutely disgusting company. DO NOT Entertain getting internet from these apes."
Bilyana,London,12/12/17,"Pasting the e-mail I sent to BT below:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am not sure where to begin. I have suffered two panic attacks today, cried a lot and spent 4+ hours on the phone and on online chat to your advisors.

The service I have received is absolutely disgusting. I cannot believe the customer service team at such a big firm is so useless and incompetent.

It all started when I wanted to submit an order for moving home. My address was not on the list so I had to do it over the phone. After waiting an insane amount of time I was redirected 5-6 times to different teams. Finally, it seemed like I am seeing light at the end of the tunnel. A very nice lady promised me she submitted my order and that she booked in an engineer for 2nd Jan. This was not ideal for me but it was the best they could do. She also assured me my new address has the fiber service available.

At this point I thought it was done. After not receiving an email with my order for 15 mins I decided to check my online account. Surprise - the offer said rejected! I immediately called again. This time it only took 29 minutes to reach the correct team. We started again with the order - it turned out my new flat does not have fibre and would not be able to transfer my current broad band and TV package. The lady suggested some other options which were available - at this point I agreed to anything. I was crying on the phone and I just wanted to sort things out. She then says my engineer appointment would now be 9th Jan. At this point I was breaking down - this meant I could not work for an extra week (I use WiFi for my job). I had no other option - I had to agree. She then put me on hold and the waiting began once again. After long 17 minutes she says: ""Im sorry but it appears I cannot submit this order, I really have no idea why."" As you can imagine, the 9th of Jan slot now seemed like a dream - it seemed like even in February I will not have internet. This was my breaking point and I decided to cancel my contract all together. The assistant told me since you can no longer provide me the same services at my new home I will be able to cancel free of charge with a 30 day notice period. This meant I would pay some extra weeks but I didn't care. We agreed the services will stop on 2 Jan and I will pay until 12 Jan. She told me it's done and wished me to feel better. I think she actually really felt bad that I was crying because of the obvious incompetency of these people.
After the call I was beginning to calm down. The contract was cancelled so I went ahead and arranged another firm.
I was scrolling through my emails when I saw my confirmation of stopped services. I was relieved. I did not want to even open the email - I had such hatred in my head still. But I opened it - and almost had a heart attack. The email said my services will stop on 20th December?????? Not only that but as a Christmas present maybe I had to pay almost £700. Imagine my shock. Immediately, for the 16th time that day I connected to the online chat. Of course they couldn't help because I needed the FTTF team. And so the waiting to connect to this magical team began once again. This one was actually not too bad - only 14 minutes. I gave my details and the agent said she will check in a minute and come back. Once again I had entered the dangerous game of being on hold. At one point I considered hanging up but I decided to persist. After 20 minutes of checking my account she came back to say she could not amend this order and has no idea why it went wrong. The solution is to cancel the order which will take two days and then on Saturday when she is back in office she will try to re-submit the order. I had no option so have to trust that she will do that.
In the meantime I am left with an incredible amount of stress - I still do not know what will happen and I am disgusted with the treatment I have received. I am still shaking and crying - I am as helpless in this situation as useless are your employees. I am now actually considering becoming a BT employee only to be able to fix my issue.

I didn't know where to start and I do not know where to end. I guess I will just say again how extremely disappointed I am especially being a customer for some time. I am hopeful that one day my contract will be cancelled successfully and I will never have to interact with you ever again.

Kinds regards,
Bilyana Karadzhova

Martin,Plymouth,12/11/17,"Worst experience with any company I think I’ve ever endured and I rarely complain about anything. I booked in to connect to a new property as I was moving, did this well in advance and was set with a connection date. Was asked to stay in between 8-1 on this date. So I stayed in and no one came between 8-1. Called half hour later to be told by engineer he was stuck on a job and it would be given to another engineer. In contact with BT on and off but not getting any definites. Original engineer turned up a couple of hours later and did something to the socket in the flat then went out to the box on the street. A couple of hours later come back in saying fault on line and while most of this sorted out, they needed access to a communal cupboard which I didn’t have access to so an appointment would be arranged. Heard nothing back again the next day so contacted and was told nothing had been arranged. They made arrangements while I was on phone to come back and told me explicitly that I didn’t need to be in, that they needed access to communal cupboard and this would be sorted by them. Come home to find a missed appointment card (I didn’t have a missed appointment) and called and was told I’d have active services by midnight. I tried explaining situation to be told that the line would be active and not to worry. The line was not active the next day. Called back and was told that an engineer needed access to the communal cupboard, I explained the situation (again) and so a date was set for a week despite me explaining my autistic son was staying for weekend and the issues this would cause. The advisor did send me money to pay for a mi-fi device but the data on this was eaten within a night. Today was the date the engineer was sorting out whatever needed sorting in the communal cupboard. Had a number of missed calls (I was in training) and when I called back engineer said he couldn’t access my flat. I explained (yet again) that I was not asked to be in the flat, that they just needed access to the cupboard to be told that there wasn’t an issue with anything in the cupboard, the fault was within the flat (that the first engineer had come in and apparently sorted). He said to call BT and rearrange another appointment. I contacted BT and while helpful and friendly, the customer service advisor told me they openreach had me down as missed appointments and as such the next appointment they would be able to set was for the 27th (it’s the 11th today). Despite my protests, explaining that none of this was my fault, she was unable to do anything about it.

The issue has been poor communication all the way through, and to be told I’m being noted as at fault when I’ve been told I don’t need to be at the flat for the appointment is just plain ridiculous. As I think someone else said, one star is still way to high a rating for a shambolic experience - the only positives I can think of is that the customer advisors have been friendly enough but being friendly hasn’t got my service running."
Josh,Burgess Hill,12/11/17,"Oh, boy, where to begin. One starring everything would be too much of a compliment. This company is a disaster, and cannot adhere to their own packages and promises. I have had nothing but issues with BT internet since I first achieved it. Packet loss, frequent disconnections, unexplainable cut outs throughout the whole neighbourhood. Sky seems to be the only internet near me which remains up when all others go down. I and other family members have rung up countless of BT support members, who ask us questions relating to the cloud coverage in the sky, wind speed and the atmosphere. They usually go on to say it is the clouds (even if there are barley any in the sky) or due to atmospheric pressure, then put the phone down apologising. Not a single inch of effort is provided during these phone calls, and the tone of their voice is depressing. For the people who we have had around, they do some tests, and at best have replaced our router to no avail. They get paid more than a practitioner and an NHS worker, for being incompetent, useless and sometimes even unresponsive. Any muppet can walk into a house, check a routers lights, then walk back out, where's the professionalism? There isn't any. Do not join this company with any packages that they offer, they are greedy liars and promise lies. They are unreliable and there are plenty of other companies whom offer a better deal in terms of speed and money."

James,NORTHAMPTON,12/1/17,Just don't even bother with BT. The shameful state of play is that BT have the monopoly and no matter what company you use (other then Virgin) BT will be charging their lines out and earning money from it. Basically this means they can provide you the lowest level of service and a product that is completely unfit for purpose and still charge hand over fist for it. Disgusting company. 0/10
Tom,Godalming,12/1/17,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS
You may be lucky and everything works ok. That’s what I thought. Always had great internet with every other provider. But Jesus Christ this lot are terrible. And the Indian call centre doesn’t help.

James,Belfast,11/30/17,"VERY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Avoid using BT for Broadband.
Had BT Broadband 6 Months it's been down for 3 times for a week at a time. Been told that no compensation will be given for the first 2 days each time it's been down as the engineers are allowed 2 days to resolve any issues.After that it's just over one pound per day that I have been offered. I was told I could get 50+MBs but can only get around 10Mbs when it's working which is not very often. It went down again this week. I called to inform them that it's going very slow and dropping out and was told that it's not down the speed you are getting 0.14Mbs means that you still have Broadband service, so we are not going to do anything!!. After 3 calls I was finally put through to complaints I said I have paperwork that says I can get 50Mbs. The call adviser said I have just tested your line and you can get 1Mb which is all that we guarantee!!.You have too many devices connected ( I only had 1 Laptop) I said that's not the speed the paperwork states. Her reply was I will disconnect your broadband I can easily do it. is that want you want me to do? Worst customer service I have ever had and this was from an adviser in the UK!!. Who threatens to leave you with no broadband at all rather than try to help."
Jeremy,Hinxton,11/28/17,"When first installed my Infinity 2 service was providing 72mb/s, but after 6 months the service fell to 50mb/s, which because it counts as being within BT limits, they are not interested in fixing.

After an area power cut, the service was restored to 72mb/s for a couple of weeks, confirming that the performance loss is due to interference, rather than an outright technical fault."
amber,kilmarnock,11/28/17,i have just recently joined bt the internet was ok for a while but i havent had the internet for 8 days now and i have sat in my house for 3 days waiting on an engineer coming out to sort it customer services booked my 3 appointments for 8 to 1 slots and not one engineer came and everytime i call them its the same **** all the time this is the a horrible company
D,Manchester,11/28/17,"Fine when everything is working as it should..... BUT when there's a problem you're screwed. If are lucky enough to actually speak to someone on the phone (their ""chat"" service is useless) you'd be lucky if they actually listen to you before pretending to put you through to another department only to end the call. The customer care centre is obviously based in India and, although they speak far better English than I do their language, there are issues lost in translation here also. I have tried over 2 days to report a serious data protection breach where I recieved lots of sensotive data belonging to a third party and have got absolutely nowhere. The only advice I was given was to ""change my password"" which is obviously nothing to do with the issues I was reporting."
Unknown,Essex,11/27/17,"NEVER JOIN BT!!!

0 Star Service!

I have been with BT for a few years now and the WiFi always worked fine until about a year ago.. the WiFi started being really slow but took no notice of it until 2 months ago when I had to reset my hub every day for it to work. In the past 2 months I have been on the phone to BT about 30 times.
They have run checks on the hub over the phone, said they’ve fixed it from there end. It then worked for about 2 days and completely stopped working again.
Then called again, they decided to send us a new cable because apparently that would help the problem, did not help the problem at all.
Then of course, call AGAIN.. They finally sent an engineer out, they gave us a new hub but said there is a problem with the line outside and that another engineer will come out to fix that later on the same day... Guess what, no engineer turned up.
I called BT again, they re-arranged another engineer to come the following day... no one turned up
Phoned yet again, they said an engineer is coming ‘tomorrow’ the engineer finally turned up to ‘fix the outside line’. The WiFi didn’t work until 2 days after, I had so much hope thinking the problem would be fixed. After all of this our WiFi worked fine for 3 days, on the 4th day it was back down again.
Whenever I’ve been on the phone to people they’re useless, they don’t even offer a discount on your bill considering your paying each month and revieving NO WIFI at all!!!
They are a joke and they don’t take you seriously at all!!"
Chris,Kent,11/27/17,I have a BT contract that runs until January 2018 for which my partner and I pay by DD monthly. Having just moved house we decided to go with a more competitive supplier but accepted we would have to pay up our contract for the 12 months. BT quite rightly have charged us for the final month of our contract but what I find astonishing and quite frankly disgusting is they have further charged me £65 for outstanding equipment! I have offered to return the equipment but the rather abrupt lady stated that could not use it again so I questioned why we were being charged £65 when we were in fact paying up for the 12 month contract to which she replied it was because we left early! I find it absolutely disgusting that we are being charged twice especially when they don’t want the equipment back! I would not recommend BT after this and I certainly will never use them again.
Lucy,Oxfordshire,11/27/17,"Our internet hasn't been working for two weeks, but we've been told we're impatient and do not have a valid reason to be unhappy or make a complaint. This is the second time our internet has stopped working for two weeks since July when we took out the service.

We've been shouted at down the phone my the customer service manager, Arnab and his team and told we've not given them enough time to sort out internet in the TWO WEEKS they've had. We've been hung up on several times, had our calls dropped and experienced the worst customer service ever.

Cannot believe they're trying to charge us £150 to terminate a contract we are paying for but not receiving."
Mary Obrien,Glasgow,11/26/17,I upgraded my WiFi to the fibre On Thursday and I’ve still no internet been on the phone constant complaining not getting anywhere as I’m determined I’m not paying for engineer to come out And the last phone call was a younger man and he was helpful as he said it takes 10 days to connect .As I said why didn’t the other advisors tell me this plus the one that sold me the contract As some of rather advisors are Down right and incompetent and catty And I’ve been a bit customer for 36 years So we will see if it connects in the 10 days will be leaving but when this contract up So I wouldn’t recommend them or use them
E J D,West Midlands,11/25/17,"DO NOT JOIN BT.

I moved to BT purely based on price, about a £2 differential to Virgin media. I regret this. It took over a month to get connected to the internet; with no good reason for the delay provided. I then had to move house about 6months into the contract. At the new house the internet still was not connected, it took over a month AGAIN to get connected. I then got charged £130 for the pleasure of being connected because the landline wasn't connected to the exchange.

In terms of the actual service its average at best. The hub is not that powerful (despite what the adverts show) I live in a fairly standard 4 bed house and required a booster for the router to reach the upstairs bedrooms. The BT TV functionality is not as good as Virgin media. Despite series linking my favourite TV shows its hit and miss whether it records them.

In summary BT provide poor customer experience, it takes an age to get connected, the home Hub and TV services are basic and worst of all they place additional extortionate charges for getting connected."

DO NOT USE BT AT ANY COST"
Andy,Creed,11/23/17,"I have been with BT for a number of years now and although the actual service is ok, the customer service is shocking. When it’s all working well it’s great. But when it’s not and you’re forced to call them, then you get passed from pillar to post and the fault or issue is seldom sorted. Common phrase of theirs is “the system won’t let me” So annoying. Also, the packages for existing customers is poor. You may as well cancel and come back as a new customer for any sort of deal."
Darren,Lincoln,11/23/17,"Absolutely dismal internet, just this side of the old dial-up. Additionally, a fair number of television channels don't work and there is no ability to gain any ""extra"" channels, despite always getting adds for them in the post and email. When discussed with the company, we are told it's part of where we are living and increased speed and packages are not in this area. We live just 10 minutes outside of a city."
Craig C,Ayrshire,11/22/17,"We upgraded to super fast fibre broadband in June. Since then the service we receive is poorer. I have had engineers out, given advice over the phone, been talked through changes to the settings and it has not improved. BT informed me that the figures they quote are for hard wired devices not wireless. They eventually stated that they could not improve the service. So I a, now paying more for a poorer service than I had originally. I was now out of the cooling off period and would be charged £200 to leave the contract. This is not viable. I am now a very unhappy BT customer until June next year when the contract runs out. They offered me a discount on a new 12 month contract which I refused. I will never use BT again and would advise everyone to avoid them like the plague."
Chelsea,Liverpool,11/22/17,Awful services!! No channels work get told on the phone just to watch on catch up? Disgraceful can't wait for my contract to end!!!

Nick,Daventry,11/19/17,"At first I was happy with BT I felt I was getting a great deal, landline and unlimited Internet fibre optic for £46 a month. After a year when my contract ran out they offered me a contract phone for £17 a month with 6gb a month, I took the offer and was also offered for £5 extra I would get unlimited data, I refused it at first thinking I didn't need it due to having my WiFi, but 6gb didn't last long and I noticed when I tried to connect to my BT router it would only connect for 10 seconds and stop and then I would have reconnect again and ive done that ever since I got the contract which was months ago. I remembered the woman offering me unlimited data for £5 a month and I rang up to enquire about the deal, the first guy had nothing on it and connected me to someone else who said to me they don't do unlimited data at all, so either he was unsure of this offer and unlimited data or I was about to get scammed even though the woman knew all about my contract with BT. So in the end I'm stuck with this phone that runs out of data in about 3-4 days which connects to the router for 10 seconds each time and it's a 2 year contract. In the end BT offered me 15gb of data for £27 a month. That's a rip off I've seen better deals on better phones for just £3 more. So either BT fixes my issues or once my contract is over I will be paying someone else for their services which I'll also be recommending to my friends and family too."
HK,London,11/18/17,"Broadband ordered and confirmed on 8 Nov, told the connection would start on 18 Nov. On 9 Nov told got a text to say connection will be on 22 Nov. Then a couple of hours later got a text and email to say connection will be on 13 Dec! Spent ages on the phone to their customer service, finally told connection definitely on 22 Nov. Get an email a few days later saying 13 Dec. More wasted time chasing them, and their rubbish webchat this time. Still can't confirm the order. Incompetent company!"

Paul,London,11/13/17,"Beware BT Cancellation charges SCAM

Don't even bother signing up, even if the telecomms network restricts your choices. Hopefully your mobile data covers you.

My £26.50 a month 12m broadband quickly turned into circa £60/m for 6m with spurious additional charges (£55 free router, £30 disconn fee) once somebody else decided to take over my line after 5 months and I was charged full year.
Shouldn't be legal but according to the ombudsman & BT it is, billing 2 or more people for the same line. Once again the big boys win.
I was later sent a pdf of 155pages of Ts&Cs and guess what, early termination charges are right at the back, albeit unclear to calculate.

Lorna,Lockerbie,11/12/17,"Total disgusting. Phoned on several occasions to say broadband was dropping out to be told all tests were fine. Asked about home bub 6 as knew loads of people with it to be told its only for fibre optic and was asked to upgrade. I told them there was no way i was upgrading as they werent providing me with the service i was already paying for. Reluctently i agreed to an engineer visit after being told by an advisor that if he didnt toucb anything within the property I wouldnt be charged. I took the day off work and an engineer came, went, then came back and said the problem was sorted. It wasnt! A second engineer was booked but i couldnt afford to take another day off work so asked my father to go over. My father has onset dementia so after engineer called to say he was on the way, i called him back to say my dad would no remember to say but he WAS NOT to touch anything in my house till id ok'd it and to phone me first. I got a call half hour later saying he had removed my master socket and leads from back of hub and it should bd fine?? I told him not to touch anyything!. On my return home, my broadband wasnt workibg and there was a hole left in my hall wall! My complaint escalated to a higher department and the upshot was i was offered a hub 6 (strange as id been told i could only get that if i upgraded to fibre optic) and its solved the prob and i got a call saying i had credit for lack of service for months. Today though, ive had £142 taken from my bank for 2nd engineer visit (the 1 thaf desroyed my hall and fixed nowt) and when questioning it got called from some snooty woman saying this is correct!. Im still waiting for my complaint lodged with openreach re engineer who vandalised my home and now im being charged £140 for the pleasure. Customer service is shocking, they dont deserve the money i work hard for"
Nigel Saunders,Burton on Trent,11/12/17,Easily the worst company I have ever dealt with. They lie and never understand your problem .

M,LONDON,11/9/17,Most appalling product and customer experience. Bt fully deserve to go spectacularly bankrupt
Danielle,Surrey,11/8/17,"Absolutely appalled. After having many issues with slow broadband as well as it completely dropping out daily, I called BT to rectify this problem on many occasions. Each time my broadband was tested and the results came back 'fine'. Once it was clear that it most certainly wasn't fine, more testing occurred over 48 hours; of which I was promised a call back. Of course this never happened, and this continued each time I called. I then had to start explaining each time I called that the customer service had been poor and stressed my lack of faith to any call back promised. Of which I was assured they were 'sympathetic' with my situation and past dealings and I most certainly would be getting a call back. Of course this still did not happen. I then turned my attention to the complaints department. After being on the phone for 1 hour and 45 minutes, being passed from pillar to post, I was again assured i would receive a call back the following day, any time time before 9pm. After anxiously awaiting my call back ALL day, they finally called gone 7pm as i was on my way out of the door to a birthday meal. After previously stressing I wanted to leave, I gave in to allow them the opportunity to rectify the broadband issues as well as the atrocious customer service. I was once again assured they would call back the next day, before 9pm, to run more tests and see if they could fix my Wi-Fi. Well what do you know, I have received nothing. I have genuinely been in tears through stress and frustration at the treatment I have received and am shocked beyond belief this has happened AGAIN. I have never edured such stress with any company of any kind, as I have with BT. So if you'd like a reliable broadband and a good customer service base to take any problems to, do not use BT."
Samantha,BRECON,11/7/17,"well where do i start?! firstly i did not even get my BT TV and internet. had to cancel after 1 week of ordering,
i had placed my order over the phone with a lovely man, and unfortunately thats where all my problems started. he had told me my order went through fine, i then called on the saturday to see when it gets delivered, to my shock i found out that the TV never went through (i would never of known if i didnt go on the live chat), this woman then rang me very rude, telling me if i want tv i have to wait for an extra week, she then said she will call back sunday at 6pm after i finish work, she then rushed me off the phone not letting me talk and HUNG UP ON ME.. well it got to sunday 730 still no call so i contacted them again. he said she had not bothered even noting the account for them to call me, he then assured me someone will call me 6pm monday. well here we are now tuesday at 630pm still not had a call so i contact again for the 3rd time. this time i got passed from person to person, none of which actually helped me they just kept saying 'i'll pass you on to so and so and they can help'. well it then took them 50 mins to actually type a message to me. and what he came back with is 'can someone just call you tomorrow about this'. the result ended in me and him arguing over the chat as he would not allow me to cancel my order he said 'ill just call you in the morning and you can speak to someone then'. i was extremely angry then after getting passed to so many different people they were getting ruder as they passed me to each person. it took me nearly 3 hours to cancel my bt. cant imagine the problems i would of had if i didnt contact them that initial day. worst customer service i have ever known, all members of staff was rude to me. would not recommend to my worst enemy. shams of a company. i would recommend people to leave the company rather than join it.!"
John Dunk,Rhodes Minnis,11/7/17,While my connection is fairly reliable the speed is very poor - usually between 1 an 2 mbps. this makes it impossible for me to upgrade things like my TV or anything else that relies on good broadband speed. Even 5 mbps would help!
supersnaz,london,11/7/17,"4 weeks ago I decided to leave Talktalk after 3 years of appalling service, poor internet speeds, consistent incorrect billing and downright negligence with my account management. So, thinking that BRITISH TELECOMS, being the pioneer in BRITAIN for all things TELECOM's, would be the solution I took a plan with them.

I was due to have my broadband connected by midnight 6/10th. On a weekly basis I would contact BT to ensure that everything was in place in order to have my broadband activated, but guess what - I wake up on the 7th AND NO INTERNET.

After contacting BT I was spoken to by a rather terse and interruptive operative called Kira (Reading the other reviews it seems that if you have attitude you have a guaranteed job at BT). Kira, couldn't give me a time for when the engineers ""should have"" done this work on 6/10, Kira also couldn't ""guarantee"" that I would have internet on the 7th. After asking why I was not contacted with regards to the delay I received a ""we were not aware of the issue"" - how is that the case if the engineer has already attended.

So, in conclusion. I have no internet, am losing money thanks to not being able to get online, had an earful of attitude for asking for a guarantee that I would have internet by 7/10 AND am PAYING FOR THIS?!"
Joe,Greater manchester,11/5/17,"I'm going to start with the positive of we had a great member of the BT team who helped us in every way he possibly could and I cannot take that away from him but however his fellow employees are absolutely disgraceful extremely rude and refused to give their name for complaint.
The wifi is absolutely appalling !!! I thought this was the 21st century ! Fees like the 90’s with the dial up internet ! I've never experienced a wifi as terrible as this one. Apparently he router/hub has won awards for its speed well I can tell you it's a shambles ! It struggles to load the smallest of apps! When I try to use BT sports the wifi cuts out completely and the channel won't work due to the poor excuse of wifi. Struggle to stream on the BT sports app , incredibly disappointing ! Left sky because of how shocking they were ! Seems they are al the same !!!"
B Gardner,Coventry,11/3/17,"Since BT bought the previous ISP provider the cost has increased with no improvement in speed, 1.7MB."
Hombakazi Mxotyeni,London,11/3/17,"BT is a complete nightmare, ordered fibre broadband from them, they failed to connect it, they kept on changing dates for over 6 weeks , had to take my business else where and then I get a bill for £129.99, what exactly is this bill for BT as I had no broadband from you! Complete scam! I will never recommend this company, I've been on the phone with BT longer than any other company I have dealt with before, completely incompetent!"
Infowarrior,North wesr,10/31/17,
Regan,London,10/31/17,
Ian B,Salford,10/30/17,"Terrible!! Had a 12 month contract, great deal, price at £31.50 including sport, tv, line and broadband. Been with them x3 years. Then this year the problems started, messed up my bill, phoned customer services, said it was a computer glitch. This kept happening month after month, then last month I phoned them and was this time informed that the bill had increased and I hadnt replied to an email stating that I wanted to leave mid contract under these conditions.
I searched my email, spam, history, junk mail. And no record of any email.
This is a scam by bt, I've searched the internet and found many people with the same problems.. how can they be allowed to change a contract mid way through.. fortunately I'm not long away from the end. Good riddance, beware, the greed has kicked in just like Sky."
Medina,High Wycombe,10/27/17,
Andyw,Cornwall,10/26/17,Just finished 4 phone call to Bt - they claim broadband is working okay but I'm having to use 4g to post this
Miss Makombe,Birmingham,10/26/17,"The worst company to deal with they have no customer service skills especially their "" India team"" and complaints department who call to discuss your complaint but do not wish to listen to what you have to say spoke to a gentleman called Mike on the 26th 0f October who was worse than the other rude people I had spoken too and he claimed to be from the complaints department. It's a shame I have only just renewed my contract I have to put up with this for another year. Cash permitting I will pay it off early and get someone else to provide services."
susan english,milton keynes,10/26/17,"Ordered broadband on the 15.09.17 clearly stated £120 BT Reward Card but now they are saying there was no offer on the 15th and the offer started on 19.09.17 so for the sake of 4 days they are happy to loose a customer. Absoulte disgrace as it clearly stated the reward card which is why I went for the higher broadband package. Well done BT you've lost a customer, not before dragging out the complaint so I'm out of my cancellation period and want to charge me £600 for leaving. Yeah ok then. The broadband isn't constant and trying to watch anything on demand through their box is impossible as just stops connecting. STAY AWAY!!!"
James,Skipton,10/25/17,"Customer service is beyond awful (it wouldn't let me give zero stars). The line developed a fault which mysteriously resolved itself a day, and despite me getting text confirmation that it had been cancelled, they still sent the engineer out anyway. On cancelling my contract for TV, I had to write a letter to complain after they flatly refused to take my complaint about contract termination charges by telephone. Refused to allow me to give advance notice (more than a month) notice to terminate my contract. I was lied to and deliberately (I feel) misled as to my rights under the ""Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts"" Regulations. An eerily similar, awful experience when trying to cancel broadband a few months later. It really is hard to put in words how awful they are to deal with on any level, but woe betide you if you want to leave them someday..."
Pj,Bucks,10/24/17,"Bt infinity does that stand for infinately dropping out, poor speed and broken hubs? Had nothing but problems with infinity and for £50 a month a wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy. Over the year ive had the awful service I have had four supposedly new hubs. Been on the phone to India for dozens of very hard to understand hours. Had service men galore and still its poop. They come, look at the new hub, test the speed and go away happy with the 36mb ish speed. That lasts for a few days then we are back into dropouts and speeds of less than 10mb sometimes even as low as 0.4mb. Nothing is ever done and the compensation ive recieved in all this time us £11. And that is even taking into account haf total no service for eighteen days. Bt is a joke. One star is too much tbh but no option for minus stars."
Pankaj,ig89,10/23/17,"BLOODY TERRIBLE (BT), TEST YOUR LINE FOR STABILITY AND MADE UP YOUR MIND WITHIN THE CANCELLATION PERIOD (IF THEY HAVE ANY). If you have a problematic line then you will know many case handlers by name and guys from cancellation department as you will spend quite some time with them. Your first priority would be pick their calls even if you are in a meeting. You will end giving up any hopes of cancellations or line getting rectified."
Tink,Heelands,10/22/17,Excellent download speed on average of 45.5Mb. Upload of 13.6Mb. Occasionally wavers but on the whole a good service. Its worth paying for a better service if you want faster speeds.
Unicorn,Never Never Land,10/20/17,"If I could give NO STARS... I would have done.
At one time BT should for British Telecom
Today though... BT stands for BLOODY TERRIBLE

AND don’t even start me on Openreach....
Struth... this company couldn’t organise a phone network to save their lives...
BOTH Companies needs to be TERMINATED and NEVER allowed to be involved with telecommunications EVER AGAIN.....
They clearly have no idea how to run a Company.... never mind a Network... Their Engineers are about as much use a a Chocolate Fireguard....
What BOTH companies are very good at... is BLAMING THE OTHER COMPANY....
They clearly NEVER look at or act upon ANY of their Customers REVIEWS...
1Star for EVERTHING from almost EVERY CUSTOMER...99.9% of folks think you are CRAP....

WHEN IS OFCOM GOING TO STEP IN AND REMOVE THEIR LICENSE?

They are a SHAMBOLIC EMBARRASSMENT TO BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS....

PLEASE NOTE:
MY REVIEW IS NOT 1 STAR - IT IS “ZERO STARS” on ALL COUNTS"
Aaron,London,10/20/17,
Louise Johnson,Coventry,10/18/17,"Worst mistake I made moving over to BT. Broadband works when it wants too. Had numerous problems with it, in fact I never use the wifi on my phone. Now my tv box is not working, BT never fail to let me down!"
Simon,Petworth,10/18/17,"BT are appalling, there is no way they'd be in business still if they didn't have a virtual monopoly. If you can use anyone else, do."
Pete,London,10/17/17,"Utterly amazed at how badly we've been treated by BT. We signed up for their broadband service in mid September and were told that the engineers would be round to connect our flat on the 11th of October. We thought that was a bit of a wait, but accepted it and waited. On the day, no one came. Annoyed that two of our flatmates took the day off to make sure someone was at home we phoned and found a system error meant we had been missed. We were given an emergency appointment for the 13th.
Guess what? No one turned up. Furious, as again one of us took a day off to wait for the engineers, we called and BT claims the same error occurred for them again. Right...
Appointment made for today (17th). One of our flatmates again takes the day off, her birthday, and BT still don't come.
Three times in a row is actually not just unacceptable, but extremely rude. I can't quite believe BT and their customer response is next to useless and awfully organised. We have been offered no compensation and not even an apology. This has been a really upsetting experience and as a result I will avoid BT from now on.
Horrible company."
ali,suddon,10/15/17,"I have been with Bt for a long time and their service sucks big time, i am supposed to be getting 7mbps download but i only get just over 2mbps, hundreds of calls to India has solved nothing over the last 6 years, i will be changing provider very soon, do not go with Bt if you don't want hassles like i have, Bt are the worst provider going in my opinion, stay well clear."
Alexandra,Cornwall,10/14/17,"Diabolical treatment of customers. Heed my warning DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH BT. EVER. YOU WILL REGRET IT.
we moved out of our house 2 months ago I phoned BT spoke to (Sol) to ask them to cut off the phone the day we moved out, but when I realised it could be any time before midnight on that date hand to change it to the day before 2nd phone call. We have a period between moving out and we are not yet in our new house, BT (Kieron) advised me to put thing on hold as I would get a better deal as a current customer (FIRST LIE). Staying with relatives got an email as usual to ""see my latest bill"" I phoned to ask what was going on, spoke to 3 different people (Evette, Juliet, and David) who agreed I should not have a bill. And in fact THEY OWED ME £81.91 as I had been overcharged, for several months, I already knew that as my bill had gone up over several months from £42.59 to £65.98 but I couldn't face the trials of contacting BT. 45 minute phone call with David who said he would send me several emails with all the amounts I was owed which added up to £81.91 but he couldn't send immediately while I was on the phone because his ""computer was frozen""! Ok 2 hours later surprise surprise no emails and no money back!
I'm moving and dealing with solicitors, estate agents and surveyors so didn't have time or energy to phone BT again for another week, till I spoke to Rose who agreed BT owes me £81.91 but I CANT HAVE IT BACK AS A REFUND BECAUSE THEY DONT GIVE REFUNDS! The maximum she said she could send was£16.95 but the rest had to remain in my account ""in credit for when they start to bill me at my new house when I move in"". Couldn't argue any more so left it at that. 2 weeks later another email to see latest bill online. For £42.56FOR WHAT!? Phoned them again spoke to Aditya, John, and Rob (in Newcastle) they all told me I hadn't cancelled my account, it was still running and they were providing a service. WHERE FOR? I DONT OWN A HOUSE!! my number does don't exist any more! Rob was very rude and said my case is being escalated to a different department and ""someone""will phone me in a few days and nothing to do with him any more. It's been ""passed on"".
2 days later I got a text message saying they had tried to call me but ""had not get a response"". I had my phone in my hand at the time and it did not ring. 2 days later they did the same thing but as I answered they hung up on me. I have written a 3 page letter to their complaints department in Durham.
Please read about how BT treated me, scroll down and read how they treat 1,000's of their customers. But before you choose anyone else read their reviews as well, THEYRE ALL THE SAME!!! I was going to switch to Plusnet and their reviews are just as bad. There are not many choices in rural parts of the country so you are stuck. I am still fighting them and the ombudsman will take up my case next week as it will have been 8 weeks by then with no resolution. If you are trying to fight BT or ANY of them please contact the ombudsman they will fight your corner for you.
I can't leave no stars for customer service so have just left the lowest possible. Broadband speed and reliability ... I haven't got a phone line or broadband OR A HOUSE TO CONNECT IT TO SO that should be no stars as well!

I am fed up with giving hours of my life over on the phone to BT."
Stefania Alexandra,London,10/11/17,"BT IS THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!! THEY MADE US WAIT FOR ALMOST 3 MONTHS FOR INTERNET!!!!!!THEY ARE MAKING JOKES ON THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!! THEY JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND NOTHING ELSE!!!
Me and my partner called in August at BT to install broadband in our home. The order we made was through telephone and the guy from BT said the order is done, we have to wait 3 weeks to get our hub and everything. When the day came, we didn't received anything. We called BT again only to be told there is no order in their system and we have to wait one month more. I am a student and I need internet everyday and my boyfriend is doing his work through internet so you see how frustrating that is. The people they hire for customer service are not capable to think, they are robots, they just repeat the same phrase again and again. They don't even speak english!!!!!!!! So here we are, after 2 months of waiting for BT broadband, after spending hundreds and hundreds pounds for internet cafes, phone data etc the hub finally arrived. When we finally thought we are going to have internet at home..it is not working again. We call them to see what is the problem and they tell us to wait a few more days because we don't have a phoneline in the house?????? They couldn't even check in their system this major thing???? After the engineer came and solve the problem, we called them again and again only to be told...in final stage that the hub is not working properly and we have to wait 1 more week to receive another one... THIS COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY!!! IS THIS LONDON????? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO WAIT FOR 2 MONTHS AND 2 WEEKS FOR INTERNET????
TRUST ME, DON'T YOU EVER BUY ANY SERVICE FROM THIS DISGUSTING COMPANY!!!!!!!!"
Aurora,Manchester,10/11/17,"This company is such a flaming pile of rubbish that I do not even know where to start. We ordered our broadband 5/9/2017 and today a month later nothing has happened. An engineer came by to set up our phone line which doesn't work and has at no point worked. He told us they would be back to set up the broadband and never contacted us again. We have spent over £50 on phone calls trying to reach BT's impenetrable ""customer service"" 3 times a week for the past month trying to chase down our order to see if any developments are taking place. We have been redirected countless times and told that we would receive a phone call from their offline specialist team over and over again (countless times). We have received one phone call from the offline teams which came two weeks after we initially noticed that something is not right. The offline team couldn't help us at all and made us wait over 7 business days for their follow up phone call only to be told that ""our phone line is already working"" and that they cannot find our address on their database to organize the broadband over. There seems to be no consistency in their company-wide customer service as every time we called confused wondering where our broadband is, no one had any idea what was going on with our case, forcing us, the customer, to explain our situation to countless customer service agents over and over again. This company had the audacity to shamelessly take 7 business days ""to get back to us"" every time we called to make an inquiry on our order, and insisted time after time that our totally functionless and mute phone line is working, even after we BOUGHT A PHONE specifically for testing our phone line. This company COULD'VE been honest with us from the beginning and told us they cannot deliver us services as our address doesnt exist in their database. BUT NO. This company COULD HAVE some sort of basic ""high priority"" policy for customers that have had their unresolved case dragged out for weeks in order to speed up the process. BUT NO. This company COULD add details of progression in their customer service systems so that when we call, our server could easily check the developments of our order on their on systems. However, this utterly disfunctional and unacceptably disrespectful scam that BT calls a ""company"" has failed to do any of the above, or anything else for that matter to assist us. Even on our final phone call to them which cost us £8, the customer service agent had nothing else to say besides ""why didn't you use a phone box to call us to avoid spending so much money?"" We have finally cancelled our order and are absolutely mortified over being totally scammed and had our time and money wasted for an entire month. Now we are eagerly awaiting our refund which will hopefully arrive in ""5-10 business days""....."
Sharon,Manchster,10/11/17,"Please avoid this vile company like the playground.criminals in suits comes to mind. My bill doubled over the last two years,when confronted they came back with a cock and bull story.The TV package broke after a few month I never used it,never use the landline,and the broadband was average.you just get put through to a call center and my god can those people lie.shame on you BT for misleading the public and robbing them of their hard earned cash.Total disgrace the of you."
Natasha,Colchester,10/10/17,"DO NOT GO WITH BT!!
We set up BT and the extras that came with our package (bt sport and BT player) didn't work! When trying to contact them we were made to wait 3 hours and after demanding to speak to a manager we were told someone would contact us back. No one called us back and after attempting to call them back a further two times we remain unable to get through to the manager and the problem still remains.
WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT GO WITH BT!!!"
Phil,Littleborough,10/9/17,good speed when it works. wifi frequently drops connection. tv box (connected via ethernet) also losses connection. wifi signal poor even in next room (despite saying it's the uk's most powerful router?!) customer service is truly appalling
john doe,Northern Ireland,10/7/17,"This internet connection is payed for. Why doesn't it work reliably? An advertised 2mb/s connection repeatedly cuts to nothing! Unacceptable! I can understand that it ight slow during high traffic but his is 4 am in th morning, the infrastructure doesn't dissapear overnight and there is no excuse for denial of service. I am actually having to use my mobile to submit this because your pathetice internet has entirely cut out while my lan amd modem are still fully functioning. wtf"
Derek Diamond,Bristol,10/6/17,"BT are saying that they won't honour their £50 cashback as there is something on my browser that ensures it goes through EasyFundraising.

EasyFundraising is a free service that allows charities and good causes to raise money when their supporters shop online. Businesses such as BT sign up to donate a percentage of the sale to charity. I donate my percentage to the MNDA as my aunt died of Motor Neurones Disease last year.

It seems really underhand that BT would try to use this loophole to prevent paying out to customers an agreed amount of cash back. I clicked on the link on the MSE Newsletter dated 15 Mar 2017."
Sergio,Manchester,10/6/17,"Recently, I chatted with BT to ask some information regarding their services. Every time I tried, they refused to provide those information and they tried to push me to subscribe a contract despite I did not want to. I explained I was just looking for some information as I was going to move to a new home 2 months later but, eventually, they convinced me to subscribe a contract stating prices will increase and promising me I will not pay any money until the activation date.

Further to that, I tried to postpone my activation date but, despite this changed on their website, I did not receive a confirmation and I decided to contact them. They assured me the activation was postponed but, when I messaged them on Facebook, they told me it was not.

Also, I discovered they issued a bill and started debiting before the service was activated. I chatted with them but they refused to deal with my complaint and transferred my call to people who transferred my call to other people and so on. Every time, they just told me: ""Please, ignore the bill"". Of course, as I did not want to pay for something that has never been activated, I asked them to cancel my order, close the account and cancel the bill. They cancelled the order but my account is still open and there is a message stating I will receive my first bill.

Despite I have chatted and phoned them many times explaining this situation, they refused to deal with it. They told me my account is closed when it is open and I can access to it. They told me I will not receive any bill when there is a bill in there with my financial details. They refused to put this in write so I formally complained without receiving any reply.

Their customer service is shocking and they provide different answers every time. They do not accept or deal with complaints. They charge people for service never activated. I do not understand how they can still be able to trade."
Melissa,Wales,10/4/17,"I've never written a bad review before, but honestly this whole saga has caused us so much grief I had to. BT have been the most incompetent company I have ever had the displeasure to deal with.

We called up when moving house to upgrade to high speed fiber and set up the new address, we were told there was an available line and calling in advance we would be ready for moving in day.

This date came, nobody arrived and upon calling we were told the line was unfortunately in use, informing us they can't kick off the non existent other person so we have to pay to install another line and had to wait for an engineer. They told us the date we were supposed to be set up and even received a confirmation text that our engineer was arriving.
Seeing a BT van on the road with a man looking confused I went outside and spoke to him. The engineer was only there to install a line outside, I spoke to this man who was confused with conflicting information and after several calls it turns out we hadn't been informed our account was on hold, despite confirmation that day and they had the wrong property details due to the initial person who set us up writing our details incorrectly. Since the engineer was here he checked and the line which was apparently in use was perfectly fine and only needed to be turned on. He also informed me that if someone had left the line open they can infect kick them off, he had no idea why I was told that and he didn't understand why BT hasn't just turned our line on.

When calling up to sort this issue we were told we had to wait a further two weeks so they could send out an engineer to turn the line on. Two weeks past, nobody arrived.

We called up to sort out the issue, we were promised a months free broadband for our troubles and told they didn't even have an order for another engineer, and would have to wait until tomorrow so they could find out what was wrong.

We called back tomorrow to sort out the issue, they told us they never give compensation and cannot authorise a months free broadband. They told us we could intact get an expidited engineer as we have been waiting so long.

Nobody came, we rang up, they informed us the order for an expidited engineer was rejected, despite recieving confirmation. They put in another request and we had to wait a few days again.

Of course this was then rejected again, we were informed expidited engineers only get out through if the delay is their fault. Which it was. The customer service representative apologised but said the earliest we could get set up was the 7th of October. We put our application in on the 18th of august. We respectfully asked if we could cancel our order and moved to a different service provider, plusnet.

We receive a bill for £500 early cancellation fee of the broad and
I we never got to use. We call up and they agree it must be an error, which is still to be rectified as we are still recieving bills.


Our plusnet was supposed to be turned on today. We call up, and it turns out BT have disconnected our line! You've cost myself and my partner a fortune in mobile data & stress. Thanks BT. BRILLIANT SERVICE."
jay,Leicestershire,10/4/17,the singularly most unashamedly useless company i have had the displeasure of being a customer of largely because no one else would provide broadband in my rural patch. their customer services is diabolical and at one stage they left us for 7 days with no telephone line or broadband and then hiked the tariff. i am finally rid of them but the new provider was left stranded as they could not access the exchange open reach cabinet. cant even say it was a good riddance!!
Elliot,London,10/4/17,"Had a terrible time with BT and have been a loyal customer for years.

They offer such enticing deals to new customers ""cash back cards!"" ""free installation!"" but when you end up out of contract and paying £40.99 for 12MB broadband and they offer you a subpar deal compared to new customers I thought it was time to leave. I made arrangements for NOW TV to take over the line and everything looked like it was working fine until I was informed by NOW TV that BT had cancelled the order mid process because I had asked them to...?!

Was then without broadband for 4 weeks and spent over 4 hours on the phone to BT to try get it fixed. 3 engineer visits later (first they sent a telephone engineer to fix a broadband fault, then they cancelled the engineer at 5.45pm when i was told to wait from between 1-6pm for the visit and finally on the third visit after 3 days off work and another 2 hours on the phone, they got it working again. FANTASTIC my 12MB overpriced broadband is up and running again.

So...

About 10 different BT representatives some of whom PROMISE to call back on XX day and never do or text saying will call in a few minutes AND NEVER DO.

Over four hours on the phone to BT via India, Cardiff, Newcastle you name the location... I've been on hold there. Being forced to listen to their infuriating on hold music.

3 engineer visits to fix the problem and THEY STILL cant tell me what the issue was. All the time they are direct debiting my account for more money.

The compensation?

£60...
£10 for each missed engineer £20 for not having broadband for a month and £20 as a ""goodwill gesture""?!

Id love to leave them but Im scared they will pull the plug and leave me without broadband again.

BT ARE TERRIBLE PLEASE AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
Sheila,Burnley,10/4/17,"Would not pay BT customer service with washers they have NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL. We have been with them 15 weeks, without mobile service for 2 weeks as they cut my husband off for no reason, forgot to port our landline number from previous provider, we had 2 different temporary number am took 1 monTh to sort it out, not had a correct bill for 3 months STILL TRYING TO SORT IT OUT"
Mark,Newcastle upon Tyne,10/3/17,"Please listen to the reviews on here and do not make the mistake of signing up for BT broadband - it is truly terrible.

Moved over from TalkTalk, thought it couldn't get any worse, turns out it does.

The expected speed for fibre optic broadband in our area is approx 33mb/s. I have just performed a test and currently have a whopping 0.29mb/s. I understand speeds can vary but this is at 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon..

When contacted BT all they can offer is an engineer to come and assess the line at a cost of £130 because their 'tests' show its a problem with the part of the line I'm responsible for...convenient. I was getting speeds of 15mb/s with TalkTalk only last month so have difficulty believing their opinion.

The customer service is terrible and the speeds are worse.

Avoid."
MUHAMMAD,PUDSEY,10/2/17,"This rubbish and worst company even not deserve one star. I have applied broadband at dated June 03, 2017. Even after passing 50 days, i did not get internet and at dated July 25, I have requested to cancel due to no longer required. I explained the reason to one, then he transfers to next then transfer to next. same reason I explain to everyone and line dropped. then called back and again explained to 2-3 staff members then again line dropped. no one called me back. then I traveled outside country and I received bill coz the line was not being canceled. so far today as of oct 2, 2017, after passing 4month, I have called more than 15 times, spent more than 3 hours in call holding/talking and up to today I am not able to get rid of this rubbish. one says the service is being canceled, the other says not canceled.
is there any senior staff of this company looking this review or we just wasting time to write this review."
Joerg Bauerle,Sunbury,10/2/17,"Bad Connection. Rude customer service.
Never again."
ayse,,10/1/17,
B,Ripon,10/1/17,"No internet for a month. Bt keep changing the date to repair. Not interested in their customers at all.
Customer service what service.
Come on get your act together and listen to your customers and start acting on delivering."
Mark Michael,London,9/30/17,"Premium prices for average service!
I'm writing this review in regards to my parents, my first complaint goes back a few months, where they were sold a ridiculous package by a pushy salesperson, My parents are in there mid 70s and don't really use the internet that much, but they were still recommended a premium product which made there total monthly payment around £60-£70 per month. I was absolutely livid when I found out that these companies push there product on pensioners who don't really know better, and to be honest the internet connection was not that great.
Recently I spent a few days trying to sort this out, my parents are from an age where loyalty is rewarded, and have been with BT for 45 years. After numerous calls and being put on hold BT finally offered a £5 discount per month...
I'm not sure what planet BT is on but I have now changed them to another provider who delivers a better internet service but the bills are coming in at around £22 per month, a massive difference.
I can't recommend BT, and find them to be just a bunch of cowboys living off a past reputation..."
John Beshir,Dorchester,9/29/17,"Ordered on the basis of a cheap offer in June. Had nothing but headaches since then. Pay £100, £200 more a year if you have to, to work with someone else.

Customer support lack basic record keeping, access to solve problems, ability to understand things or escalate, BT will do things and then customer service staff won't be able to tell you who did them and why, and they will point blank tell you they cannot solve your problem.

Your order can fail silently on the day of installation, get closed, and then you can have BT bill you for early termination, and leave you having to contact them to get them to fix this. And when you phone up they just say they can refund your bank and place a new order, they can't fix the earlier one, with weeks more delay.

Go with someone who can actually do their job."
Randal,London,9/28/17,"BT's offering is way below par! The connection is ridiculously slow and other times, we cannot connect at all. Complained to Customer Services and they were of very little help. In fact, they were rude and obnoxious. They need to all be sent on some form of training course in effective customer service. Simply awful! Will never go back to BT for as long as I shall live."
Nick Horley,Epsom,9/28/17,"I have left sky to come across to Bt fibre - big mistake.
Your engineer installed equipment on Friday 22nd Sept but could not activate as the routing given to the exchange was full. Therefore left me with no broadband as Bt had told Sky to disconnect. Various phone calls to Bt mainly result in being put on hold for up to an hour . Told nothing could be done until Monday. I then had to chase on Monday to see what's happening!! . Told job had to be cancelled and new job issued . Told to phone back Tuesday. 2 calls later on Tuesday told engineer needs to come out on Wednesday. This is complete opposite to what engineer said needs to happen . Chased engineer up on Wednesday as no one turned up . Told he was the same engineer and they had given him same routing as before so not coming out and said BT are useless as it happens all the time . I then have to spend another hour on phone to BT who blame open reach and say we will update you on Thursday.
I have been without broadband for 6 days now and surprisingly no call from BT today . I don't know what's worse the fact that BT don't seem to care and fob you off or that they don't actually know what they're doing . To add insult I did receive an email to say my first bill will be sent out on the 8th October!!!!"
Andy,United Kingdom,9/27/17,"Much like the many reviews on here - Abysmal service.

The broadband has stopped working at my house. I've spoken to BT 12 times in the last week and they still haven't been able to resolve my issue.

Been told the Hub is broke and I should buy a new one. (Their words! they wouldn't send me a new one due to contract issues even though been a customer for over 10 years). The new one I bought didn't work. Rung them again. Was told it has nothing to do with the hub and it's an issue in the household. Will send an engineer on Tuesday. I booked a day off work. The next day I was told it was not internal but an external issue. They sent the engineer and Proclaimed it was fixed. It clearly wasn't. Rang again. On hold for 45 minutes. Cut off. Rang again. Was promised a call back. No call back. Rang again. They told me it should be working. No. Rang again. Cut off. Rang again. Told me it was an internal issue! Said they couldn't send an engineer out til next week.......I give up.

Would be quicker to train as an engineer and fix it myself."
Nicky Williams,Wales,9/27/17,"I was hoping that by leaving a bad review BT might sit up and listen - but with so many terrible reviews they can't care at all. I've just spent ages on the phone again trying to get fibre optic installed in our home - and I could hear loads of other similar calls going on in the background. It actually made me feel sorry for their call teams. It must be soul destroying to work for such a poor customer service company. I ordered fibre optic in the beginning of July. The lady on the phone said it would be installed two weeks later and gave me a date and time - I stressed that I would have to take time off of work and get staff in, so would be costly to me. So I wanted to know someone would definitely turn up (having been let down so many times before by BT on our business line). Naturally nobody arrived - no phone call - only the equipment was delivered as promised. Numerous phone calls and ten weeks later I've just called them again. Two weeks after the promised return phone call from them that never happened. This time I have been told that there is a fault with two packages being on the account (one the old copper and one the new fibre) - but I should be pleased because I am only paying for one even though the fibre hasn't been installed. And this had stopped progression of the order?? What is a girl to do? All I want is to upgrade from copper to fibre, as all their adverts suggest. Our copper is well below the acceptable download/upload rates and frankly not worth a penny. But apparently that is our fault for living in a rural area. So, the outcome - a complaint has been raised (AGAIN), and the issue has been escalated (AGAIN). It is in their hands and they will be in touch within five working days apparently. Not holding my breath that a) we will get a call or b) it will be a call worth taking and anything has actually happened. If you can avoid using BT then I would strongly recommend you do!"
Paul Roberts,Cumbria,9/27/17,"The following is an email sent to the ombudsman regarding BT.
For over a year I have noticed that the downloading of files is very slow in the late afternoon using BT infinity service. The reason for this became clear when I purchased a Samsung 4K HDR TV on 25/11/16 which requires a minimum of 25kbps to play a Netflix 4K HDR program, the Netflix app is also able to measure the kbps supplied via BT. When using both Netflix and BT’s own wholesale speed tests I discovered that between 5pm and midnight every day the speed slowly goes down to as low as 2mbps, the lowest normally between 9pm and 10pm. The contract I signed up to with BT stated I would receive a minimum of 34mbps minus 1 to 2mbps in peak periods. Contacting BT on their help line proved to be a long and frustrating process as I was told to contact them when the fault was present and then they can do a line test. Contacting them between 9 and 10pm proved to be impossible as I could be on hold for as long as 45 minutes before being disconnected, this was the case from January to May 2017.
I also purchased the latest smart hub from BT but was left with same problem.+
Desperate for a solution I contacted the help line in the morning and requested them to contact me at 9pm, as I was unable to get through to them, which they did and a test was done which was 4kbps and they admitted there was obviously a fault.
To-date I have had four engineers visits each one clearing my property and equipment and saying that the fault is external i.e. is a BT supply or equipment issue. The situation now is even worse, there have been too many helpline telephone conversations to list but below is just a small example of recent events.
27/07/17-ENGINEER CLAIMED HE HAD FOUND A HOT CONNECTION IN THE EXCHANGE AND SOLVED THE FAULT. SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.
28/07/17- SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.
29/07/17- SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.
30/07/17- SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT, ALSO SERVICE IS NOW INTERMITTANT.
31/07/17- NO INTERNET CONNECTION. WHOLESALE ENGINEER MADE A SCHEDULED VISIT AND CLAIMED IT WAS A CABLE DAMAGE PROBLEM, LATER IN THE DAY HE SAID IT WAS BT EQUIPMENT IN DISTRIBUTION CABINET AT FAULT AND HE WAS NOT AUTHOURISED TO TOUCH THIS EQUIPMENT.
1/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE.
2/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE.
3/08/17- INTERMITTANT SERVICE UNTIL 6PM, AFTER 6PM SERVICE IS OK AND NIGHT TIME SPEEDS ARE 34MBPS.
4/08/17- VISIT FROM ENGINEER CHECKED MY EQUIPMENT, SAID OK AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MAJOR CABLE FAULT.
5/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE. HELPLINE HAD AUTOMATED MESSAGE SAYING FAULT WILL BE FIXED IN TWO HOURS - IT WAS NOT.
6/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE. HELPLINE HAD AUTOMATED MESSAGE SAYING FAULT REPAIRED RESET YOUR HUB - STILL NO SERVICE.
7/08/17- SERVICE CAME ONLINE AT AROUND 3PM, NETFLIX NOW SAYS CANNOT CONNECT ANY OF ITS THREE SERVERS. CONTACTED BT HELPLINE AS I HAD BEEN PROMISED A CALL FROM A CASE HANDLER, HELPLINE SAID I WILL DEFINITELY BE CONTACTED BEFORE 6PM BUT, AGAIN, DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL.
8/08/17- INTERMITTANT SERVICE.
9/08/17- A 7pm speed test with both Netflix and BT Wholesale gave speeds of 5 and 10mbps. Still not received the promised call from BT.
I would like to stress that the above is only a small fraction of the telephone conversations I have had with BT.
Each time I contact BT they try to convince me that this is an isolated fault but everyone I have spoken to in the Arnside area has been having exactly the same internet problems with BT infinity. I have also been offered a partial refund by a gentleman called Joseph which turned out to be a credit for a product that is not fit for purpose. As BT are unable or unwilling to deal with the poor internet performance I intend to change my internet supplier as I cannot spend any more time on this farcical situation, and think it is not unreasonable to receive a full refund for a service contract I signed up to but have never received.
Further information as requested.
18/08/2017- BT (Daniel) phoned at 20.00hrs and asked if the problem was solved. I informed him the evening fault was no more but now I am only receiving a constant 27mbps, not the minimum 34mbps as advertised. He also admitted as I had previously had daytime speeds of around 36mbps there was no reason they could not be achieved now. He then arranged an engineer’s visit for 21/08/2017. When the engineer arrived his instrument showed a speed of 29mbps but said he could not investigate further as BT had told him 24mbps was acceptable, I was shown and read this communication from BT. The same day I logged on to the BT website which stated if I signed another contract with them they calculated I would receive a minimum of 36mbps to 49mbps.
This is a good and typical example of BT. I have personally witnessed many test results at my property only to be told a completely different reading days later by BT.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your efforts on my behalf but I do not expect a result in my favour as I do not expect an accurate record of events from BT, this being my conclusion after months of dealing with this company."
Laci,Chester,9/26/17,"I joined BT because they had an Infinity fiber deal. Before the end of the contract I had to change my address and called BT to transfer my broadband to the new address. They told me that at the new address I can't get Infinity fiber, although fiber was available at the new address, they just had two same flat numbers on their website and mixed the address up. They attracted me into a Copper Broadband contract with slow speeds, promising that when fiber will be available I will be upgraded with no extra cost. Now they want me to pay extra if I want Infinity Fiber. Had a lot of phone calls and chats with their customer service but they failed to solve my problem. You talk to them and then nothing happens, the problem persists. Once they trap you in a contract you are just a good cash machine for them. Unreliable broadband and service. And the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Never again BT. This is my experience with them."
Liana,Northolt,9/23/17,"I am very disappointed with their service.
Joined them a month ago.They messed it up before we joined them and now not even a month after we have no internet at all,called them a few times and it is like I am talking to a robot,computer says no,and been advised that it will take 3 days to sort the fault.It is the second day today,no feedback at all. Such a crucial time with no internet as It has messed up my daughter's homeworks.
Besides all thiese problems I joined them as they had an offer to get a reward card,but now they refuse to give me my reward card."
Danny,Isle of Wight,9/22/17,I am speechless and so very angry about BT It must be the worse service inn every aspect I have ever had the missfortune to experience in my entire life !!!
chris,Nothumberland,9/21/17,"I could write pages of frustrating rants here, but I dont want to re-live it all. In short it took me over 18 months to finally get the billing and BB sorted to the original request. It has cost me a fortune in wasted time and extra billing costs.

Warning:
BT customer service is abysmal just want to fob you off and then deny what you have been told.
Impossible to tranfser your old number despite being told that can.
Refunds promised on purchase never materialised.
They put things on your bill without telling you e.g. BT sport. Then insist that I requested it and wont refund.
Were charging for an old BT email address (despite having several free with the package) as it was on an old server; and couldn't/wouldn't take it off the bill!
The hardware does not function to specification (infinity) and frequently drops out but am told to reset and there are no faults on the line.
Mix this with long delays waiting for customer service, poor assistance when you get someone - do yourself a favour and find another company!"
Disgruntled,England,9/20/17,Broadband deteriorated so called BT. After doing a speed test myself told it was my 'old hub' which wax out of warranty. Good news I was almost out of contract so could get a new deal with new hub 'probably cheaper than current contract. Great! Transferred to sales. My contract was actually had over another year to run and my hub was in warranty. Transferred back to faults who had misinformed me as they could send me a new hub free of charge. Great! They would only send next version. On complaining they agreed to send latest smart hub to arrive in a few days. Email confirmation tells me my order is heading for someone else's address?! I ring and have another 2 hours on phone. It's 'a system fault' apparently. They place another order to my address to arrive today. Email tells me it's on its way for delivery. It never arrived. I contact on line help get transferred from order management team to technical team and back to order management who then hang up. On my account are 3 orders for smart hubs but who has then I wonder cos let's face it it's not me. Do I contact BT tomorrow for another round of complaints and 2 hours of my life I won't get back. If this is a quality service for the £37 I pay each month then who are they kidding.
Steven,West Sussex,9/20/17,"Avoid BT, unfortunately, during a move of house I wanted a better wireless router and used the opportunity to move to BT. The Smart Hub 6 is the worst router I've used, I've had three of them and they reboot at least twice a day, not great when streaming my TV via the wifi. I got a Hub 4 and the reboots never occurred, but the signal was awful due to the very low spec of this.

The BT customer service experience was horrendous, clueless and all they ever wanted to do was run a line test, despite the fault clearly being with the router. Every call with them was at least 45 mins, same crap on every call.

Still trying to break out of my contract due to the poor service, will never use BT for any service again."
Carl M,Dewsbury,9/20/17,"Terrible customer service.

I was a happy Plusnet customer with no real issues, however, I was unfortunately tempted away by a BT sales representative who promised me the world, but in reality my experience has been very different.
Initially I had constant problems with the Home Hub 6 and its WiFi.
Every time I rang the technical department I was either given a solution that failed to solve the problem or more often than not I was cut off before completing my conversation, leaving me and my entire family frustrated and often without a WiFi service.

I was sent a replacement HH6 which did not resolve the issue and eventually I was sent a HH5 which did thankfully cure the problem and since then I have had no techical issues since,
However, the customer service and billing have continued to be well below standard.

My latest bill included a £65 charge supposedly for asking to leave the broadband service early, something I didn't ask for or was discussed with anyone at BT.

When I tried to resolve this by phone, I spoke to an advisor who initially tried to tell me the £65 charge wasn't actually a cancellation fee as stated but rather a charge for one of the routers? When I explained this wasn't the case as the only router that worked was the HH5, He put me on hold and never returned, leaving me hanging on the phone for 20 minutes + listening to ""On Hold"" music.
I then tried to ring back later only to be put in a queue with no answer, and when BT turned their phone lines off at 9pm I was cut off despite waiting 45 minutes for a reply.
I then attempted to contact BT via the online chat, eventually after a 30 minute wait I spoke to a lady call advisor who initially told me the £65 was credited back to my account in a payment of £75.95 to my account in July.
I explained that this was incorrect and the £75 95 credit was a refund promised to me for leaving my previous provider Plusnet early to cover their early cancellation fee. BT repaid me the charges made to me by Plusnet.
She then said I would receive a £65 refund to my account, She also insisted I should ""relax"" something that I feel wasn't appropriate at the time.
When I demanded that I wanted to escalate my complaint to a supervisor, She stalled for a while and eventually passed my complaint over to a supervisor.
He asked what could be done to resolve my complaint and I explained I wanted early cancellation of my contract with no cancellation fees as I felt the service isn't fit for purpose.
He told me he couldn't do this and would have to escalate this further and promised me a callback in 48 hours.
No callback was made to me, despite being promised and yet again I had to contact them via the online chat. I spoke to an advisor who told me I would receive a call tomorrow.
After explaining the promise made by the supervisor, I eventually received another call from another supervisor who explained he failed to callback as he was tied up with another complaint (A complaint that appears to have taken 48 hours)
Again, he claimed it wasn't something he couldn't deal with and I again have been promised yet another callback that could happen at anytime over the past week. (I have no confidence it will happen at all).
Had I have known what poor customer service BT had I would have never have left my previous ISP Plusnet.
I have no desire to remain a BT customer, as I feel I have been treated very badly.
Promises have been made that haven't been kept, money taken out of my account that shouldn't have been and I have had to constantly endure terrible customer service in an attempt to resolve the problems created by BT"
Colin Archer,Ipswich,9/20/17,"Unbelievably arrogant. I had TV, phone, broadband and mobile service with this bunch of cowboys. I had an issue with mobile service, they refused to compromise so I have now cancelled everything - they have achieved a short term gain, but will now lose me as a customer forever."
Beth Smith,Colchester,9/19/17,Wish there was a minus scale! terrible company the worst customer service I have ever had even from the managers. The managers hanged up on me and the BT staff of many occasions lied to me. Took 2 months for them to install my phone line I gave up in the end and got sky out and they installed within 1 week dont ever use them!!!
Simon Black,Godalming,9/19/17,"The worst customer service I have ever received! The audacity of calling my firm and then hanging up on me in the space of 3 seconds when I trying to assist!

Words do not describe fully my anger to BT Connect's employees! I will never take a call from them again. Suitability of their employees recruited seriously need to be reviewed. That or BT are the best show case of poor customer service culture."
Kate,Manchester,9/19/17,"Wish could give them 0! Terrible terrible service, lying to customers and it has been two months and they couldn't get phone line installed. What a joke!"
Lili Carr,Ealing,9/18/17,Literally the worst broadband I've ever experienced. Cuts out at 11pm EVERY NIGHT for anywhere between 30mins to 3 hours. Complaints and requests to resolve the issue have been met with the telephone equivalent of blank stares - despite the fact that BT are obviously resetting their system at this time every night. Truly terrible. Like being back in the early 2000s.
Sam,exter,9/18/17,"The worst product service ever, i will never use them again!"
RR,Swanage,9/18/17,"Can't wait to finish the contract, bad experience with customer service. The router is advertised as most powerful when it comes to signal but is the worst router I have ever had. Try to obtain the id and password to instal my own router but the customer service failed to help me. We live in a flat and the signal can't travel from living room to my bedroom or my kid bedroom and let me tell you is not a huge apartment. The router resets at least 3 times per day and that in the middle of the move, very frustrating.
All in one bad experience with bt fibre."
Susan,,9/17/17,Terrible service once again from BT! We were just waiting for our contract to finish in January because the fibre optic is so bad but we are moving. So we have to tie into another contract for 12 months on cable. It's a joke! Can't wait to leave!
Kevin,London,9/16/17,"Was a long-term customer of BT. A while ago I tried to move to an advertised Infinity package to be told that this was for new customers only and my package would be nearly twice advertised. So I recently decided to move. After ringing BT to confirm transfer date I was given the hard sell about offers BT could give me and it concluded with the person implying it was my fault I had been paying £££ as I hadn't been on the phone to them to negotiate, and that I had been lying about the previous conversation where I was penalised for being an existing customer.

BT used to be good but a bit pricey. Now their broadband is average, their technical support is patchy at best and, based on my last phone call, their customer service is truly awful.

BT are a bit better than the very worst broadband suppliers but nowhere near the better suppliers - the technical support which was better than others has become steadily worse as well. They still charge a premium and, based on my experience, treat their long-term customers with contempt. What has happened to this company?"
Joel,"Sprowstown, Norwich",9/16/17,
pauline,durham,9/15/17,if i could of put zero i would i have had problems with BT for a long time i will be reporting them to of com as they take no notice when you complain about the service you get but are happy to take your money. fuming
Richard Platts,"bratton, westbury, wiltshire",9/15/17,"If I could rate them any lower like -10 I would. For 3 months bt couldnt fix a problem with our internet, every single week we would have to go through an hour long process of registering the fault either by phone or live chat. Everytime they send an engineer they turn up whenever they decide without notification, fiddle with a few things n then say yep all good n not tell us what the problem is. It would work for 10hrs n then starting cutting in and out constantly. After 3 months they found a fault in line and switched us to another, since then (2 weeks) our speed has been pathetic 6 - 7 mbs down n 0.7 mbs up, this is when we pay for fibre optics upto 54mbs. All this hassle has nearly destroyed 2 businesses that need the internet my son has been trying to start and we also have spent hundreds of pounds replacing everything in the house incl phones, cables n a computer."
Chris Wright,Longburton,9/14/17,"Shocking service. Broadband infinity speeds of 1.5MB and has been as low as 450KB.
BT tell me that fault is due to my internal wiring or router fault.
Next door neighbour has same problem.
I would be better off on dial up."
stacey mills,South Wales,9/13/17,
Charlie,Falmouth,9/13/17,
Nirmal,Aldershot,9/12/17,"Had appointments of engineer 3 times but never turned up. When I phoned them, every time I was told there were errors. Shocking !!

Finally managed to cancel the service. I'm so glad I'm with them anymore. It is better not having broadband than their awful service."
tabby,,9/12/17,"absolutely appalling broadband. go against their own terms and conditions. Stay away from BT. Horrendous and rude customer service. Will not let you out of contract when they guarantee at least 1mb and then your internet completely drops to 300kps ? Then when you ring they try to say it has to be to a wired device , when you tell them yes my laptop is connected to the box like you ask and yet they still try to give some stupid excuse. forget doing anything important even at 1am in the morning when noone else is on the internet and it is still a appalling. Wish i had stayed with sky wasnt the fastest broadband but was a lot more reliable and customer service is 5 star compared to bt."
Tim,DERBY,9/12/17,Poor service and even worse internet speeds. Regret changing from Sky.
Tammy Mac,Dollar,9/12/17,"Waited 2 weeks for an 'engineer' to come and set up my internet and tv. Was told that it was all in place the day before he came. When he came he was rude and the internet was not working so he just told me the instructions would be with it all and I would have to do it myself as the line was not working. He failed to feed back to BT that there was a problem. After spending all day on the phone to Indian call centres and having to go through the details time and again, I was told I would have to wait over a week for anyone to come out. I cancelled it all and went to Sky. BT then charged me for ""providing broadband service"" which I never used as I had no broadband! They said I would have to pay it as I didn't give them chance to come and fix it which was because I couldn't wait potentially weeks for them to come back. Their customer services is dreadful. Unhelpful and rude."
Amanda,London,9/12/17,"Shocking, terrible service! Have called over 4 times to change my plan, then when I thought it was all sorted, they have billed me for my previous package i.e. they didn't change my package....so what the hell was I on the phone for hours for?? Also, I'm only allowed fibre optic which is expensive and unreliable. Live in a small one bedroom flat and the wifi doesn't work in the bedroom...."
Renaud,London,9/11/17,"The speed is just below average, low yet reliable, and therefore acceptable as long as you don't play video games.
But here is my problem.
I just moved address, to do so, BT forced me into a new 12-month contract and offered speed between 6 and 10mb.
I am now at the new address and the service is between 1 and 4mb, so under the speed mentioned, so since it is a new contract (forced by them) I have decided to enjoy the 14 days cancellation policy.
I was then explained I still had to pay £31 to disconnect the line and £55 for the router.
When Challenging these cost, saying I was only canceling because the service was not fulfilled anymore, I was tald it was fulfilled since the ""minimum speed guaranteed"" was only of 1MB.
This is a Joke, This is BRITISH TELECOM, our nationnal supplier of telecommunication, and they still find a way to rip people off and refuse to admit fault.
Rubbish"
Jack,"Perthshire, Scotland",9/10/17,"Had BT Infinity in my area for just about 2 years now, and there's only been a couple times (in last 2 years) where it went down and it was resolved by pulling the plug and starting fresh.

Constant 74 down and 18 up and ping of 20ms.

Customer service was pretty average, long-ish queues and simple advice.

The broadband is very good though, especially compared to our old 5mb dsl line."
martin,swindon,9/6/17,"BT Infinity fibre optic broadband - one word...poor.
Not a day goes by without the connection dropping out. Speed gets slower in the evening, connection drops and trying to watch programmes via BT TV is hit and miss to say the least.
My old standard broadband with Talk Talk was far more reliable!"
David,Highlands,9/6/17,"Congratulations to BT for chasing another loyal customer of of 25years away, I am looking forward to the day my contract come to an end so I can get rid of this poor poor company . After speaking to 9 different advisors and being giving different prices for there broadband and infinity package I give up . All we were doing was moving house you would think that would be straight forward, but not for bt.
Was told we would have to pay a cancellation fee, and take a new package.then we found out we were not in a contract so we would get a refund ,now we have told we would be getting a bill for £31. Then my wife would lose her email address , and after her being on the phone for an hour was told there was nothing they could do as it was already being cancelled , but suprise suprise, if she pays £5 per month she could keep her email address , rip of company ,end of my contract can't come fast enough.
Stay away from bt,for your own sanity.."
Phil,BIRMINGHAM,9/6/17,"BT are without a doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with. Some of their practises must be bordering on illegal. With so many tech companies out there you would be mad to deal with this company. If I could give a negative star rating, then it would be-10. They will never see another penny of my money or anyone connected to me. Vote with your wallet people."
Steven,Holmfirth,9/6/17,"I was lied to by 5 different people about my router being dispatched, I am now 10 days without any internet and still no router in sight. I cannot comment on speed or reliability of the actual service - I wish I could."
Sophie elise hopkins,Uk,9/5/17,I really pleased with bt there so helpful friendly and polite. Ive had so many issues with sky and i can honestly say i dont regret switching. Bt helped me so much with my small problem and helping me choose pakages
Sam,London,9/4/17,"Would give 0 stars, or better -5 stars if possible! Choose another provider, even if they happen to be more expensive - which hardly likely.
Will NEVER EVER go with BT again and would advise anyone to go with a different provider.
Theft in broad daylight; appalling customer service, untrained and unknowledgable staff, rude staff, outrageous pricing; getting customers to pay for 'disconnecting' even though that does not actually happen (had to wait 14 working days after my start date to get connected, because the engineer had 'forgotten to pull the switch to disconnect the previous resident at my address'."
Miakatt,Leeds,9/4/17,"Absolute rubbish. Gets to 7pm and slows down to something that makes dial-up look like optical fiber broadband.
Been like this for 5 months. Indian call center is annoying. Nothing gets done. Have had some good experiences with UK call staff, but the technical issues remain and can't be fixed.
Now moving the Virgin Media with fiber to the door service to ensure I don't end up stuck in another 12 month contract with sub-standard internet."
Stephen Falkner,Holyhead,9/3/17,"Been with BT for years. I got bt tv installed last year. BT used a 3rd party contractor & second tv with youview has suffered heavy pixellatio for most of the time. Difficult to contact & Indian call centre staff preoccupied with telling you there is a £130 attendance charge despite it being there fault. So far two attempts to rectify have failed & l have had a desultory refund of my second youview box rental charge for the last t months. Enough is enough. If it's not fixed soon l will be off back to Sky. They might cost more, but at least their tv service works & their engineers are properly trained."
Ben,Manchester,9/1/17,"Call outs with engineers that never show up as the BT rep didn't confirm it. Lines unstable, replacement router sent but nothing fixed. Never dealt with a more incompetent support team. Any issue has to be 'escalated' and takes days / weeks to get anything started."
kevin,Derry,8/31/17,"First of all let me say they are sneaks. about a year ago I asked if they could drop the bt sports package as I don't watch and they said no problem told me my bill will be XX less and I said okay. 5 weeks later they send a letter out saying I signed up to a 24 month contract and when I phoned they said it was too late as it was 5 weeks since i went to the contract (never got an email and they never mention 2 year contract) long story short they wanted me to pay £800 to cancel early. Was never going to happen.

Now I wish I could say it ended there but no sadly I am paying for a connection speed i don't get. BT say up to 52 mb connection as I am paying for fibre optics they might as well say up 10 mb least it be closer to what they offer. I am lucky to get 7mb connection at midnight when most people are off.

I have friends next door to maybe paying half the price for virgin media getting 50-100mb. They don't care they give BS excuses as they know I can't leave for another 9 months.

They have so many hidden charges that it's a joke my bill is supposed to be so much a month yet the fail to mention line rental and a number of hidden charges that end up nearly double the price of the package i signed up to.

Once this contract is over I am switching to virgin or sky. They don't care about there customers all they see is ££ signs. How can we rip our customers off today.

The only good thing i can say is the connection doesn't drop"
Alex,London,8/30/17,"By far the worst service I have ever experienced, not even going to bother explaining as every other review covers the exact same crap I went through, after my 12 months is up going to switch to virgin or another provider without hesitation."
jennifer stewart,Streatham,8/30/17,"BT is not want you think. I can think of three services that are excellent in comparison to BT.
BT customer service talk the good talk but do not deliver. There are unforeseen extra charges which bump up your budget so making it difficult each month. If you want to get out of a contract it will cost £260. The broadband will stop working for no apparent reason and the phone reception can be distorted with static. Most people I know are with other providers despite the fact that the broadband is 10% less faster. But why? Because the overall customer service is good. One or two good services does not equal customer satisfaction. Very disappointed, very shocked and will not ever go back to BT. Rubbish!"

Russell Chaplin,"East Boldre, Hampshire",8/30/17,"My line and Broadband is and has been useless for 15 years. The quality and bandwidth has continued to fall and is now regularly under 1 Mhz. I cannot use any of the products that go with the company advertising and cannot even use I-Player on the lowest quality and yet they are charging me for all these features.
This an incompetent and criminal company. There is no alternative for me since the crumbling copper infrastructure is owned by BT. All other ISP's suffer the same since they have to use the same junk. Actually the survey does not reflect my anger since there is no ZERO to be recorded."
John Hire,HS2 0ST,8/29/17,"I have lived on the Isle of Lewis for the past twenty years and it is only in the past few years that broadband suppliers have realised that there are people populating these Islands. Yes, it's a few years since we only had dial-up but we have a long way to go before we reach the same service more populated areas of ""Ha Ha"" great Britain."
Huw Day,"Cookstown, Northern Ireland",8/29/17,"Where to start...

The TL;DR:
- Customer service that does everything it can to dissuade you from logging an issue
- Misavertised product
- Poor to no connection
- Inability to fix recurring issues.

For those who want a more involved review:

When I signed up for BT Broadband, their website began by steering me towards their Infinity option (30 to 50mb at the time, I think). Then their scan told me I wasn't eligible. I ended up going with the standard broadband package, up to 17mb was the promised figure.
I later spoke with an engineer. He said there is no physical way I can ever get more than 3.

Less than two months after starting the contract I began to have connection issues. The speed would drop to less than half a mb, or would drop out altogether. Whenever I try to call, I am kept on hold for a minimum of 20 minutes, most often nearer an hour. In the first call, they tried to accuse me of badly wiring the phone lines in the house (i'd just moved in and I don't touch wiring) and said that if this was the case an engineer visit would cost £130.
A few words later, an engineer was booked without charge and he later found that the issue was due to a bad installation by the original installer prior to us moving in and due to the pole across the road being overrun with ivy and the box flooded. The engineer spent 2 hours cleaning the pole, fixing the issue.
Connection was fine (i.e. 2mb) for another few months, then started having similar issues. Phoned again, was left on hold again for ages, then they asked me to measure my broadband speed in about fifty different ways, all returning speeds between 0.5 and 0.7mb. They put me on hold for another ten minutes, then came back saying there was no problems on their end, but could I do another speed test. Suddenly, 2.3mb. Draw your own conclusions there.
I am now suffering these issues again, and to top it off they upped my bill three months ago (£33.99 to £41.99) without notifying me. Their excuse... ""You would have received an email"".
So... bad to unusable connection, poor customer service, a general inability to fix recurring problems and dodgy billing practices.

I am currently making arrangements to switch to Zen. If you like a stable connection and good customer service, then talk to a horse before trying BT."
anthony o'meara,lincoln birchwood,8/29/17,bt lie about speeds i get...i get kbps...very slow hate it
Dave Alvis,Leeds,8/28/17,Fibre speed found to be way below what they advertise. Keeps dropping connection. Expensive when at end of special offer
PatG,"Adlington, Lancs",8/28/17,It's generally pretty fast but does drop occasionally for no apparent reason. Never had to contact customer service so I can't rate them.
Ali chaudhry,United Kingdom,8/28/17,Absolutely rubbish service for their customers.I got 2 phone lines for my business which we transferred from other companies and after everything BT said less then £30 per month but started sending us over £100 per month and they can't change it coz they trapped us in a contract.Never ever again in life.

What can I do"
Joe,Plymouth,8/26/17,
Laurence,Wales,8/26/17,"Just a warning about BT Infinity, the BT Hub becomes a Hotspot which you can not turn off unless you unplug the hub. Do not be surprised if you find people outside your home downloading porn or terrorist stuff from your internet. You could end up with a knock on the door from the police thanks to you giving access to your wireless. As a bit more of an insult you are paying for the electricity they use as well! BT keep very quite about how ""their"" hotspots are supplied, not surprisingly. If you are naive enough to have BTInfinity then always make sure your hub is turned off when not in use and enjoy the 6 o'clock knock from the police"
Shirley McKenzie,Wimbledon,8/26/17,"I have had a contract with BT for telephone, broadband and mobile (x3 sims)
There is not one day that goes by where there isn't an issue with the broadband and phone, mobiles have been OK but charged for extra data usage (owing to having to use more because of poor to no WiFi service!) I have made numerous complaints to BT and not one has been followed up, I get empty promises of phone calls and although customer service staff are apologetic (I genuinely believe they are, but as for the company, they don't give a monkeys) Every time it rains the service disconnects, you cannot imagine the frustration experienced when I lose my work online or my children lose their homework and have to complete again as the the internet cuts out with such regularity. In may this year I made yet another complaint and was advised to upgrade to ""their superfast hub"" nothing could have prepared me for how bad this was going to be!! The situation got worse and, as per previous comments, I was speaking to the Indian call centre ( this in itself is a big communication barrier (no pun intended) being Scottish and hearing impaired it was and is very difficult to communicate in ordinary conversation, add someone from Bangladesh and you have yourself a big dilemma!! So I started using the chat service on BT website (my BT) and one (Indian call centre staff member) representative wrote that I would never attain the speeds BT claimed as I was ""too close to the exchange "" and so I began taking screenshots to prove that BT knew they were selling me services they could not provide! Two weeks ago I wrote to the Ombudsman, I provided them a brief history of my experience and the continued issues and they agreed to look into it. I have heard every excuse in the book but when ""Ollie"" called me this week from BTs British complaint resolution department he told me that the reason for my connection problems was because of my TV Ariel!! To say I was flabbergasted is an understatement, I asked ""Ollie"" if he was having a laugh, (obviously not!!) I then told him I have not got a TV and haven't had one for 14 years and that my Ariel was cut prior to my moving into my home ( +7 years ago) Nonetheless he sent an engineer out for three days later, and when I relayed what Ollie stated he burst out laughing, told me that he was taking the pi$$ and he set about installation of a new line and made sure in was connected prior to leaving, low and behold, I still have a poor to non existing connection, best part is Ollie telling me he would recommend an Ariel installation company for me ""free of charge"" today I received a message from the telecommunications ombudsman to say they are doing a thorough investigation into BT and my complaints and will update me as soon as they have completed it!! Nonetheless BTbare still charging me despite agreeing to STOP taking money from my account!! I would advise anyone considering using the outfit known as BT to do some homework on their services before committing to a contract! I grudge giving them even one star, the whole thing has had me in tears at the lack of understanding, the sheer frustration at giving them almost two years of time to find a resolution and it has been to my detriment. On the plus side there is a service checker on the ifcom website that allows you to check the best service provider in your area, I would advise everyone to use it prior to committing to any contract! BT now refuses to discuss my complaint as it has been escalated to the ombudsman!!"
Clinton Gryke,Norton Bavant,8/26/17,"Little satisfaction from BT sales/help; poor service and a prominent disinclination to improve connection (speed and reliablility) when contacted. Having renewed for a year with promises to provide a good service, speed has dropped obviously over the last few weeks. Outrageous."
Matt,Milton Keynes,8/25/17,"Just don't do it.

New build took 11 weeks for Openreach to connect. I know some will say its a different company, but given they're BT branded you'd think they could have some sway.

Tried to connect me on 8th August, failed, didn't tell me. Phoned up on 9th, found out about failure, AND an engineer visit they booked which they needed to access my house for.

Got random automated email the following weekend stating I would be connected from the 15th. Phoned up, found our they'd fixed the 'routing problem' offsite... Had booked day off work for visit.

Now connected, but yet to receive the promised call from the complaints department after over a week.

Communication is terrible, and i would not suggest anyone goes near them."

stacy,durham,8/23/17,"Completely mis sold me fibre optic broadband last year. Lied about the service altogether. Fibre worked badly for about a month after it went live, I complained. BT assured me it was just till they worked out what my line could handle etc and the service would steady out soon. NEVER happened. Eventually I lost all service. BT offered to send me out an engineer at a potential cost of around £150. Subsequently when i made a complaint they have lost any trace of me ever calling or complaining and are pursuing me for terminating my contract early. When in fact they failed to deliver the service. AVOID."
Chris H,Ipswich IP8,8/21/17,"We're paying top dollar for a cheap 'n' nasty ""service"". Unfortunately, Virgin is even worse - really abysmal reliability, fluctuating speeds, and tight limits on the quantity of data transmitted even on their ""unlimited"" tariff.
At least the BT service is consistently bad, with their DNS restrictions (easily circumvented with a VPN) and lack of customer support. They took three weeks to connect the service!"
GKB,Hampshire,8/21/17,"On the 8th August 2017 I ordered a BT Line, Broadband and TV Package. Initial payment was taken on the 8th August 2017 for this service, thus at that point a contract was formed (I do understand law).

The earliest date I got for installation of these services was 24th August 2017 which was already a long lead time in my opinion and about which I complained.

On the 21st August I got an abrupt text message that said ""Your new appointment is 7th September 2017"". There was no explanation nor detail provided, which in itself is an appalling way to treat Customers.

I then contacted BT Customer Service Centre (oxymoron right there) which I understand is located in Bangalore. Although they are polite and try to be helpful they are totally ineffective at resolving any issues and it just ends up being a waste of time.

In essence in my experience BT are a totally incompetent and useless Broadband provder, do not honour their commitments and have apallimg Customer Service. Avoid!"
Rachel,Aberdeenshire,8/21/17,"After not having WiFi for around 6months finally got round to ordering some, had to wait nearly a month for my order to get fitted, which I took the day off work for. To find out that on the day for it to be fitted my order had failed and I would not be getting my broadband today. I had not been notified of this!! The man on the phone then offered to to set it up for me again, I was then put on hold for a ridiculous amount of time to where I had to hang up. I now need to re order even tho I have no idea which package I went for and will not probably have to wait another month for it to get fitted!! Ridiculous."

Raymund,Clydebank,8/20/17,"We've had difficulties with our broadband service for almost a year. Every time we answer the phone the router goes off. Tablets cut off, desktop courts off, our sons UNI work cuts off, its a joke.
I have been told its because we have trees near our home, I've been told its because we have a number of devices in our home and my favourite has to be, its because of the wet weather. We live in Scotland for God sake, it always rains.
My recent attempt to have this sorted was 18/8/17. I was told what I knew, its either the socket or the filter. I was told I could buy a filter locally as they are fairly inexpensive and, if I know a local electrician I could get them in.
Eventually got an engineer appointment booked. I got two texts reminding me of the booking, and then a third to tell me my broadband was working fine now and the engineer had been cancelled. Yes, they had magically sorted the problem by doing absolutely nothing to rectify the phone cutting out. I phoned back and the appointment is back on apparently, but with a different type of engineer. Let's see where this goes."
Hehir,Warwickshire,8/18/17,I have the miss fortune to have changed my broadband supplier from Sky to BT...! I now wish I'd just signed up again with Sky.. but the fancy adverts and promises of fast speed lulled me into making the decision to swap provider. Since changing we have had numerous issues just getting the service up and running... and now the service is so intermittent many of the services I intended to use are redundant... Its the last time I'll select BT for anything and will change to another provider as soon as I can build the strength to go through another router/modem change!
Vinesh,Greenford,8/18/17,Worst broadband ever. Their customer service is a joke. I have called them 19 times in 6 months its like they dont talk to each other as I always have to tell them the whole problem again. I have had problem after problem and its only been a year
Christopher mitchell,Edinburgh,8/17/17,
Customer ref GB08847343,OLDHAM,8/17/17,"Been a landline / infinity broadband / BT Sport TV customer for several years - on August 7th I renewed my contract on the strict understanding that I would be able to record BT Sport by exchanging my You View box for a You View Plus box. On that basis I was foolish enough to pay £208-80 landline fee 12 months in advance. Subsequently I have spoken to as many as nine individual BT employees in an attempt to resolve the recording issue by purchasing a You View Plus Box, quoted at £49 plus delivery. I have repeatedly been passed from person to person, placed on hold, hung up on, informed I need to also buy an additional TV package etc etc. Last night I again rang 0800 783 1401 number with the notion of either resolving the problem or cancelling my contract and requesting a refund. On this occasion I was kept on the line for one hour and 20 minutes while being passed to 3 different advisors, Chris in Doncaster, a lady and finally a Scotsman named John who assured me he'd have a brief word with his manager and get right back to me. 20 minutes later the connection was broken, leaving me absolutely fuming and my dinner burned to a crisp. Nevertheless, I rang 0800 783 1401 again this afternoon to cancel my contract but was persuaded by Amir Patel that the issue could be resolved, he would investigate and I could expect a call back in 30 minutes or so He said he'd generated a complaint ref No VOL013-235351101139 in the interim. Four hours later I have received no such call on either my landline or my mobile, both numbers having been supplied to BT. I have just called 0800 783 1401 yet again to cancel my contract within the 14 day cooling off period and to request a refund of the 12 months in advance landline charge which I am informed may take up to 7 working days to clear my account - took 5 minutes to leave my account. Ironically I also receive a BT bill yesterday and needless to say its also wrong. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing resulting in disgusting treatment for loyal, longstanding customers. Never again!!"
Barney Machen,London,8/17/17,"If I could give less than one star I would. This is the worst customer service experience I've had with any business. BT make mistakes, don't take ownership of those mistakes and lie to you. I have no other option of provider because BY have a monopoly on fibre broadband in the Catford Green development but their own systems don't recognise that they provide this so they just send you round and round in circles.

I would not recommend working with BY to anyone!"
David,Gloucestershire,8/17/17,Very poor reliability and the customer service is none existent..
Mrs Cobb,Derby,8/17/17,Our broadband service has been consistently bad the entire length of our contract with BT both excruciatingly slow and intermittent every single day. Faults never get fully resolved and customer service doesn't help with the situation. When we eventually moved home and didn't want to take BT with us we had to pay out the rest of our contract even though they had not held up their end of the contract. So basically the only person in contract is you not BT.
Abi,Orpington,8/16/17,"The worst internet broadband provider ever compare to virgin and seethelight. BT with his customer services officers are the worst in the business. I am paying £44.96 for phone and infinity 76mb. My internet is always dropping and the speed is rubbish. BT it has sent me 7 internet hubs and open reach engineers to try and resolve the problem. Customer services officers in Dakata are very rude and unprofessional. Sent email to complaint to BT over a week ago, a lady called Pooja ring me from India asking me for my full name,address, telephone without introducing herself, I have to forced her name out of her mouth. BT has refused to compensate me for the inconvenience and time taking off work . I will never recommend BT to anyone."

N Hardwick,Derbyshire,8/15/17,
JD,"Orkney, Scotland",8/15/17,"My elderly parents live in a remote house on an Island in Orkney, Scotland. They have been through a tortuous year with BT as their ""service"" provider.

They have now been completely without a landline or internet for 11 weeks, let alone any chance of broadband. My father has been building a new house over the past few years next to the original croft cottage he owns. In November 2016 he contacted BT to ask them to move the line from the old house to the new house and was told this could not be done until February 2017.

The phone line then developed a fault around December 2016/January 2017 time and an engineer was not sent out until February. The engineer repaired the fault but would not move the phone line.

My father phoned BT again to be told that the line would be moved on the 19th May.

At this point, the ""executive complaints department"" took over following a complaint. BT then came back saying that my parents would need to register the new house as a different address, despite it being literally next door to the original house. Cutting this part of the story short, the planning department at the council agreed that this was not necessary.

The BT engineer failed to turn up on the 19th May, and my parent's landline and internet were both completely cut off by BT on this date. Since then, there have been 4 more arranged dates on which engineers were supposed to turn up but have not done so, with no notice or explaination.

11 weeks after the phone was cut off and the best part of year since my father asked BT to move the line and he is no closer to getting it sorted. The ""executive complaints department"" has been phoning my father on his mobile regularly but is unable to tell him why the engineers have not kept to their appointments or when they will actually turn up to fix the problem.

My parents have also been in touch with the Ombudsmen, the local MP and the local newspaper and are no closer to getting a resolution, which is why I am posting on here on their behalf (they have no internet to do so themselves!)

BT has a Universal Service Obligation to provide all households in the UK with a landline, even in remote parts of the country, and they are certainly not fulfilling this.

To have a working phone is a lifeline on a remote island as the mobile signal is not always great. My Father is in his 70's and my mother, her late 60's and are currently without any reliable way to contact the emergency services should the need arise."
James,Mildenhall,8/14/17,
Melanie,Kent,8/14/17,Such a shame BT sell you a product then tell you two years later that you do not even receive the minimum speed because you do the speed checker and they tell you there is a fault. To add insult to injury they take from February until July after a second complaint made to get someone who speaks English to call you. No compensation! A 12 month offer on a lower speed ( because they can't supply the one they sold you in the first place) and when you call to cancel the bt sports (which was free to begin with) they make another offer which is good but no can do as we have already chosen to leave you!! A big fat con! Feel really cheated out of lots of money! AVOID
Cameron Hall,Rokeby Inn,8/11/17,"Lack of customer regard or care. Would not recommend to anyone wanting a land line and/or internet.
Recently, I got a letter from BT about our service, and when reading I found out that my mother's name was still on the bill, something I have trying to sort out for years, clearly with no progress. However two weeks ago something must have changed as when I woke on Friday 4th August, I found out I had lost all internet. As a business owner (hotel and restaurant) this is a major problem as I lost connection to all social media advertisement, but even more worryingly, all online bookings (resulting in me having to stop taking online bookings, a majority of my bookings). Customers and residents expect internet as it is advertised, so we had to apologise saying I will try and sort it out on Monday (with BT being closed after 5pm Friday until Monday). Things went from bad to worse when my son informed me that he couldn't phone us up. When enquiring further, I discovered that our phone number no longer worked (for no explained reason). I later found out the BT had changed our number without informing me. I was no a business owner with no way of taking bookings. Without internet, there is no way I can update my website or social media to my new unwanted number, and all my business cards have the incorrect number on. I had to last the weekend without any phone or internet connection (unable to take any bookings or get in contact with us for enquiries or reservation) hoping that it would be sorted by someone at BT on Monday. On Monday, I got in contact with a woman at BT and asked her to fix the change. I spent hours on the phone and made no progress. The next day I tried to get in contact with the same woman but it just rang through, no-one picking up as though she was ignoring me. As a result, I had to start the whole process again with another member of the BT staff. Once again, I spent hours on the phone (from 10 until 12:30) and made no progress. My wife then got in contact with someone else at BT, who promised to sort it out, yet we haven't heard back from him. I then recalled someone at BT and get through to another member of staff. This gentleman seemed to get really annoyed with me and was not polite at all. He told me that he would sort out the internet and phone problem in 24 working hours. It had now been 5 days without phone or internet, and was going to be a further 2 days. Any l business owner would tell you problems like this can put immense pain and stress on a business; financially, and emotionally. I waited 24 working hours, and still, no improvement. I recalled BT and when through the hours long process again, only to get told at the end that they would not be able to correct the phone-line and internet 'for at least a few weeks'. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! No small business can last weeks with no bookings, no reservations, and no enquiries. With a lack of customer service, or care and no-one from BT feeling any remorse, and worst of all, no apology for changing the phone-line and removing the internet with no warning, I would not recommend BT to anyone."
David Henderson,SHROPSHIRE,8/11/17,"Look at all the negative reviews. All these people can't be wrong. And they aren't. AVOID BT. I have been trying to correct an overcharging error on my account since I joined 12 months ago. I have wasted hours and hours with BT and got nowhere. They are currently overcharging me by £100 and have disconnected my broadband despite being involved in a dispute resolution process with the ombudsman over this.

Their customer service is absolutely hopeless.

BT need to realise that there are a finite number of potential customers in the UK and once they have annoyed/frustrated/ripped off the majority of these, they will no longer have a viable business"

Clive smith,Hampshire,8/10/17,"Experienced static on phone line and internet kept dropping out,so phoned bt Customer service. Gentleman was polite and carried checks and said an engineer needed to call, so told him i would have to phone back with date as we both work. My partner arranged time of so we phoned bt to be told it was an external problem and an engineer would be despatched and it WOULD be fixed by the 3rd/08/2017 so we waited. By the 4th we still had the same problem, so contacted bt again and this time were told could not book engineer appointment as it was an external fault, however when i told them they had already supposedly fixed the external problem they suddenly could book an engineer, finally we thought the problem is going to get fixed, HOW WRONG WE WERE. Today 09/08/17 we recieved a text Message from bt with links so that we can check the equipment for ourselves and if bt send an engineer and find the fault is not there equipment then we will have to pay them
£129.99 for the engineers visit. SURELY THIS IS WHAT YOU PAY YOUR LINE RENTAL AND BILLS FOR, ITS CALLED PIECE OF MINDAT LEAST. Have now cancelled contract and the new company are going to check everything for free(no charge)WILL NEVER USE BT AGAIN."
Ally,Hatton,8/9/17,Have a smart tv and firestick hopeless with my current broadband. Buffers all the time. Exchange is fibre enabled but they tell me I'm to far away a whole 500 yards!! and its a new build with brand new cables! Ridiculous.
Katie,,8/8/17,"Such a bad internet connection, the devices says I have internet yet I have to turn the box on and off for it to work. I have contacted many times explain my problem but never seems to get fixed definitely need to start ooomsing for another broadband!"
ken,ruthin,8/8/17,"Moved to BT and what a big mistake. Broadband speed went down to less than 1mb, connection kept on dropping out, totally useless.... customer service is non existent, when you eventually get through to customer service they either put the phone down or cannot understand English and don't listen at all... also if your paying via direct debit they take double payments on various dates and when you come to the end of your contract they add charges to change provider. all of this I have documented proof of... I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE AND WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN FOR ANY SERVICES"
Christina Gibson,Northern Ireland,8/6/17,"I changed to BT from Sky in the knowledge that BT are the leaders in broadband technology. What a mistake that was!! My internet is so bad that it took me 1 hour to lodge a complaint on the BT website. Was contacted by staff who assured me my internet speed is good and the fact that I cannot stream a movie while sitting 10 foot away from the router is down to interference. Told me to get an Ethernet cable and plug it into my iPad?!? I questioned why I never suffered from interference while with Sky and had perfect connection. Staff proceeded to try and upsell me further products in order to receive a satisfactory broadband service. I stated I would not be paying more money and I felt like BT were conning customers and extorting money from them by providing a poor service in order to upsell. The staff members manager was supposed to call me back but didn't.
The BT website is not user friendly for making a complaint and I believe BT are being dishonest with the service they offer. Stuck with them for 12 months now unfortunately, hopefully they'll increase their prices and give me a get out :( worst internet service since dial up!"
Daniel Burrows,Banham Norfolk,8/5/17,Our broadband speed here is 0.48 MBS which in this day and age is pathetic.Ive made countless phone calls to BT and nothing has been done except sending out an engineer and he couldn't improve the speeds as such lower power coming into the property.I have 4 children all studying and run my own business from home so we rely on the internet very much.
Natasha,London,8/5/17,"If I could give a review of less than 1 star, I would. Never in my life have I encountered such gross incompetence. Couldn't care less about their customers and their staff are just awful. My internet wasn't working for 3 months last year, yet I'm still stuck in a contract and they refuse to give me my money back. Wouldn't ever, ever recommend them to anyone."
Ant,Wrexham,8/5/17,The worst piece of garbage that I have ever paid for
Kiran,Solihull,8/3/17,"We were stuck with BT for months. We tried to cancel after the broadband was so slow it was literally unusable, but their customer service was so bad it took many hours and phone calls before they actually did it. At first they just tried to tell us it was impossible"
Dale,London,8/2/17,"Abysmal 3 Months

Currently stuck with BT at the moment.

Was unfortunately lulled into a false sense of trust and security by one smooth experience with them in the past. This seems like a distant memory now after 3 months of beyond the worst imaginable customer service.

To elaborate on this just a little... our original order for TV and broadband was mysteriously cancelled by one of bt's own staff members and the same individual brazenly called us and suggested we had cancelled it until we were eventually told it was due to a 'supplier issue' and reorderd the package for us. There has been later suggestion that the offshore workers cancel orders and put new ones through in order to earn commission and simulate a sale that they have made... Only they did not put through a replica of the deal that we ordered. It was put through with none of the add ons, with 3 mysterious connection charges adding up to 169.99 (£100 more than the original order), a lower broadband speed than was offered at the time of the original order and at a higher rate of expense. The cancellation meant we had to wait longer for our internet services to be switched on and a lot longer for the TV package to be fixed. Three months down the line we further still don't have the free upgrade to the higher speed broadband package that was on offer when we placed the original order, we have now been declined cashback through a third party because the original order was cancelled and therefore not tracked (this is something that is no fault of our own but sees us £90 down - an incentive behind our choice taken away from us). All this doesn't even take into account the time that my partner and I have had to waste talking to bt representatives, incredibly disruptive to both work and free time. Representatives that call randomly (instead of ant previously agreed times) and make it incredibly difficult to get back in touch with them. I don't think any of them read the notes, we were constantly having to spend time re-explaining the complete mess they had made of it. Very few positives to be said for the process and absolutely no sign of an apology. Our open complaint seems to have now disappeared for a second time and there seems to be no level of accountability being taken - it's as if we are wasting their time.

To top this off, our broadband stopped working 6 days ago. We logged the issue with them and there was supposed to be a three day turnaround. What actually appears to have happened is they have closed the initial log as complete (pretending they met their SLA) and then re-logged the issue themselves at a later date... 6 days on we are still waiting with no internet and no contact from BT.

This really is only the key points and I think I could now spend weeks writing a book on the failings of BT.

I can't recommend due to their inability to provide a reliable service or react with any level of problem solving ability and customer care when things do go wrong. We still live in hope that they show us some respect and somehow turn it around."
Chris,Preston,8/2/17,"Terrible, terrible and worse than terrible. I moved to the UK from the US. Prior tenants had used BT fibre broadband and TV so I contacted them and requested same plus phone. After three weeks of waiting, 6+ phone calls to BT's incompetent staff, multiple nonsensical explanations as to why they hadn't activated my broadband, a visit by a confused BT phone tech who had no idea why he was sent to check my perfectly operating phone line, multiple broken promises and lies in several different accents, no e-mail updates or any kind of return communications from BT (including a BT rep who scheduled a day and time to call me and never did) and their inability to set up my tv whilst the broadband wasn't connected, I gave up. BT is probably the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of trying to work with. British radio is wonderful, but three weeks disconnected from the outside world was too much. Fortunately, Sky for tv was an absolute joy to work with and Zen for fibre broadband was equally uncomplicated. If the B in BT stands for British then they are a national disgrace."
Tommy,Manchester,8/2/17,"Absolute scum of the earth. When the bt broadband contract runs out they hype the cost up massively and don’t tell you. When you come to renew they don’t give you the same deal as a new customer can get on their website, they expect you to pay more. Absolutely no loyalty. And when you say you want to cancel and go with another company they make it really difficult and put you through to these people who have a really bad attitudes and speak to you like your stupid. Trying to negotiate with the price when all I want to do is leave them and not get messed about. And then they charge you for ending the contract even though its out of contract. Awful experience. I will never go with BT for as long as I live. I’d rather pay more with another company. I would recommend avoiding BT at all costs."
Matt Keylock,England,8/1/17,"Awful, don't get. My internet has not gone a full day without shutting off at least 3 times. At the moment it is shutting off every 10 or so minutes. Customer service is awful as they haven't a clue what they are doing. In the end after 3 calls we were told to disconnect our phones when needing wifi, disconnect all other electronic devices that require wifi and finally to just ""reset it"" - spoiler alert none of these worked. They all made it worse and ended up getting rid of our home phones for three days. Don't listen to their offers as they are liars about that too. Joke of an internet provider -_-"
Graham,WIGAN,7/31/17,
Iain Lewis,North Berwick,7/31/17,"As I wasmoving house on 25.07.2017, I contacted BT on 23.06.2017 to arrange to transfer my phone line and broadband to my new address. The person to whom I spoke was very helpful, I was informed that both the phone line and broadband would be switched on 25.07.2017, and the order was confirmed in an email within a few minutes of our conversation.
After about two weeks I began to receive phone calls and text messages from a succession of BT employees, the effect of which was that there were supposedly problems which were going to delay the change-over of my service. They were non-specific about timescales but it was clear that weeks of delay would be involved. Each person to whom I spoke was very reluctant to explain what the problem was. They disclaimed knowledge of the 23.06.2017 order.
They use terminology which frankly is gibberish, but which is clearly intended to confuse and make customers believe that some really serious problem has arisen. When I pressed for an explanation, I was given a variety of excuses, leading to the clear impression that they were simply making it up as they went along. BT's communications with me continue to be designed to confuse rather than assist, and the timeline on my on-line account does not reflect the reality of what actually happened.
I am therefore thoroughly dissatisfied with BT and do not feel that I can deal with them on any basis of trust. If it was possible to rate their customer service and my overall satisfaction with a minus number, I would do so."
Ryan,Runcorn,7/30/17,"BEWARE Beware Beware,
After 2 months they will increase your bill. And there's nothing you can do about it. If you are desperate enough to go with this filthy company, and don't want to listen to anyone's advice. RECORD your telephone calls. Also Beware of the CESSATION CHARGE!!!!! They won't tell you about it until you want to leave then slap £32 when you want to switch provider.. Advise if your already in a contract with BT and are trying to leave them. Tell them you live in Hull, because they cannot provide services to Hull therefore cannot charge the CESSATION charge. I will never ever go with this company or any other company affiliated with BT. Libby Bar and the rest of the cronies should of been sacked a long time ago"
HarpyG,Devon,7/30/17,"BT promise 'up to' 17 Mbps. Speeds can reach between 14 and 16 Mbps during the day but in the evening, when we need it most, it drops to between 4 and 5. I see BT has promised the government it can provide 10Mbps for the whole of the country. BT are as slippery as hell and will take their measurement at the time most people are asleep and in their beds. You cannot trust BT to be truthful."

Graeme,South uist,7/27/17,"Less than Uessless we have been waiting on basic broadband to be connected for 7 weeks and been given 8 dates with all being a no show. The house had broadband 3 months ago so must be a simple matter of turning it back on but no not for bt and open reach who now say we can't have broadband at our house. Every other house in the street and terrace has it. I am not happy about the way they treat there customers. Very poor worst company I have dealt with in a long time.

Don't use bt if you can."
J Singh,Cheshire,7/26/17,"Months have gone by, no broadband. I am racking up huge bills on the BT mobile. Which? rated this as UKs worst broadband and for good reason. No service for months and they want to charge me £450 for leaving when in fact contract obligations have not been fulfilled by BT and therefore the contract should be terminated. I spend hours daily chasing them around the world. Its a disgrace for a company to care so little about their customers and just leave them for months without contact or call backs. Never again"
khureem,MK,7/26/17,"Initially when I started service with BT, it kept going off everyday for a month and when I called BT, the customer service guy tells me that this is normal and happens with every customer. I replied saying, that's a very promising service you are giving (sarcastically) and it kept going on and off through out the year. However, I had to move houses before my end of contract, I called them to ask the charges for early termination and I was told, it would be cheaper to continue contract until end of it rather than cancelling it now, hearing that, I decided to continue until end of contract, but within a week, an email was sent to me saying, your broadband has been cancelled and you will be charged £ 110 ! getting a shock, I called BT services and they kept telling me they had sent me an email that someone else would take over your line (even though there was no communication) Eventually, after loads of arguments, it was decided they would refund me everything as they couldn't provide services in my new house. And here i'm 15 days after refund processing, I still haven't received any refund.

Probably I would never go for BT Services again in my life .Worst customer service.

If I could, I would give a negative rating."
Ray,Brighton,7/26/17,"Beware of all BT charges, transparency

Recently advised BT the required 30 days’ notice (not to renew) prior to the renewal date (late August 2017) of the 12 month fibre optic broadband contract.

Although this contract will end after the 12 month contractual period (no early cancellation), I still have to pay the £31 charge for stopping BT broadband, the cessation fee.

On commencement of the contract BT charged for broadband setup, router postage amounting to £56.95 (disclosed and transparent). Normal monthly broadband charges apply (disclosed and transparent)

This cessation charge of £31 was not transparent and mentioned when I took the service 12 months ago and was only brought to my attention when I decided not to renew the BT broadband contract.

Ofcom should enforce that all charges associated with a broadband contract (upfront and cessation charges) are clearly highlighted/disclosed and made transparent in all marketing information by relevant companies offering such services."
RIchard Williams,Lancashire,7/25/17,"People beware, while their initial offer may see great, they do not hesitate in increasing your monthly costs, give you terrible broadband service, take money for something you do not receive and then state you must renew your contract in order for you to continue the support on their equipment.

There are better services out there and would deter anyone from using BT. Too expensive, lie to the customers and basically steal money without consent.

Your choice, but please look at other reviewers, we cannot all be wrong can we?"

Carl Evans,Belfast,7/22/17,"Overall satisfaction? Disgrace. It took 3 months for us to get up and running, multiple engineer appointments whereby the engineer never turned up. Passed between several case managers who failed to deliver on their promises. Tricked into contract extensions. Mis-sold. Fobbed off by their customer services who claim there is no manager. I'm concerned for any business with no manager! No adherence to OFCOM or Ombudsman rights in their call centre. Internet speed is bang average. But not worthwhile given the horrible customer service and inefficient tech support and engineers.

I cannot wait for Virgin to offer their services to all of NI, not just Belfast, because BT will be annihilated. And that's what they deserve in 2017."
Liam Bennett,London,7/22/17,
Nicky Parker,Hertfordshire,7/22/17,"The most appalling customer service ever. Our (always slow) broadband crashed during a thunderstorm. We made approx 20 to 30 calls, plus using online customer service. The engineer didn't show up on 2 consecutive days, despite us being told he was booked in. Online service told us it was the fault of our (brand new) router & that it was 'out of warranty'. 4 days work lost, still no solution. Utterly complacent company. Next week we're changing provider."
Joe Askew,Beaconsfield,7/22/17,"I have been a BT customer for 23 years, never really had to complain. However if you are considering getting the infinity 2 service let me share my woes with you and perhaps save you a) some money and b) a whole load of stress.

So Sept 2015 I upgraded from infinity to infinity 2 – THE fibre optic network, so they told me. Speeds of 80 Meg! Up load speeds in excess of 20 meg and down load speeds of 75+meg. From day one slower than my previous speeds. With one or two occasions where it preformed as per contract.

Using the Speed test on this page – I began logging the speeds to report back to BT – a few months later, when I was ready – I presented the findings – First off BT refused to accept the data collected using the speed test on this page - so I had to use the BT Wholesale test. Interesting that it gave me about a 10-20% difference in it’s favour against the one here...

So trying to get BT to sort it out was just so frustrating – First off Billing and Delivery will bat you between the both of the groups detailing it is not their problem. Eventually you will get some overworked person in their call centre in Mumbai, who will try and at least give you some proper customer service. Sadly they will fail. If like me you get frustrated enough to flag it to the ombudsman here is where they get you.

First off, their contract is written in such a way, you – as the customer do not have a leg to stand on. You are dealing with a company within a company. BT will front the deal, however it will be delivered through Openreach and that is where the first frustration starts.

The contract then goes on to state that if they deliver ANY service/speed in their books they are delivering service and under the code of practice that is good enough, as they are still delivering a service, therefore you as the customer cannot complain and should you call them out to ‘check’ the line – you will be presented with a further £120 call out charge (IF the engineer does turn up). So, if you like a service that states 80 meg and you pay for an 80 Meg service, yet are happy to have half of that as a minimum, then sign up to the Infinity 2 service, which when one goes out of contract will only get worse!

Do not listen to their customer services – they tell untruths. I was supposedly meant to have my bill suspended pending investigation. They turned my service off, battered my credit rating, gave no contact details and finally presented me with a final reminder stating all sorts of pain and suffering through the courts. Once you are cut off from BT they will only give you recoded messages telling you they will only deal with you once you have settled your bill – the loop of frustration. No human interaction until your bill is settled.

The Ombudsman services have done the best they can – and against an 18 month bill of over £580 paying for their 80 Meg service and receiving less than half the speeds. I got £10 for non turn up of engineer and a ‘Good Will’ gesture of ...£50!

Do yourself a favour and only consider BT as a last ditched attempt to service. Yes after 23 years, I will be moving all my services away from them – Customer service is a word branded about by BT, but frankly I am not sure they know what it means."
Mathew,London,7/21/17,"Sould be zero stars for speed and reliability. Have had issues the whole 12 months of our contract.

Getting 1.5Mbps (on a good day) when we should be getting 25-27Mbps, usually not a good enough connection to watch BT sport's so we're paying £60 a month for nothing!

Have had technician/engineer visit, house wiring tested, replaced router, all the while having an unusable connection for approximately 6 months straight.

If you can, please, for your own sake avoid BT."
PhilipWhitaker,Sandwich,7/20/17,Consistently below 1mp!
Dean,London,7/19/17,"Absolute shambles, with just some of the problems being:
* Before I signed up I was told I'd be able to transfer the contract to someone else, which later turned out to be rubbish I was subsequently told that I'd first have to pay off the contract which entirely defeats the point.
* I was told to wait in for the engineer to set everything up, and only to find out after the timeslot (when I called to find out where the engineer was) that it wasn't actually required thus wasting a day of holiday.
* The connection itself would randomly die and take a long time to sort itself.
* Whenever I called about problems with the connection I was fobbed off with excuses, with nothing ever resolved or any of the callbacks actually done.
* The router itself was awful, and sometimes took over an hour (which I timed) to restart.
* There were various hidden charges, such as setting up the phone line, removing it, an extortionate fee for the sub-standard router.
* The price was increased early on in the contract, with the (legally required) notification email either never being sent or being buried in so much spam from BT that no one had any hope of seeing it.
* The customer support is inconsistent, which different people telling you different things.
* I asked to end the contract early as I moved house, but once this was done was then told that I'd be charged extra. I was also then told AFTER I'd cancelled it that these charges would not be applied if I'd just let the contract expire, but by this point it was apparently too late.

I'd recommend people to use ANYTHING but BT."
daniel,mountain ash,7/19/17,"absolutely useless the speed is clearly incorrect as it is constantly
freezing. When you use a normal line speed test it is very very low and then BT knows you have done it on their line speed so they speed your broadband up. Just proves they can control your line speed and are annoying you on purpose"
Johnb,London,7/18/17,"Useless company. Asked to connect my house when I was abroad a month in advance. Arrived at home to find a letter asking me to confirm installation date. You couldn't make it up, an internet company sending a letter asking for confirmation to connect your broadband. So I had to wait 10 days for them to connect it.
Then after a year I moved house , the dates changed and I gave them 12 days notice that I wished to move the date to 5 days in advance of the original one. Come the original day I'd set and they disconnected me 5 days before our move and would not reconnect me. Disgraceful company. Avoid at all cost."

In my opinion everybody who reads my review don't go with them or at least make sure %100 of everything don't go on their word!"
Rob Woodrow,"Cannock, Staffordshire",7/14/17,
Mark,Nutley,7/13/17,I believe BT as a company borders on the criminal. Their system is to manipulate their customers into believing you are their no 1 priority but this could not be further from the truth. I was coerced into signing a new contract with BT in order to get a new router and and fix the ongoing very poor broadband which constantly drops out. Once the contract was signed there was no end of excuses and mistakes made by BT until I ran out of patience and am now having to take legal proceedings against them. They are without doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with and do not recommend anyone updating their contracts. As long as BT has a monopoly on the lines we as customers will continue to face this nightmare situation of dealing with bt!

I call and they said ""there is no fibre cable or infinity in your area"". So i had to place another order for regular broadband. This arrives 10 days later - does not work. Call and they test line, they book an engineer. Engineer comes and says BT should have noticed there were two lines to this property, and haven't. I said I wanted infinity package but could as there was no fibre in the area - he took me outside to show me the fibre cable and my neighbour came out and I asked them what they had - Infinity BT package. Its not just that but the internet is rubbish. I use my neighbours SKY internet mosts nights as it is better and stronger - our houses aren't even attached. I made a complaint and had to follow up and chase it a million times. Each time I got someone new in another country who hadn't read my file and so on. I even at one point asked ""can i have my account number as i have not received any paperwork"", the woman said ""yes if you give me your account number I can access your account and get you your information"". Truly shocking service and contradicting all the time. When i complained and wanted to cancel,they were going to charge me for cancelling the service. Wont even get into the rest of it as there is a novel full of stuff that has happened last 8 weeks.

Today we haven't had internet for 5 days now and this morning they let me know that they haven't booked anyone yet but if i want to they can find someone for Tuesday. Wich means that 3 more days we I will have no internet.
This company is a nightmare and the way they operate is unacceptable. Slowest customer service ever. I'm very disappointed and I will change provider if I am not satisfied with the response I receive."
Rob,Newcastle,7/1/17,"The only thing worse than BT broadband is their customer service.
The internet barely goes a day without failing, often dropping out every 5-10 minutes. Even with the best package it struggles to have more than two devices connected to it and using it at the same time. I have ended up having to increase my mobile data allowances twice purely due to the unreliable BT broadband.

The only good thing about BT is the open zone."
Richard,London,6/30/17,"Constant disconnections, apparently asking for a reliable broadband service is asking for too much these days! BT and Virgin Media have been absolute nightmares ."
akdj,axlknxln,6/29/17,"utterly awful to be brutal, way overcharged, say you will get 50mb but only receive 20."
Owen,Daventry,6/29/17,I would rather pay double than use BT ever again. They seem incapable of fixing a problem without you having to spend hours on the phone. 31 days and counting to fix a premium mail issue.
Melanie,Daventry,6/29/17,Customer service is PANTS! Products are ok but if you have an issue you are in for hours of painful phone calls.
john,Manchester,6/29/17,bt were very good but the last few months have been a nightmare they are over subscribed but will not admitt it
Neil,Hants,6/28/17,"We had bt in 2014 it would not function properly from the day it was installed we persevered for two months constantly trying to contact BT's ignorant call centres that would say it's a line problem, let's try re starting your hub, we have an engineer working on it in your area. They actually refused to send out an engineer to our house despite numerous calls. In the end we were fed up and told them that their services were not fit for purpose to which they told us we could cancel the contract. The next thing we know is almost two years later out of the blue bt send us a bill for a years contract because we cancelled it. Went to the ombudsman and they were useless after investigating the matter for three months they told us that bt have to apologise for the time lapse without contacting us but that we will still have to pay the bill. Bt did not issue the apology to us but the ombudsman sent us a copy of the one that was apparently issued to them. Bt are a faceless, rip off, nightmare that will mess you around all day long especially once they have your money. They just want your money and once they have got it they couldn't give a monkeys."
Andrew,Northants,6/28/17,"I have no issues with my current BT set up it works fine. I am however changing my ISP because BT cannot solve issues(well my issue) without you having to to be called, or you call them, over 30 times and counting to fix something.

They lie

I have been told my issue is fixed 4 times. It has not been.

I have never spoken to the same person in customer non service team.

They lie.

They created a false account to supposedly fix my issue which they assured me would be deleted and then started to charge me for it. Oh! and they can't cancel it straight away for some unknown reason.

Some of there customer non service team are polite but most are rude and don't listen to you.

They call you back at the wrong times.

They cut you off.

They put you on hold for 10 minutes.

You try their live chat and they fix the problem. Yeah! Oh! maybe not. They lie to you saying your problem is fixed as it is still there the next day.

Have I mentioned that they lie.

They say your issue is now solved can we close the complaint. You say yes thanks for solving my problem. The next day the issue is still there. Never ever close a complaint until you are sure it is done otherwise you start all over again.

In the last couple of months I have spoken to BT more than my friends and family and my issue is not resolved.

If you enjoy pain in your life then sign up for BT broadband. If I could give 0 marks I would.

When my switch is complete I am going to smash all there equipment up and post it to them. Oh! and because it was a nightmare joining BT. I have 4 sets of stuff. They messed up my order so badly, they kept cancelling it and doing another order so I ended up with 4 sets!

BT are incompetent idiots.

I feel much better after that."
Karan Kapoor,Birmingham,6/27/17,"Ridiculous! I placed a Business order with BT over 2 weeks ago. When I was placing the order and they were agreeing to take my money they were more than happy to tell me that my order will be completed and fitted within 10 working days. So 10 working days went by and nothing, so I rang BT myself to find out what was going on and I was told they were waiting to do a credit check, so why did nobody contact me to do this, I had to ring BT myself to do the credit check, now all of that has been done, here I am again nearly 3 weeks later and I'm still waiting, i am literally on hold to BT while I am writing this review, the order has still not gone through. How ridiculous and disgusting is this that nearly 3 weeks after I placed my order that it still has not even been put through, this is an order for a business line, so the amount of money that is slipping by me because my customers cannot call or email me because I have no internet is ridiculous. I cannot believe that BT can be so unprofessional, especially when it comes to handling their business customers, how can you allow my business to suffer the way that it is and you are doing nothing about it. I cannot believe how ridicules BT have been, it's my own fault for choosing such a company"
Huw Evans,London,6/23/17,"This is by far the worst company that I have ever dealt with.

Customer service pfft... to call this a service is an insult to any service people across the globe. Every time that I have phoned them they have been incredibly rude, dismissive and aggravating. If I could have given zero stars I would have.

Now I don't want to bore you with specifics of my case, so if you aren't interested skip over this paragraph. After BT hiked their prices again (the second time in 12 months) I phoned up to cancel, which they assured me would be free as they had broken their side of the contract. Lo and behold they tried to charge me the cancellation fee (oh sorry our prices are extortionate, please before you go we can offer you the absolute worst deal we have for double the money of our competition. Not interested? Well that'll be £31 for the privilege of taking your business elsewhere). I explained that they had broken contract so I shouldn't be charged, and they said that they had sent the letter out weeks before I had received it. An argument happened, they refused to do anything. Long story short I left BT (paying the fee). Joke's on them though, as a landlord I manage multiple properties, all of which used to be with BT; now none of them are. Was only going to change one house. Estimated loss to BT's business = 16 x 52 x 12 = £9,984 per year. Amount gained in cancellation fees 16 x 31 = £496.

Honestly even if they offered me the service for free, I wouldn't go with them. Not worth the hassle."
Yasmin,UK,6/23/17,"I would give BT 0 stars if possible. They have quite possibly the worst customer service team possible. After refusing to cancel my account they still continued to charge me up to 15 pounds per month for an account I did not want. I am unsure of this is borderline theft however I am appalled at the provided services: an email I cannot access, overly excessive monthly charges for a limited email account, no accessible customer services team able to cancel a simple email account.

DO NOT SIGN UP"
cristina,ha8 9ed,6/23/17,I wouldnt recommend BT to anyone as they are very expensive and service is bad. Most companies are like this but to be honest they win the crown
Steve,Rhondda Cynon Taff,6/23/17,"I have had 3 engineers to look at my broadband. The first one said that rats have chewed the cables in the exchange and to fix the problem the road would have to be dug up. BT don't want to know, and their telephone operators are the most ignorant I have ever dealt with. Appalling customer service."
Steffan,,6/23/17,"I have been a BT customer for only a couple of months and I have had the worst customer experience of my life. After signing up for their deal with a usage cap, I was unable to log in to my BT email account because of an error message, which meant I did not receive any emails about my usage. So my bill was £100 for 1 month. After wasting hours of my time on the phone trying to fix my email over 3-4 weeks they have still not fixed the error message. In the meantime I upgraded to infinity and the representative even said to me that it was the end of his shift as an excuse as to why his system was failing to accept my email address format when upgrading! In the end he was laughing at the system because he knew how dumb it is! The residential team even referred me onto the business team to fix the email issue, to which the business team joked back at me saying how dumb the residential team are at referring them on to the wrong team. In the end I have received a total of approximately 10-15 calls from BT some of which took an hour and my BT email is still not working. What a total waste of time!

The broadband speed is ok but everything else awful, avoid BT they will leave you feeling angry and annoyed and helpless."
Marlen,London,6/23/17,"A service I would not recommend to anyone in my right mind. Really early on we started having connectivity issues; the wi-fi would appear to be connected although there was no internet there. We have since started contacting BT. A nightmare to get to talk to someone but I guess that you would expect from a large company and it would be OK if you get a solution to the problem. However, the people in customer service although very polite they have been unable to identify the problem and provide a solution to. It has always been ""turn your modem off, turn it on again, oh it is working now!"". Has it been a faulty modem device issue from the very beginning? We will never get to know. The bottom line is that after so many phone- calls, effort to get help and patience no solution has been offered, bearing in mind that I wouldn't mind paying for a repair if someone would check and suggest a specific one. It is a very poor service provided whilst BT keeps increasing their monthly fee. Our connection to the internet is unpredictable, a constant on and off and nowhere to turn to for technical support. Please, do never choose BT!"
Aaron,Titchfield,6/22/17,"I pay an increased price for fibre which I don't actually receive as I'm too far from the exchange. I'm still supposed to receive 10-12mb but actually get closer to 6mb on a good day. I paid for an engineer to move my master socket only for the speed to lower further. When contacting BT they inform me that any engineer visit is likely to charge me the call out fee again. Customer service is unbearably tedious and repetitive, to the point where I can no longer be bothered phoning. I've bought my own 3rd party router which has helped with reliability."
Katie,Cirencester,6/21/17,
Dave,Braintree,6/20/17,On most expensive fibre package - long term ongoing problems - impossible to contact and report problems (min 30 min wait on phone) resulting in very expensive and unusable service. Avoid like the plague.
Mark Mcfarland,Kilwinning,6/20/17,Terrible broadband speed and customer service. Im tied in until Feb 2018. Are there any get out clauses?
Lyn,London,6/20/17,"Bunch of crooks. Been with BT for more than 10 years and I am paying close to £45/mth for my broadband package for nothing special. They have amazing online offers for NEW customers for half the price for the exact same package yet whenever I call their Customer Options Team to see if they are happy to offer me the same deal as a long-term customer, it is always a NO with no valid reason and best they can do is chop off £6/month. Big whoopee. They are happy to screw over existing customers and I are fed up of their conniving immoral ways and will be looking elsewhere."
Nicola,Sheffield,6/19/17,"As a student moving back home to my parents' house after completing my degree I was surprised to find myself charged with a £31 cancellation fee after using BT services for 2 years. My parents already use BT services at their home so I cannot carry the service to my new address and cannot change service providers as I am moving out. I was also asked to pay for the services for a further 30 days despite me not requiring internet after moving out. Last year when I rang BT I was told to ring back within 30 days of moving out to cancel the service, not that I need to give 30 days notice. Very disappointed with the service and, as a student, would rather not pay for internet in a house I am not living in."
Marius,London,6/18/17,"Worst internet ever.
Connection loosing while playing fifa. Loosing points
Called several times to come to fix it and they didn't. We had an engineer scheduled and he didn't show up
Very bad
They incresead the rates after a few months"
John,Edward,6/18/17,Worst customer service! Didn't get the guaranteed minimum speed. Not recommended! In the process of cancelling the service.
Tom,Alfreton,6/18/17,"After seeing the advertisement with Ryan Reynolds getting wifi signal all over his house I thought BT would be good. They are not and on contacting them I was told that the advert was completely inaccurate. So I can not get access in my entire home. Its a small 3 bed detached.
I was told by the engineer to swap to wires in my master hub by removing the front cover. On doing this the insides fell out also.
I called bt as that should not happen as there should be clips holding it in.
BT said they can fix the box at a cost of £250. This was after hours of trying to talk on the online chat where they pass you from person to person and get you know where. Horrible company and I can't wait to be done with them."
Lee Pallister,Higher Davis Farm,6/16/17,
James DF,Cambridgeshire,6/15/17,"I moved to BT infinity from Talk Talk as I was not happy with the service. What a mistake it has turned out to be!
Out of 10 and a half months of the contract BT have only managed to get the minimumum speed for 2 months. The rest of the time it is way bellow the minimum. I have tried phoning and web chats multiple times and no one did anything to improve it. The customer service is useless! Cannot wait to leave. Avoid at all costs!"
James,Banbury,6/15/17,"Had absolutely nothing but trouble registering and setting up my account.
Repeated calls from bt asking me to go through the same steps as before. Must have spent 7 hours on the phone.
Sustained speed and WiFi coverage worse than five year old sky box.
Wish I'd stayed with sky. Even had problems with reward card not arriving after being assured it was sent.
If I could turn the clock back I'd still be using the superior sky service"
Rob Corker,York,6/15/17,
Nathan,Coventry,6/14/17,"Worst internet provider I've ever had. Internet constantly drops.

Had sky before, had problems with their internet. One complaint call and with the push of a button on their end ran smoothly for 5 years straight.

BT won't acknowledge issue or let me leave contract. They state that they can send engineer but if no fault will cost me. All that has changed in last 5 years before getting problems is a switch to BT. I just want to get rid of this awful service and go back to Sky."
Christopher,ROMFORD,6/14/17,Had to phone bt Three times as the broadband was slow very s l o w I mean very s l o w
Mustafa,Birmingham,6/13/17,"I wasn't happy with bt services at all specially with customer service really awful and they are rude,
Speed really slow,
Price not too bad
Thanks God I have only 2 weeks left and my contact will end
My advice to all ( AVOID BT)."
saule,Ashford,6/12/17,the wort internet I ever had. BT cant provide proper services even they say so
Mark,Essex,6/11/17,"I couldn't agree more with all the negative reviews of the BT broadband service. recently installed new customer after leaving Sky with near perfect service (other reasons for leaving). I followed the instructions for maximising wifi signal but was only getting <1mbps. Thought I should leave the router plugged in for 10 days to allow for the line to settle as advised and re-test - it was even worse, literally less than half a mbps. Called BT and was told the service is known to be unreliable and have i considered infinity - AT THE FIRST CALL. I said I used BT's 'chose the right package for me' and unlimited broadband was what was recommended. The agent could see i was getting next to nothing so put me through to the outsourced tech team who were completely useless and after 60mins simply hung up. I called back and was told the problem was solved and the case was closed - couldn't be further from the truth. This went on for a week and spent endless hours on the phone being told to do the same thing over and over again. I had no issues with Sky but was told it must be my wifi devices causing the problem and if an engineer was sent and found this to be the case i would be billed for £129. Nothing has changed since Sky so that cannot be the cause but I declined an engineer due to a complete lack of faith in BT to be honest and not screw me. To put a very long story short apparently BT don't do WiFi and there are no guarantees however with some key phrases, mention of DSR, FOI, Ombudsman and some choice posts to social media i was called back this week and released from the contract. I CANNOT STATE STRONGLY ENOUGH - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS. BT staff are obviously exasperated at the number of calls due to the poor broadband service and that shows in their lack of empathy or drive to put anything right."
Ar vind,Derbyshire,6/10/17,I would give a zero star if I could. Our internet connection has been playing up for 4 months. We've tried 3 BT routers and a third party router. We've had 10 engineer visits. Despite this we have anything between 4 to 14 hours of no internet every day! Now BT case management team have stopped replying to my calls and messages. I rang customer service and suggested that we mutually agree to terminate the contract early as the problem remains and the trust levels have gone down the drain. I was told that I need to pay a cancellation fee as the engineers are still working on it and I refuse to allow them time! They have had four and half months to sort it out. I cannot wait for the contract to end.
vincent,LONDON,6/10/17,
Neil,"Ryde, Isle of Wight",6/9/17,"I switched to BT because they own the copper wire from my home to the Fibre Dist Box thinking one source if any problems arise.

I have had numerous broadband failures, spoken with many BT staff in the UK and India, all of whom has said they would deal with the problem. One outage lasted 6 1/2 days. I was promised on many occasions that someone would phone me back with progress and diagnostic report. They never did.

As a retired engineer I am appalled at BTs abysmal customer support. I would not recommend them."
Aggie,West London,6/9/17,"In my view BT = Prepare-To-Lose-Your-Will-To-Live
Over the years I have had two experiences with BT as a new customer - both of them were ok (apart from the waiting time for the BT engineer). Once the service was up and running I had no reason to contact them.
The annoying part starts when you are moving houses – I am still in process of claiming back call charges for the previous property as BT did not disconnect the line on the date agreed. New tenant made international call which appeared on my bill and now it looks like I have to pay the bill and only after the bill is paid, make another contact with BT to claim it back.
Another issue was when they promised me new BT hub, at first attempt they sent me some sort of plastic connector instead; on second attempt they sent BT hub to an old address; third time after I realised their mistake with the address, they cancelled the previous order and made a new one…..it turned out it was going to go to my old address as well. A fourth time I have lost it, and by the time I called them the hub was already despatched and it was too late to cancel it. During that call an advisor tried to talk me out of reordering hub 6 (the new one) as apparently there is not much difference to hub 5, oh! and that if I was going to go ahead with hub 6 I would have to pay for it. I have informed the person that the hub 6 was offered to me and I never asked for it, but since it was offered to me I got used to an idea of having better hub. After that hub 6 was delivered to my correct address free of charge.
And 2 days after, we realised that BT Sport channels in HD do not work. Our subscription is in place but for some reason it is not being recognised, this happened after house move. So I started a chat with a person, they called me on my phone instead, transferred the call to another adviser who then transferred the call to another team (I think technical). It took 10min to talk to the first two people and I was on hold for the third transfer for almost 1.5h ….no one picked up and I have finally given up."
Lauren handley,Dumfries,6/9/17,"I'm absolutely appalled with BT.. I would never recommend them for anything!! Absolutely shocking service, disgusting customer services.. I phoned to dispute a bill and they hung up on me after arguing with me! Now they have cancelled my account when I didn't want it cancelled. Now charging me almost £700! Absolutely disgusting!!!"
Raj Patel,Orpington,6/8/17,"If you are thinking of joining BT for their TV and phone services let me warn you that you will be wasting your time and money as their service is the pits of any provider in the country and even Talk Talk is a better option.
Lousiest Broadband bandwith - can't even print wirelessly-
Can't receive any advertised channels - HD quality is a joke - exorbitant telephony charges - rubbish customer service with useless remote call centre service - to name a few of the reasons you should steer clear of BT"
Eleanor,southport,6/7/17,"I'm disgusted with BT at the moment my overall satisfaction is making me want to move to a different broadband, as soon as i possibly can. my bill is only supposed to be 43.00 and has gone up to 67.00, however i did go over the time limit on the phone. though this does not amount to the amount of money i have to pay. this has gave me much trouble and instead of my bills being 50.00 they have now gone up to 60.00, im not prepared to pay this amount of money anymore."
david,south london,6/7/17,"pay for up to 76mb get average of 2mb, yes only 2mb that's at different times and days. bt looked into it and stated that i had a ""good"" service!!!!"
Shijumon Joseph,Yeovil,6/6/17,"BT has become a worse provider now a days. My internet has been doped more than a week now. Reported fault and gave an engineer visit appointment after a week. I couldn't go for my work that day. Unfortunately he didn't turn up. Called BT again. They said they have no idea what happened. Booked another appointment after 3 days following Monday. Again I didn't go for work waiting for the engineer. He didn't turn up that day too. Called again BT talked to their manager. He assured next day morning the engineer will visit. Didn't go for work waiting for the engineer. In the morning I called BT to ensure that he is coming or not. He said yes yes before 1 pm. No one came till 1:30. Called again they said it is next tuesday. Imagine, this is 11th days, I have no internet. They have suggested BT Fon, open network which is rubbish. So next appointment gave is for coming Thursday afternoon. Let us see. Dear all, do not choose BT again as they have degraded to lower than talk talk now a days."
Stephanie,Bridgwater,6/6/17,we have Fibre in the village but because we are a mile from that box our internet/broadband is very slow. however we pay the same monthly rental as everyone!
James,Stockport,6/5/17,"We have recently had issues with broadband & so contacted the call centre to report a fault. WORST after sales I have ever encountered. The fault was reported over a week ago to which after a 1hr telephone call they appointed an engineer. He visited 3 days ago unsure why he was there as the 1hr call I had was not enough time to make any notes whatsoever. Still no broadband & no promised returned calls on the further two contacts made. The second contact consisted of a 40 minute call to establish my name & address, & only this! A complete joke!! Will be taking business elsewhere for sure. I hope nobody has to endure this pathetic excuse of a call centre but good luck if you do. Punjabi might be a good language to learn if wanting help with a technical issue."
Zane G,Cheshire,6/2/17,"I have had an absolute shambles with BT to try and get my internet switched from Plusnet to BT. I was given an activation date of 4th May and eventually got connected on 1st June. When I rang on 4th May, apparently my order did not go through to the supplier correctly, they then tried to redo the order and said I would have broadband on 11th May. However, no broadband connection on this date either. After much complaining I was assigned a ""case officer"" who told me system had messed up and only way to get internet was to cancel order and start again. Should be sorted by Monday 15th. Another call on Monday to apologise again but not sorted and they can't give me a date when it will. More complaining and started asking advisor about their ADR and had to be escalated to his manager as was out of depth. i have had to keep phoning for an update because no one bothers to call me. Just been told I have a ""marker"" on my line which will take another 5 days to remove so that my order can be placed again. Order was placed again and i eventually got internet 4 weeks late on 1st June.
BT are a joke, never switch to them. I have seen numerous other similar complaint."
sara,London,6/2/17,
Eby,Dagenham,6/2/17,Really surprised with the quality of service provided by BT Broadband - as a first time customer when i was joining BT - i was promised a lot of things but when it came to delivery - they dropped the penny. Broadband Speed which I receive from BT is less than 1MB per second. When i called up customer care to complain they said the lowest ever speed will be 512Kb per sec. i was better of using a phone line modem to connect to Internet instead of using BT then. Will not recommend BT. I was charged from the time when BT had not even setup the connection and then going through customer care to explain it back to them was another step. So all in all not at all a great experience. Will not want to recommend BT based on my experience.
B,"London, England",5/31/17,"We've been with BT for more than four years now, in the last year our broadband has started to simply stop working at random times. This is not convenient for me as I often have to conduct online meetings with overseas offices from home. It came to the point where I have now moved to EE. However, in the last month of their service, once I had informed them that I would not renew the contract, the broadband simply stopped working for good, with the hub constantly flashing orange. It seems as if BT cut my broadband off before the end of the contract because I had upset them. This means I have had to pay more than £50 for broadband that I didn't receive this month. Beware of BT they will not play by the rules."
Louisa,Swindon,5/30/17,The internet itself is amazing the customer service stinks once you are a customer. Very helpful when you want to sign up but but once you are a customer they don't want to help you.
Charllotte,Manchester,5/29/17,"The bt internet is the worse i ever had i will never recomend it.Every 10 minutes it turns off by itself and you have to wait about an hour for it to start again.When my contract will end i will 100% go look for a better company and trust me the is nothing much worse then bt.The wifi is so slow that i rather walk to starbucks which is about an hour away from my home then wait for my internet to
load.Also the internet is so slow that i invited my granny for a cup of tea however she lives 2 houres away from me gues what she came just before the internet came back on again (shes 83 and she walked to my hause)"
mikef,rural suffolk,5/29/17,still very slow but 8 miles from nearest exchange what else can we do?? Take what we are given I suppose
Adam,Southampton,5/29/17,"I signed because of 100 pounds prepaid MasterCard, which I have never received, when I tried to contact the customer service by email they said that they couldn't help and I need to call to the customer service. So I called, I waited 20 minutes to get to somebody just to be put on hold for another 10 minutes and then picked up by another member of staff that also put me on hold for 10 minutes. I waited 40 minutes to find out that my prepaid mastercard was not claimed and that they send me an email with instructions on how to claim it that I have never received. I am really dissatisfied with their attitude towards customers. Never again."
Parvez,London,5/29/17,"Terrible, switched over to bt from sky hoping for fast and RELIABLE Internet but reliable is not what I have got. My bt hub keeps going into oranger flashing lights at random times, stopping me from watching something other doing my work which is extremely annoying... it's just a pile of rubbish and am getting very annoyed by it... BT need to fix up"
Nalz,North west uk,5/29/17,"Dont get it. The speeds terrible, I cant watch vides on my facebook because its so slow, I cant have more than two tabs open because it makes it too slow to use at all. They've ramped my bill right up to 40 pounds per month and that is not fibre optic! no phone landline used to make calls either so to have to pay that amount for the diabolical speed and service I am getting is completely unacceptable."
ivan,Huntingdon UK,5/29/17,infinity 2 capped by BT at less than their guaranteed speed. Foreign people on chat have no idea and send engineers to check internal wiring when they say it is external fault. Price is 50% dearer than some other providers and as a loyalty offer they want to charge £5 more than I am already paying.
Steve,Newcastle upon tyne,5/27/17,"Previously with talk talk, after having my bank details leaked by them and the shocking customer service I decided to switch to bt fibre.

Called up and ordered, they cancelled my contract with talktalk on my behalf and even paid off the rest of my contract. Engineer visit took almost 2 weeks to come out but apparently I lived in a high workload area which is fair enough.

The speeds I get are brilliant, I get 71mbs with a cable and right now I'm sitting in the garden (3 rooms away) and getting 51mbs wireless speed.

I did have an issue with my phone line and when I called up, they found the issue straight away after a couple tests and sent an engineer to fix it.

I couldn't recommend BT highly enough!

They've been great"
Kelly Grady,Chelmsford,5/27/17,
John Bould,Edinburgh,5/26/17,"It's hard to know where to begin summarising the standard of service I've received from BT recently. It seems like I've been battling their total lack of competence since the dawn of time but I'll try and cast my mind back to what was a much simpler time in order to recount the full sordid story. To begin with I received a bill which charged me an extra £66 for 'excess broadband usage'. I called to query this and was informed by a delightfully self righteous woman that this couldn't be a mistake (I wish I could track her down now to point out the irony of this statement) and that there was no way of removing it from my bill. Not to be off put, I cancelled my standing order and raised a complaint in which I challenged the charge and asked for it to be removed. A week passed, no response. I called and was told somebody would be in touch. Another week passed by, the silence remained but alas my services did not. They were disconnected and ran headlong into the abyss from which they are yet to emerge. Eventually I received a missed call from BT while I was at work but no voicemail with a number to ring back on. The same thing happened the next day and then despite numerous phone calls to the main customer service line on my part I couldn't get through to speak to the complaint handler, who remained as elusive as Ronnie Briggs in the 80s. 2 months into this fiasco I was informed that the complaint had been closed, BT in their infinite wisdom clearly believing that when I stated their customer service was 'worse than being homeless' what I actually meant was 'I am happy for this to be withdrawn without compensation or resumption of services'. I'm sure we can all spot the similarities between the two comments. Finally, a week later, and with my desire for a move to a pre technological village in the Amazon rainforest growing stronger by the minute, BT accepted liability for the mistake and agreed to waive the outstanding balance on my account. Remarkably, the BT customer care machine now went into reverse and having excelled at providing a level of service even the mass murdering General Pinochet would have found disrespectful, they started falling over themselves to make it even worse. First I was told my services had not been disconnected but cancelled outright which meant I would have to be treated as a new customer and would be charged a £40 installation fee on top of waiting a week to be connected. Likening this charge to an assault victim being head butted at his own compensation review meeting I succeeded in having it removed (I stopped short of throwing a celebratory street party). I was then sent a hub. The hub was in fact the wrong kind. I was then sent another hub. The new and improved model did not work. Eager to play my part in resolving this omnishambles I took a day off work in order to wait around for an engineer to come and identify the problem but in a rare moment of oversight on BT's part the appointment couldn't go ahead due to 'insufficient resources and a heavy workload'. in a display of gratitude which touched my weary soul they decided to inform me of this 30 minutes after the 5 hour window for the engineer's arrival had elapsed. And so here we are. I'm now told another appointment can't be scheduled until next week and just so I was in no doubt about my own role in this farce, I've just been reminded by text that if the Internet fault turns out to be the result of the wiring or phone socket in my house then I will owe BT £129 to cover the cost of the, as yet untraceable, engineer. Fair enough I'd say given the way they've nurtured me through this difficult period with the care and attention of a first time mother. I may one day be connected to the internet again. Or maybe by that time the Internet age will have passed us by. Either way, BT are a joke. Avoid them at all costs."
Andy,"Winnipeg Quay,Salford, Manchester",5/25/17,"sometime is good
but normally very slow, very very slow and unstable"
Sam,London,5/25/17,Quite frankly - a very poor overall service with support staff unable to answer the most basic of questions. Fault response - expect 24hour delays even when dealing with business accounts. It's honestly disgraceful how BT can monopolise the internet hardline service with no real comeback on poor service.
Matt,London,5/24/17,I hate the fact that you enter into a 12 month contract with them at a fixed price and they unilaterally decide to increase your bills by 10%. Because you are in a contract with them there is nothing you can do to get out of it other than paying the excessive early cancellation penalties. I can't even cancel after 12 months as they say you need to give them 30 days notice but that if you give it to them before the end of your contract they count this as your cancellation date and charge you for the equipment under early cancellation effectively holding you hostage. Bunch of thieves!
Chris Halliday,London,5/23/17,"AVOID, terrible router. Terrible customer service.

I have a faulty BT Home Hub 4.0. I was persuaded to switch to BT from Sky by a sales person. Sounded great. The reality is different. I was sent a faulty BT Hub 4.0 - the hub they send as standard We can’t connect to it wirelessly for longer than a couple of hours. It disconnects regularly and struggles to reconnect once disconnected. This is when we are sat in the same room as the router.

The internet connection coming into the house is fine, we know this as it was a perfect service when we were with sky and they use the same broadband lines. We know the internet connects with the router it’s the wireless part of the chain that is the issue. The BT router is in exactly the same place as our sky router used to be and we are using the same devices to connect to it. The only variable that could be causing the issue is the router. There are thousands of complaints about fault home hub 4.0 routers online. Wish I’d researched before switching from sky.

After speaking with customer care I was told “We don’t guarantee a wireless service, we are an internet service” which was such a kick in the teeth. Of course I thought I would have wireless when I agreed to switch my internet provider. “Our systems are showing the HUB is not faulty”. Of course from BT’s end everything looks fine as they know that internet is coming into the house and reaching the router. It’s wireless part o the chain which obviously BT can’t test from their office. We are not getting sent a stable wireless signal from our faulty router and we can’t use the service properly as a result.

I asked for a replacement Hub, they said no. “We can’t send out a free router”. Terrible response. I said due to the hub 4.0 complaints.

We are completely unsatisfied. AVOID. Go with Sky always."
Ashley,UK,5/22/17,"THE UPGRADE THAT DOWNGRADED MY BROADBAND.
Upgraded my Broadband from 13MBS to the fastest available in my area 22MBs. When the switch over day came broadband down to 0.2MBs!!!. Engineer came out to check what is wrong. I have been put on an old telephone line that is 11Km long, instead of the 2KM one that went to a local fibre cabinet that I was using before. I rang BT and they say I was always on the 11Km line the engineer has tested your line and there is nothing wrong with it!!!! I could never have achieved the 12MB speeds I said. I told them I had a VDSL line before and now I am switched to a ADSL line. They do not even know what I am talking about. They said what is VDSL?. 5 hours on the phone and am no closer to getting their big mistake fixed. Wish I had not bothered trying to get an upgrade."
Phil,Fareham,5/20/17,"I've just changed my broadband fibre package from talktalk to BT Infinity & TV. The change over was on the 17/05/2017, BT kept me informed as to when the Hub ect. would arrive, & that my landline phone would be disconnected for a while until they reconnected it.
I set the infinity Hub & youview up myself & when I turned them on we were up & running, so I connected my smart TVs & computers & everything is working perfectly. So far I'm well impressed."
Avoid BT,Wales,5/20/17,
Billy Boy,Antrim,5/20/17,"Renewed 12-month contract with BT to maintain the discount. They said everything would be the same except I could expect slightly faster broadband. When the new contract started the Broadband stopped working and I am left with a flashing DSL LED. Called their help desk and was told I needed to wait 48 hours before the service would start working and they were going to do nothing in those 48 hours to help. Children were off school for study leave had to take them to the local library so they could study. I work from home and had to sit in my car at a local car park and use my phone as a hotspot so I could work as the 3G is useless where I live. After 48 hours still no broadband. Called the help desk (it sounded like a call centre in India) they said I needed to stay on the phone while they tested the line. During the test the line went dead and I was left with only the dial tone, they did not call be back. After hours of waiting I called again and explained what happened. They looked at the notes and said I had put the phone down on the support parson during the test so that’s why they did not call back! They then started querying how I had my name spelling on the account name saying that is not how my name should be spelled. They also had my house number wrong in the system they were now using they had everything correct except they had the wrong house number. This support person was extremely rude to me (it sounded like a call centre in India) They tested the line and said it was fine I must have done something to stop it from working. They were unable to help and were even describing the hub and open reach modem incorrectly telling me there were not the ports on it I was seeing. They said they would send out an engineer to have a look. The following day I looked online when I was using my phone as a hotspot and on the BT site, the fault said it was fixed. I called them again and was told to stop calling them! they were dealing with it!!. I called them the following day to confirm an engineer was coming as their website said there was a fault and when I clicked on the link it said the fault was fixed, they had a look and said they could not see any appointment for an engineer. I asked them were they sure. I told them when the engineer was supposed to be coming and they then said they could now see the appointment. So far no broadband or engineer. I have spent countless hours waiting it queues as their automated system says we are extremely bust at the moment. The children have to keep going to the library to use broadband as their homework’s are posted on Show My Homework website. I cannot do my work properly I need to keep going out in my car to find a good 3G/4G hotspot. I told BT I worked from home but they are doing nothing at all to help me! I would advise everyone to avoid BT at all costs they are a nightmare to deal with."
Jason,Romford,5/19/17,We mostly see negative remarks against BT. I have never had a problem with the service received. I especially enjoyed the service received from an agent called Alden who called me regarding the BT Cloud Voice Service for my business. He did have a slightly foreign accent but good nevertheless. Keep it up guys.......
Asad,Glasgow,5/18/17,"BT
Receiveing a very poor service
I ordered phone line and broadband with BT and
BT OutReach installed services yesterday but have no broadband.
After 6 hours on the phone i have been given an other 48 to 72 hours to fix.
Very bad service"
Ali,London,5/17/17,"BT unable to complete my order, been waiting over a month.
BT claim they initially made the wrong order and failed to inform me the order was cancelled. Only found out of the issue after calling BT to ask when will the engineer arrive, they claimed they never put it through even though they sent me email confirmation of the order and when engineer will arrive to set up the box.

Later they claim they need to re order the package and will receive a call from one of the advisor confirming if it's completed. got a call to say it's now complete and will be ready next day. This went on for 4 days after which BT claim the advisors did not take correct steps as there are issues with Open Reach. So now been told I have to sit tight and wait until someone gets back to me. Absolutely speechless and so frustrating, this is the second time it's happened to me. First time I waited 6 weeks so eventually decided to go with a different provider, this time I don't have any choice as it seems BT are the only providers for Fibre."
Daren,Cardigan,5/17/17,"Absolutely terrible service and the customer service is laughable,actually while trying to reduce package got cut off on 4 seperate attempts so decided on the 5th to end with there shambolic service"
douglas hathaway,aberdare,5/16/17,"I moved from talk talk to bt at the end of my contract as there was a good offer. I have only been with bt 13 days and spent more phone time with them than i did with talk talk in 18 months. First they are denying the offers of £150, then my broad band speed is below 1 and when i try to cancel the contract they are saying that the 14 days grace are from the order date not when the equipment is installed. This does not make sense as surely one must have the 14 days trial from the installation date"
Paul,Pontefracr,5/16/17,"It took us 6 plus months to get broadband then in Feb 6 months later would you believe a price rise stocking service when we called asking why every month or bill was different they said it's because of your phone use well I almost wet myself as we never use the phone now the operator is stuck for word's and says she will get someone to call us asap guess what ..... that's right no
MY ADVICE IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
dave,caerphilly,5/15/17,"Awful internet service.
freezes all the time. It makes watching programs take twice as long constant freezing day in day out. Havent had any problems with any other providers

according to them they are the best."
Joseph,Leeds,5/14/17,"They add extra charges here and there and didn't inform me that after my contract ended I would need to pay an additional £31 for them to disconnect the line.
The advisor tried to trick me into staying with them as a new remnant is moving into my flat. What they failed to mention is if the remnant doesn't go with them I will need to pay the £31 disconnection fee plus an additional £40.99 month broadband and line rental.

Overall a bunch of thieves go with Virgin or Sky. (Even talktalk are better)"
Helen Clark,SHROPSHIRE,5/14/17,Was going to move to sky for free unlimited broadband deal. BT then offered a similar deal so I stayed put (better the devil you know than the devil you don't). Ever since my broadband has been wholly unreliable. A real issue as I work from home quite a lot. Rang up to complain. Apparently no problem with line but a dodgy hub. New hub arrived - low and behold exactly the same problem. Call me synical but free unlimited broadband seems to mean you have to fight it out with everybody else for the service - I've been a Bt customer since 1995 but clearly loyalty means jack! Unless it improves I will be moving at the end of the year!!
Imran,Birmingham,5/13/17,"Switched to BT from TalkTalk via USWITCH on 11/04/2017, was meant to have my broadband and phone up and running by 28/04/2017 but only my phone was working. Contacted BT and they sent out a replacement router, still had the same problem. Then an engineer was booked but they failed to attend, i had to take a day of work and waited from 8am - 1pm. Contacted them again and they couldnt say why the engineer never turned up then rebooked my apintment. Same thing happened again and all i could get in response was we had a technical glitch. At this point i had been without broadband for 2 weeks and i am a uni student so i do need the internet and was having to run around using other peoples WiFi so at this point i wanted to cancel my services but the adviser advised me not to and that they will compensate me etc and that is should try resolving this matter and that they will book another engineers visit and make sure that its is fixed. This time the engineer turned up and fixed my broadband - (11/05/2017) So i contacted BT in regards to not receiving my BT reward card (£175) and they said its not showing on your account so we assume you're not eligible. I had a order confirmation stating i should receive a Master card of £175. All in all its the worst company ever i have been tied down to a contract which will cost over £400 to get out of. If you experience any problem make sure you dont listen to the companies nonsense and cancel your services. They're a bunch of liers and will do whatever to not pay out. I missed 2 days of work, thats £90 out of my pocket, but they dont give a damn. 1 star dont do justice, -100 more like. Would not recommend to an enemy."
Brian rhodes,,5/12/17,"This is the worst company I have ever dealt with, don't bother SIMPLE."
Andrew,Aberdeen,5/12/17,Very expensive
David,Fraserburgh,5/11/17,"I have spent countless hours over the last 2 weeks on the phone and the BT chat line as my broadband keeps dropping out.
Despite an open reach engineer visiting my house and saying that the problem is at BT's end i have been met with nothing but waffle.
I am now switching supplier as i have nothing to lose."
Richard,Edinburgh,5/11/17,"WOW! Twice now I have entered new contracts with BT and never will I do it again. First I set up one for my mother in her home and was left without internet for 4 weeks because twice the customer service advisors managed to put us on the wrong deal and then cancelled the orders all together rather than setting up new ones.

Then stupidly for my own flat I ordered BT thinking I'd be safe enough if I ordered it online. Engineer was booked for the day I moved into the flat. Received a text two days before saying an engineer wasn't necessary but low and behold it was and it took 2 weeks to sort out that. Then we moved flat within our 12 month period so transfer our account to our new address. 2 months later still no properly working internet will work for about 8 hours a day on and off and is really slow when it does work.. BT have offered a refund of £1.92 as they say that's all they can see of our internet not working. I've sat all night and watched my hub turn into some sort of disco light with all the colours you could imagine as the internet isn't working. We've had 4 engineers appointments one failed to turn up and therefore was a waste of my half a days wages to wait in and 3 haven't managed to fix the problem. Tried to get out the contract however they said when they run tests it's above the 4mbs speed that is the minimum. Even though the engineer said we weren't getting that and I've numerous screenshots of it when we ever do get a connection the highest being 2.13 mbs. Do customer services care? Can't say they do because the problem still isn't fixed! Ridiculous!"
Anonymous,London,5/11/17,"Worst internet provider ever! Slow and unreliable internet (even though we have optic fibre)!!! awful, rude and useless customer service, telling us for two years that there are some technical issues in our area and everytime they give us different timeframes to when these will be completed. If I could rate it with 0 stars I would!! Overall satisfaction NONE!!!!"
Jane,Edinburgh,5/11/17,Horrendous. Did not connect to a nexus tablet and basically said it's tough there is no other option. Very poor can't leave a 0 star so 1 it is I am appalled. Avoid at all costs

Tony,Waterlooville,5/11/17,The single worst company I have ever dealt with. Constant issues very slow communication just terrible. I've been stuck with them for 30 years as I cannot get an alternative service due to my location. I hate BT so much.
Medy D'avino,London,5/10/17,
Amy,Waterlooville,5/9/17,"I am absolutely disgusted with the service we've had from BT, the lack of communication between its staff and the service itself! I asked for my account to be cancelled in January as i was moving and they are still charging me now despite me leaving the property and cancelling the line! I've just had to pay a £100 bill to close the account. I would not recommend BT to anyone for either its broadband service which took over 9 weeks for them to start or the customer service you get on the end of th phone! Absolutely terrible!"
john southworth,ludlow,5/9/17,E mail Gavin Patterson CEO and explain the problem and you will very soon have an executive complaints handler to deal with one on one.....simple!
Olivia Swan,Larne,5/8/17,"Had the old BT home hub which was absolutely fine then they talked us into getting a free smart hub! Is the slowest wifi i have ever experienced cant even watch a programme on bbc iplayer since we got it!! An ""upgrade"" they said!!"
B.R.Bayley,AIRDRIE,5/8/17,Very poor service. Plenty of process and talk but little progress in a rural location.Finally quit BT and moved to 4g. Good riddance.
May,Inverness-shire,5/7/17,BT has improved over the past year. The speed has gone up from 0.5 mbps to about 5 mbps. Speaking to their call centre has greatly improved as they have moved from Mumbai to the UK and the operators are much more helpful. But they have made us pay for it. We now pay 4 times as much as last year for still very slow speed.
Jamie,Nuneaton,5/7/17,"Internet iservice fine but it is ruined by the the rip off price increase, 2 months into my contract they put my bill up from £12 to £14.88, quite an increase! They said I could leave but they won't be refunding me my installation fee or fee I paid for the router. Companies should not be allowed to operate like this, it is a lose, lose situation for customers, I had already paid out over £200 upfront for line rental too. Did not expect this from such a big company especially 2 months after I join a contract. Go with a smaller company which has to treat it's customers properly"

David,Fraserburgh,5/6/17,"A pathetic service, keeps dropping out and despite an open reach engineer visiting and saying that the problem is at the BT end they insist it isn't.
Customer service is mixed with some agents trying to help but others simply cut you off or passing you on to other people. Over all for the cost i would say BT are rubbish. I certainly would not recommend them to any one.Even as i write this it's dropping out."
Edwards,Astley Shropshire,5/5/17,"Promised delivery before Christmas but delayed til January.Waited in for three days for engineer to connect. As it happened I didn'tneed to grr :( as it was fixed at theit end. Customer service id abroad and there are communication difficulties.
Intermittent disconnects.
Pretty cheesed off with a price hike about two months after being connected and to find that I am part of fon"
RH,Leamington Spa,5/5/17,"At the extortionate cost of £62 per month I am looking to change provider from BT to another. Although BT has been responsive to any issues, making improvements within a matter of days and being quick to answer the phone (comparatively), I am optimistic that this service can be available at a lower cost - my energy bills have certainly improved since moving away from the ""big 6""."
Kris,Aberdeen,5/3/17,"Worst broadband company ever! Will never recommend. It hurts me to give them 1 stars each section, in order to write this comment. Either wise i would have left it at a minus. Ridiculous charges. Ridiculous customer service- we had problems with our network connection and I was put on hold for over an hour and then I had to speak to someone completely different. Apparently, there is a 30 pound cancellation fee, so they kinda squeeze the money out of you until the last second. Also, my flatmate (who has his name on the contract) got charged 75 pounds today ( monthly charge + cancellation) after BEING TOLD BY BT the money will come off end of this month. So, to sum up, not only is the service non-responsive, but also too expensive, and because they are so great and overcharged my flatmate, they got him into problems with his bank card. Thank you BT, but no thank you! Give a favour to the world and stop existing!"
AJ,blandford forum,5/3/17,"Been using BT since dial-up days.Cannot recall any occasion where I've been annoyed by an interruption in service.

Complacent but happy I guess."
jessica,north london,5/2/17,"I had a contract, but they always send people 2,3 month and tell you they have better offer which just play tricks. Actually it won't be cheaper but you have a new long term contract. once I decided to move and try to cancel it, I been told have to pay the rest long term money £600 even I am not going to use it. It is cheating, the lady offered told me i could cancel whenever one month advance. very bad service! offered me hotspot but even now i haven't got correct login detail, offered speedy broadband but always no signal and need restart! The bill even themselves can't make it right! waste my time to call, every call i have to spend a half day for waiting! so please don't trust them! very disappointment."
Luke Dearing,Bury,5/2/17,"Terrible from start to finish. We switched from Sky which was a huge mistake.

They did not keep several promises about our start date meaning no internet for weeks.

They stopped my service after 2 months, I called them and was told I had cancelled it (I hadn't). I then had to restart my contract from month 1 and my price immediately went up, I complained and got £10 back (it took several phone calls explaining the same thing to different people).

The Internet has cut out several times over the year for several hours, I never called BT to complain as the customer services are terrible having to tell three people your problem.

Finally ended the contract this week, was happy to pay up a penalty fee to leave as I was so fed up with them as they put our prices up massively meaning Sky is far cheaper again.

Please avoid using BT..I don't usually moan either!"
Eimas,London,5/2/17,Worst customer service. Give fake promises then try to charge you extra for their mistakes. Overall very bad employers mess up the name of the company
Angela,Conwy,5/2/17,"Poor in all areas.

BT don't make it easy to get support - all well and good having internet help but when the internet is at fault it's pointless. A telephone appointment made for 6pm saw me rush home to be here - none came and eventually I gave up waiting and at 7. 20 pm I went outside to do some jobs . They called at 7.30 pm and didn't try again and didn't leave a message. I missed them by 3 minutes. Not impressed."
Daisy,Plymouth,5/2/17,If I could rate 0 I would faulty equipment which was set t he incorrect address. Took months to sort out slow co connection.

june,rochdale,5/1/17,after signing up with bt they took £59.99 from my bank I then cancelled the following day as I was being given a better deal with my current provider it took bt 8 weeks to pay back the money only after I informed them I was taking the matter further after my experience with bt I would never consider going with them there customer service was a joke
James,Bonnyrigg,5/1/17,"Don't get half of the download speed I paid for as in I pay for 73MBPS and I get 20MBPS, Internet connection cuts out frequently has useless customer support the only reason why I even have them is because I have no choice as other ISPs don't even have fibre optic in my area!!!"
John Conway,Northern Ireland,4/28/17,"I live in the heart of the Irish countryside and my current wifi is very poor. It is very slow and is limited so it gets slower and slower. Recently we have been looking to BT to get reliable and fast broadband, but in our area (Glenariffe) it is 2mb a second.2!! So we are stuck with very slow wifi which costs nearly £100 a month. Please fix this we are spending a fortune on wifi."
Keith copley,Cuxwold,4/28/17,Good speed for our area. Just keeps dropping out every day without fail. Absolute rubbish bt not bothered or interested in helping. They just keep running checks on the line and telling me it's all sorted out. And it is until the next day! Utter rubbish
Roby,Hockley,4/27/17,"Worst company I have ever dealt with, they lied about the price and since then I have had nothing but issues, cannot wait to leave them."
Danish,Slough,4/26/17,"BT have gotta be thr biggest shamballs out there. No internet for the past 3ina 1/2 weeks. Ring one person they slam you with one story. Ring another and somehow theres another yet completely different story.
BT is rubbish. Absolutely rubbish! You dont get anything they give you with their package. My hub has been flashing orange all day. If there was a way of shutting the company down and getting to declare admistriation i would so help out. Biggest scam of the century. I have no shame in writing what i am writing. I would not recommend them to anyone. As far as the fibre optic goes. There aint any. Its all a scam. All they want is the money from the customers. Thats all. Absolute disgrace."
Joe,Surrey,4/26/17,Why pay for the most reliable and quickest broadband when it doesn't work? Completely cuts out with only 1 device using it! STAY AWAY THIS BROADBAND WILL CAUSE YOU MORE HASSLE THAN ITS WORTH!!! FIND A DIFFERENT PROVIDER!!!
Louis,London,4/25/17,"Ok so his is the first time I have ever posted a review but I thought it entirely necessary as BT are that utterly disgraceful and have been the biggest name of my life for the last month.
As a milenial I prett ygood with this stuff. Ordered my new router 12 mo th package online, dinged up to bt mobile, got free bt sports- all good.
Service supposed to start on 5th April- voicemail received on 3rd April (which has no callback number) informing me that due to area broadband will start on 24th April...
Numerous call, complaints etc and dealing with kids on the phone, it becomes apparent they cannot do anything about this.
In the meantime... my new bt sim arrives and is not compatible with iPhone. As I have no wifi this is a difficult issue to solve! Eventually by sim is working in iPhone and number is ported 10 days after intended time due to BT incompetence.
The 24th April arrives... no BT broadband is activated and still not working. I would love to call customer service, but the Bt sim I have signed up for has no phone signal in xone 2 London- are we dealing with cave men?
Customer service for broadband is an automated voicemail asking you to go online to find help.
In my ling 27 years of living BT is probably the worst decision I ever made in my life- please do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs"
Jim,Glasgow,4/23/17,
john s,ludlow shropshire,4/23/17,Everything bad previously said is true. The only way is to e-mail the Chief Exec Gavin Patterson and you will be contacted by an Executive complaints handler who will then be your dedicated contact and point of reference. He will(should) be able to move things apace. Except when he gets your broadband onto Fast Fibre but your speed falls from 1.5mbs to 0.5 mbs !!! To far from closest 'BOX' Ah well.
Dorothy Murray,Dartford,4/21/17,Do you really want one? Diabolical. I am now on my 2nd infinity hub. I player took 48 minutes to play 28 on BBC. Wish I had changed. Nothing good to say. Just want my money back and soon.
Matthew Budd,Stoke Gifford / Bristol,4/21/17,"BT ARE ABSOLUTE RUBBISH !!!!!

DONT SWITCH TO THEM !!!!

I was contacted by BT who convinced me to change back to they're services saying that my poor internet speeds etc was due to sky being a bad provider. Yet since I've been with these absolute fools I have had approximately 2 weeks of internet and phone line in the 5 months I've been with them.

They have provided me with ENGINEERS THAT DONT TURN UP !! And excuses that do t wash.

DONT DO IT PLEASE STAY WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER !!!!"

Jacqui Wade,Leeds,4/16/17,"Appalling speeds, rarely matches the guaranteed minimum. Wi-Fi struggles with 2 metres, often with Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections showing as 'unstable'.

Kris,Glasgow,4/15/17,"Worst broadband provider I've ever had the misfortune to deal with - do not switch to BT at any cost. BT couldn't set my line up correctly, took them two weeks. Their customer service is abysmal, prepare to get bounced around multiple call centres being lied to, customer service agents continually contradict each other and you have to repeat your problem to a half dozen people before you find someone who can help. Broadband speed is shocking, my BT Infinity is slower than my standard Sky speeds, the router frequently resets itself, usually during the middle of a film. My TV box is also broken so I cannot receive paid-for channels, today I was promised a call back with a resolution. After 6 hours of waiting I called them back myself only to be told an engineer would need to come out but I would need to wait a week for this and it would also cost me £130 if they could not find the fault (essentially blaming me, the customer). Bunch of absolute cowboys, I expected so much more from BT."
Karolina,Kirkcudbright,4/15/17,"I have been a BT customer for over 5 years, recently when I wanted to move to another network provider, there has been lots and lots of issues with BT mainly because they wanted to keep me as a customer. I have received a charge from BT of £550 as a result of me moving to another provider, when I have received this notice, I decided to phone BT and after a chat with an agent I decided that I no longer wanted to move to another provider as a result of the charges. Therefore the BT agent was meant to put what is called a slam on the line but that never happened, the new network provider had no evidence of this happening. Thankfully I have now managed to win this case and move to the other provider with no charges at all. That just shows that it is always worth to fight for your own , no matter how stressful it can become."
Prakash,Wembley,4/15/17,"Just been informed by BT's Mark that they don't guarantee BT wifi in your own home... really shocking. Every now and then BT wifi get disconnected.
No help available from BT.Another individual can't differentiate between account number and land line number. What kind of service can u imagine ?"
Mark Shackleford,Grange Park Swindon,4/15/17,No issues it has rarely if ever gone down and speeds of up to 40 meg
Nick,Orkney,4/14/17,"Like many rural users BT doesn't really want to know about our problems. Faults take far too long to get fixed, if they ever do and there seems to be no urgency to address the problem of abysmally slow speeds."
Margaret,Scotland,4/14/17,I am very happy with my broadband from BT. I have never had any trouble at all and I have been with them for 7 and a half years now!
Keith,Herefordshire,4/14/17,"Min speed of 64meg and I live in a village not a town. Very impressed with customer contact centre help (UK, India and I think Phillipnes). One Openreach engineer visit who resolved all my internal wiring problems. Line speed went up from 29megs and is rock solid at 64megs two months later."
Dave,West yorkshire,4/14/17,I pay for fibre optic broadband and receive speeds too low to download films from Netflix. Supposedly I get up to 44Mbps which should be plenty. Have had numerous calls to BT who either don't believe me or just don't care. Speed goes up and down like the proverbial yoyo.
Unhappy,Hampshire,4/14/17,"How does bt even exist!!
Signed up about four weeks ago..
Broadband and telephone working ok even though they sent me two routers....
Waited an extra few days for tbe tv box but did not appear...
I then made call after call to bt to find out where the item was only to find that tbey had cancelled it without even telling me...USELESS!!
Then again after several calls bouncing from one advisor in the uk to several overseas advisors who had may aswell spoken in german....told me they would cancel down the subscribtion and start over...
After afew more days the unit came...i have spent over fours ours this morning speaking to technical teams that speak some other language to me and have now told me that i have to wait another four days before they can fix it...
You can guess what i did after that...
Yep....cancelled everything!!
Please pleass do NOT sign up to bt....Their customer service is exactly as bad as everybody says...Virgin Media and BT are most definatly the worst ever providers..sky following close behind...."
Joan McAuley,Leven,4/14/17,"I've been repeatedly lied to by BT staff over the past ten days. Internet keeps dropping and is extremely slow. Had four so called engineers out in the last few months to try to fix the problem, but still not working reliably. Took a day off work to stay in for engineer, and told he would be there between 08.00-13.00. called them at 12.00 as had not received the usual text of call to say they were en route to be told the appointment had been cancelled and made for Thursday, although I had told them that was not suitable. Promised return calls were never received. Got home on Thursday to find a card put through the door saying he had called round anyway!!! Many calls to them and many Livechats later, speaking to at least twenty people and having to explain the issue many times, I was finally told they would come out on Saturday the 18th to fix the issue. Checked my diary after ending the call to see that the 18th is Tuesday. Another call to be told he could not find the promised appointment. Another live chat today to be told they are booked to come out on Sunday the 16th. I'm not confident the promised appointment will be kept, and if not, I'm going to have to cancel the service and do without an internet service altogether, as no service is better than an extremely poor service. Too stressful to deal with, and staff with a very poor grasp of English, and would NEVER recommend BT."
Dan,Bristol,4/14/17,"I entered into an agreement with BT many,many years ago and the last time I looked (a couple of years ago) I was paying around 15-ish pounds plus line rental, so it was probably costing around £25 pm.

My loyalty has been rewarded by BT by unilaterally racking up my monthly charges up to £47.

For that I get 0.5mb (I did you not) download speeds, mediocre service, regular breakdowns and a number of 'services' I never use.

for £47 I can get broadband, a decent TV package, line rental, free SIM card and cash back so goodbye BT.

Congratulations- your subterfuge, greed and disingenuity has led me to cancel my agreement with BT and move to a competitor.

I do not expect the customer service will be any better, but at least I can either halve the charges or benefit from some major benefits such as, for example, a TV box and/or movie package."
Anita,Tiverton,4/13/17,
Kmb,Cardiff,4/13/17,Bt tv new set up. Who thought this new way of using bt tv was better. It's rubbish. You can't see information as it's put up over last program watched. It's defiantly !!!! Not easy to use. Having done survey regarding all aspects of bt tv I think it's taken a backwards step.
Nick,Birmingham,4/12/17,"What an awful experience, moved to a new build with BT as the only provider. I had no choice to switch from Virgin super fast broadband and great customer service to over 6 weeks wait for a phone line and cancelled broadband orders. I have such low expectations I am waiting another 3 weeks before complaining again. Never go for BT"
Georgios Papatheodorou,Essex,4/12/17,"I've been with BT since December 2012. It took them 7 whole months to finally spot and fix the problem with a brand new line. Crackling noises in the voice line, intermittent disconnection in the internet line.

Since 2013 I had to move house twice and obviously had to transfer the service. The whole transition was just a nightmare with the customer service being the worst by far in the planet!

Lately, I requested the existing line to be transferred from my wife's name to mine. They treated that as a new account, had to cancel the existing services, reactivate them under my name. How stupid that is?

And on top of that, they gave me a new phone number; they never have told me that is was part of the procedure (although it was supposed to be just an account holder change) and had to request renumbering after the new phone line activation. That task is supposed to have been completed within 24 hours. 9 days later and 4 live chats with CS, renumbering has not been completed yet.

Conclusively, the service from the technical side of view, once set up correctly by their side, it works fine. But that could take ages with a customer support like this!!!"
John M,Banwell,4/11/17,"I can't believe this company exists, totally incompetent of communication both between departments and with the customer. Ordered broadband and BT Youview to a property that already had a phone line in place and 8 phone calls, empty promises, missed deadlines and over five weeks later they had the cheek to send a bill - UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!
Finally gave up and anyone will be better that BT - a cheek to hold the title ""British"" when all you get is Indian Customer Services."
Megan,Exeter,4/11/17,Nothing but issues! BT have cancelled and re-issued my landline & broadband order 9 times in 6 weeks and it's still not working! Numerous conflicting texts & calls from BT who are no help - I certainly don't recommend them and will never use them again!!
Dee,South East London,4/11/17,"I wish I'd read these reviews before switching. We've had the contract 8 months now and the internet has never worked properly. It cuts out at least 10 times a day, it just drops out for no reason. It's meant I can't rely on working at home, we can't watch netflix in the evening, or anything internet related. I've called repeatedly and been told unhelpful tips (like that the only way they can guarantee a good connection is if we plug into an ethernet cable. In 2017 you're telling me you can't provide WIFI???????? ), or have said they've fixed it when they haven't.

We will definitely be switching as soon as our contract is up. Never go with these guys."
MV,Buckinghamshire,4/10/17,"BT is the worst internet provider by far. The speed is very poor, price is astronomical, customer service is non-existent. I repeatedly asked for unlimited broadband which was not put into place resulting in huge bills. Do not use BT. It is a complete rip off & they over-charge unsuspecting customers. They had agreed to compensate me for over-charging me but I did not receive the refund and then they said they would not honour the agreement. Good old British Telecom!"
Fed-up Mike,South Wales,4/10/17,"Just had to renew contract with BT. My old bt 3 hub is giving trouble . BT agree it is faulty, it works for a while then just goes dead. Reboot and its ok for a while. Bt won't change it saying it is out of warranty although they still accept full payment each month. So I must enter a new contract. Where I live the only other gang are those that can""t speak decent English, not even their sales team. So I'm stuck with BT !
After much time spent on the Phone a new package was agreed, confirmed twice verbally, even confirmed it was being recorded, then confirmed by email and low and behold Bt had changed the deal. Back on the phone. No I can't have that deal, it was wrong what the salesman told me, It now costs £8.99 more. BT claim they can back out of their agreement in the first 14 days. Like I said I'm stuck with them. Won't send another Hub lest I go through all those hours of convincing them it faulty after my new contract starts tomorrow.
At least they speak English even if it is with ""forked tongue"""
ON,South London,4/10/17,"I Cannot believe how bad this company is. I came to this country not knwoing much about the competition but speaking to BT, they gave me all the possible good vibes about using them and i signed up with them. in my first year, I was horrified and terrified by the bills and their AWFUL AND DIABOLICAL customer service. every single call that I have made to this company was over an hour, wasting my time and at the end of the call, you feel brain dead because the customer service people twist their words and statements so much. I would recommend NOT TO USE THEM WHAT SO EVER. i can go ON AND ON about them but I can't be bothered to waste any more of my time and Google's space for reviews."
Chris H,Ipswich IP8,4/10/17,"Abysmal. ""Service"" provided a week late and then the speeds are appalling. These people are clueless."
Tristan,Cheltenham,4/8/17,"Broadband regularly drops out on both streaming tv channels and internet browsing.
Repeatedly talked to BT and nothing is different.
Will pay more and go to Sky next time around.
Pathetic service for 2017, like BT is stuck in 2000.
Inconsistent customer services.
Inconsistent sales team and my service is worse since going through the renewal process."
Cary Kemp,Lee on the Solent,4/7/17,"Poor wifi connection. Horrendous customer service. Unable to get out of contract, although I've only have 10 days service, as Ive been told countless times today that its 14 days from when you sign up and not from when the service started 10 days later"
Craig G,La13,4/6/17,"broadband good fast speed etc, TV nothing but problems, keep losing channels and can't retune normal TV eg itv2. Switched from Sky big mistake on my behalf, will be going back January 2018. Only had Bt TV 3 months and had more problems with it than in that time than 20yrs with sky. I'm sure Bt have plenty of satisfied customers but sorry not me."

and today teopping conection every minute"
Darren Clisham,Morecambe,4/4/17,"Below I have listed all the points and issues that have arisen since the 29/11/2016.
• Phone call made to BT on the 29/11/17 to explain we needed to move our business
• I was passed to 3 different departments in which I had to explain in full each time
• I was told someone would be in touch regarding the order (BTAARP061-1)...this didn’t happen
• I made various call again having to explain what I needed, I was told the wrong service and equipment had been ordered but a project manager would contact me to handle the full move
• Mr X from the business movers service team phoned and told me he had been assigned to look after the move and also comply with the “best practice steps 1-5” (if you need it I have an email listing the steps
• The first thing he did was cancel the previous order as it was all wrong, I had an email on the 08/12/16 confirming this had been cancelled, the new provisionally appointed work to be carried out date was 19/12/16.
• I was told someone from BT cloud phone would be in touch to progress with the order
• MR Y emailed me and I quote “I have now been informed that the order that sales had placed for BT cloud phone was incorrect and should have been for another BT product, cloud voice” as you can imagine alarm bells had started. “ I do apologise on behalf of the company for these problems, but trust that this will now be resolved by sales in conjunction with the BT movers team and the Cloud voice team”
• I never heard from MR Y again
• I received an email on the 09/12/16 from MR X stating order BTAARP06 was now complete and hoped I was happy with the service? This order had been cancelled and was never completed.
• A new project manager had now taken over MR Z, he contacted me over the phone and said he had arranged for MISS D to meet Myself and the other director onsite to start the full order process again as it was proving impossible to arrange over the phone
• On the 12/12/16 MISS D attended our new property at 13.30pm
• We explained the shambles that had happened previous and stressed the point over and over again that we needed someone to take full charge of the order and arrange everything without us having to make constant calls and do all the chasing, our business depended on it
• MISS D told myself and my partner that we didn’t have anything to worry about, she would arrange everything and the process would be very smooth, our full system could take up to a max of 60-90 days however she would arrange a temporary solution that would enable us to move into the new premises early January 2017. She also expressed her apologies for the way the move had been dealt with to date.
• In MISS D proposal email I quote the following paragraph “I would like to highlight the strengths BT has to offer you. We have involved in the installation and commissioning of similar projects for many years and have an unmatched record of professionalism. Our local engineering team will endeavour to complete your installation with minimum inconvenience, as we understand the need for continuity in business
• If this paragraph had been adhered to I would not be writing this complaint
• Engineer booked for 19th of Dec, ORDER NUMBER xxxxxxxx
• Email on the 18th Dec stating work to order number above had been completed-work had not even started
• Engineer cancelled on the 19th rebooked for the 23rd of Dec
• Our works Christmas function was due to take place on the 22nd of Dec 60 miles away from my office
• I didn’t attend Christmas function so I was able to meet the engineer the following morning
• Engineer arrived on the 23rd and said he wasn’t sure what the job was he was supposed to be doing, I tried contacting MISS D but to no avail, he contacted his department who then confirmed the job couldn’t be done as the line was coming from the wrong exchange, engineer left and said job would be rebooked.
• I was then sent a fine of £130 plus VAT because apparently I didn’t meet the engineer on the 23rd of Dec
• Work was then booked for the 9th of Jan, when I called to confirm this I was told the case was unassigned and no engineer was booked in, I was also told I was waiting on a call from another project manager
• The new project manager was MISS L who I explained everything to and also sent the conversations that had taken place with MISS D, Again I was assured everything would be taken care of and I had nothing to worry about
• At this point various text messages had been sent to MISS D with no reply, I have attached the messages as proof
• Engineer arrived on Tuesday the 10th of Jan, exactly the same thing happened. Wrong exchange and no one could explain what was going on. Again the job had to be rebooked with open reach, open reach blamed BT and vice versa.
• I have emails from MISS L assuring me open reach had sorted the issue with the exchange and 100% the engineer will be able to install the temp line on the next visit
• Engineer booked for the 13th, this was then cancelled by either BT or open reach and re scheduled for Monday the 16th
• GUESS WHAT?.....wrong exchange again! We have a voice recording of exactly what the engineer said and admitted the job was a complete mess! Please let me know if you wish me to send this to you.
• At this point MISS D had not been in touch
• Engineer booked in again for the 19th of Jan, finally after 4 attempts the temp line was installed
• Another project manager then called me stating she was taking over to assure things ran smoothly from this point on her name was MISS P....I explained everything again in full and reduced myself to tears on the phone pleading with her to make sure it happens, she stating she was going to look into everything for me and call me in 2 days time to update me on the full project, she couldn’t have been more sincere. Is this something BT do as part of their training? A course in how to become a pathological liar?
• I never heard from MISS P again.............
• I asked MISS L to contact MISS P for me and ask her to get in touch, nothing ever came of this
• Engineer booked for the 20th of Jan to install the broad band I have an email from MISS L stating the engineer will visit between 13.00-18.00pm, I cleared my diary and waited at the office from 13.00 – 1600pm, I contacted MISS L as I would have usually had a call or email from open reach confirming the job. MISS L told me the work had been already completed offsite at 10.30am that morning. When I said I have been waiting all day her response was “it’s not uncommon for customers not to be informed” so this was yet another business day wasted waiting around for BT
• 24 January the case was moved across to MR M, I had a phone call with him and MISS D was in the background so she could hear the conversation, he again apologised for the issues we had faced so far. He listed points of the project for the next stages.
• PSTN installation for the 25/01 was booked in as we had received email confirmation = MR M said he could not find that on the system but would look into it. The installation didn’t happen on the 25th but 2 weeks after this date.
• Project Manager to the lease line order was MR J = the only person other than MR M who has kept to his promises
• MR J sent the equipment for the system i.e phones and switch
• Engineer booked to come and install the equipment 16th of Feb, engineers words “sorry love I’m snookered I can’t do this job” it turns out vital equipment was missing of original order the firewall and sisco router. Engineer spoke to MISS D on the phone and explained the problem, MISS D said she would look into it
• MR J contacted me and said we could install the phones ourselves if we wanted to take the risk without the firewall, because we were running out of time we agreed and spent the rest of the day doing the job the engineer didn’t
• I spoke to MR M ref to the equipment that had been missed and yet again delayed the job by a further week, he arranged for MISS D and his IT man to come to my office and install the firewall and we wouldn’t be charged
• The sisco router was sent by post to us and an engineer was arranged to come and fit it on the 10th of Feb
• The company who came to do the CAT 5 cables arrived on the 9th of Feb, the man who came stated he couldn’t do the job as BT had only put the job down as 1 man when actually it should have been a 2 man job, I literally had to beg and thankfully he did the job and completed it on the 10th of Feb
• Engineer arrived on the 10th to fit the sisco router and stated the cabinet that was ordered was to small and it wouldn’t fit inside so it is currently on the floor. Please see attached photo evidence of the system and the way it has been installed and left
• I have requested the correct cabinet but I am still waiting on the outcome
• Our phone system is still not running correctly and one of the cloud phones doesn’t work at all, we are waiting on a replacement to be sent
• We are now 101 days in since I first contacted BT to move my business and we are still not 100% up and running
There is more that could be added to this complaint but because I am unsure of dates I haven’t included them, however I can assure you hours of valuable time have been spent on the phone achieving absolutely nothing and going round in circles. I have been running a sales business for 8 years and I have never come across anything like this, the incompetence of the sales staff is astounding and frankly if they worked for me and treated my valuable customers in the same way they wouldn’t last 5 minutes.
As you can see, your company has let Mobility Connect LTD down in every way imaginable. It has caused unbelievable stress on the business at a time when we should be enjoying the growth of the company and moving to new premises, instead we are stressing over BT’S incompetence. 1 STAR IS VERY GENEROUS!!!!!!"
Vee,Norwich,4/3/17,"I've been with BT for years but have only recently taken over paying the bill. I got a fairly decent deal last year and the service was reliable to after some too-ing and fro-ing between them and Virgin, I decided to stay put as I rely heavily in the internet to work from home and I didn't want my internet to be restricted.

So they offered my an ok deal for Infinity 1 - more than I had but as I couldn't previously watch films on normal broadband, thought it might be worth the upgrade. So.... the internet is Worse, Cuts out or just drops off at least once a week. Wifi sometimes default to the free public BT-Fon internet as that signal is actually Stronger. Complained once and the guy said he would reset/clear something or other and it got a little better, but now I do a speed check once every few weeks and its nothing like I was promised.

To top it all off I have noticed on my bill that they are taking £60 a month from my account instead of the £30 on my contract. And to reduce that £30 even more I paid £205 line rental upfront. So not only did they take the upfront line rental - which meant I should only be paying about £13.50 a month now they are taking £60 a month. That's a monthly overcharge of £45. They are taking more money than I have authorised and are also double charging me. I feel robbed and definitely wont trust BT again. BEWARE!"
Graham,Bridgwater,4/3/17,"The broadband is so slow it can take hours to download anything as at times it looses its connection.
It looses connection on speed tests. Im living on a new housing development and yet most of it cannot even get a decent broadband speed, it seems that BT do not care about their customers, they seem more interested in how much profit they can make."
Rich 3,East Midlands,4/2/17,"Only company I know of that believes it is accepfable to tell you that you won't be charged a call out fee on 3 separate occasions, and then charge it to your bill anway and take it fom your account without your authority. Staff who lie and are apparently trained not to listen to reason and who have not an ounce of client centricity in their bones. A shambolic organisation that it's Chairman and CEO should be ashamed of (but who I suspect are more interested in their over inflated financial incentives than any of their customer experiences). Avoid at all costs unless you want a coronary trying to get back your hard earned cash that they have taken from your account without authority."
Terry,Southend,4/1/17,"Worst ever been with talk talk, and sky a lot better, then BT keep losing signal, worst customer service ever was off for 3 days and received £2.95 compensation, and you get nowhere with their customer services like talking to a brick wall, and also but prices up after 3 months, which I don't think should be allow whilst in contact, AVOID"
Antanas,Colchester,4/1/17,Rubish...
Alex,London,3/31/17,I have been with bt for years but very dissapointed the way i was treated. Very poor customer service with rude unhelpfull advisors. Switched to another operator now. Very dissapointing bt!!
ben,,3/30/17,never purchase bt because you never get the speeds you pay for. I pay for 70 down which is the best package. If im lucky I will only get 5 down which is shocking
keith heard,eccles on sea,3/29/17,"I have an absolutly abysmal broadband speed of around 0.4 to 0.7 mb, and often even less. I often stare at a blank screen that wont even load up a page.I am paying good money for a rubbish service to BT, who could not care less. I have complained about this without any improvements whatsoever."
Richard Larter,Barnsley,3/29/17,"Avoid BT like the plague,worst customer service i have come accross in almost 50 years,rubbish product,rubbish company,don't touch with a bargepole."
peter,swanmore Hampshire,3/28/17,"BT signed me up for 55 MBPS. and charged me for that rate, in fact I Only Achieve 18MBPS download and 2.3 mbps upload.
So basically being charged for speed I am Not getting. But BT come up with excuses I am to far away from the exchange. Though they never told me that when I signed UP."
Joe,Guildford,3/28/17,"Stay away!! I can't overstate how terrible this company is.
Huge lead times on getting setup.
Random increases in monthly costs.
Shocking customer service (once you finally get through to someone)
And as for trying to leave... book out a week of your life to speak with the entire callcentre."
Disgruntled BT customer 1394,Derby,3/27/17,"Where do I start:
Customer service? What customer service, the advisors don't seem to care about my issue I must of called 8 times in a week each time they put me on hold, test my phone line and say my phone line is fine EVIDENTLY it is not as the router flashes orange in would seem 24/7. Got an engineer to come out they fixed it then it just crashed again and same problems started. They then sent me a new router and the same issues continued.
It is of utmost certainty that you mustn't choose BT and instead choose Sky or Virgin as they provide a far superior broadband to the rubbish I am currently receiving.

Thank you BT for absolutely nothing."
Sian,Upminster,3/27/17,I never review companies but have made an exception for BT after a 5 week long battle and 36 phonecards I manged to achieve an Internet connection for 10 days before they tried to charge me £118 for my trouble!! I attempted to leave them and was told I would have to pay £200!!! Then they disconnected me for refusing to pay a bill so high for 10 days service. I rang and argued it and had an extension agreed to April to allow time to contest such a high bill. Just come home and found out they have disconnected me again. They refuse to put you through to a manager. They've promise to escalate my case to a special team then I end up back in the loop of customer services who have no authority to help!!!! Never had such terrible service. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! I've taken to the time to review so no other poor person has to suffer such an inadequate rubbish service!!!!!
Luke Russell-Smith,Horsham,3/27/17,"WORST COMPANY IN EXISTENCE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Can't communicate or deal with custom efficiently, takes forever to get through for a service that is shoddy at the best of times for mega expense DISGUSTED"
Annie,Banstead,3/26/17,
Kevin,Willesden Green,3/25/17,"I have had BT for over a year now and i have continuously had problems with internet speeds. Your internet is possibly the worst i have ever experienced. I Find it unacceptable that i am living in London (one of the technologically advanced cities in the world) and i have the same internet speeds as children in Africa. I find it ridiculous that i am paying over 60 pounds a month as a student and i am unable to load a 7 second Facebook video. Your service is probably one of the worst i have ever seen and i recommend people looking for internet providers to seriously consider not paying for your horrible service. Btw I recommend you to provide the option of 0 stars on your ratings above.


Kind regards,
Kevin"
Okezie,Solihull,3/23/17,"There are few words in english that would sufficiently capture the incompetence of BT customer and technical service.

I ordered broadband a month ago. That it hasn't arrived obviously is not news. But the reasons customer service have given could not be made up. From bandwidth to red light to mismatch between BT and service team to previous user (new build!). It wouldn't have surprised me to hear that a snake was found in the neighbourhood and so no broadband.

So was told to expect a call (before 9pm!!) today that would solve all problems. I've been sat at home since. I called at 8am, 2pm and a few minutes to 9pm. No call. In fact the night team finally suggested to wait for that call 5 days hence!! I have never been so frustrated.

Why would there be such universal opprobrium against a service? And why is that service still in business? BT has a monopoly of the market and this MUST STOP."
Carol Lee,Red Lodge,3/23/17,"I have had BT service for over three years and have been tirelessly disappointed!
Only recently did I finally get broadband service which has allowed me to view movies and online videos at a decent rate. However, my internet WITHOUT FAIL turns off and on 2-3 times daily. It's extremely inconvenient as it disconnects me from my work and family.
BT is the only available service in my area, naturally, or I would certainly be choosing another provider. For what I pay each month, I expect more reliable service!"
Anne,Banstead,3/22/17,"Absolutely awful!!!! Don't go there...,poor customer service...
Stick with sky or virgin, even talk talk beats BT"
Anniesharkey69,Banstead,3/22/17,"Absolutely awful, poor customer service!! Wished I'd never changed service provider. Will be cancelling and going back to sky!!"
Singh,Thornton cleveleys,3/22/17,PLEASE DONT Ever use bt or move to bt their fiber broadband is the worst ever broadband I had in my life speed is awful and it doesn't connect called customer support they sent me an engineer charged me £250 problem is still the same use any providers but not BT Thanks
Andrew,Derbyshire,3/22/17,"PLEASE NOTE: Do not change your service to BT; they have provided the worst service I have received in 40 years of being a home owner.

The transfer from Sky to BT took much longer to achieve and was not conducted on the promised dates. My house was left with no landline for over a week; at that time I was working away from home and this caused stress and upset to my family and me.

BT have now increased their prices and I have missed the cut off date to cancel my contract and move back to Sky. This has resulted in a cancellation fee of £181.71.

Please choose another provider."
Ron Ling,Worcestershire,3/21/17,"BT must rate as the most useless company in the U.K. Service - rubbish, customer service - painfull. Eight days to get a simple modem problem resolved with littl or no help from their customer services"
John hanlon,Glasgow,3/21/17,"Absolute terrible company where most of the staff hang up on you after spending an age getting through.

Will most definately be my last contract with them and will make sure all family members do the same"
Susan,"Worthing, UK",3/21/17,"I have recently tried to move from BT, as we have new providers in the area. Their contract terms are impossible - exit fees are outrageous. Even after they increased their prices and gave us 30 days to exit without penalty they changed the exit period so I would have had to move same day or face over £350 penalties.

The customer service agent didn't care and told me 'we're not the cheapest and we don't price match' - this can only be said by a company who have you cornered or provide a level of service that's exceptional and worth the extra. BT's service isn't all that!"
Katherine jackson,Newport,3/20/17,"I changed my parental controls a months ago on my iPad without issue. Ive been trying to adjust them but when i click on 'manage extras' the next page is completely blank. After a call to BT and then a call back from the 'parental controls' dept, they cant explain why and say i need to be logged into a PC while on the call to them, i dont have a pc. They didnt have an alternative scenario, i have to get infront of a PC and call them back. Ridiculous."
Ivano,Sittingbourne,3/20/17,"Had issues since day one, even with placing the order. To receive the gift card included in the offer I had to call every day for 4 months.
Decided to cancel because they decide to increase the price for the second time in a year. BT tried to convince me to stay offering me to pay more (???).
A week before the end of the contract the quality of the line dropped drastically."
Nick,Rotherham,3/18/17,"I'd like to place on record that BT are useless. Moved house recently and decided to stick with BT. They cancelled services at old house 3 days too early. Taken nearly 2 weeks to activate BT services at new house. In the meanwhile they sent two BT smarthubs to new house. On activation day line wasn't activated. Phone BT call centre in India to report issue. On hold for half an hour and got transferred to another department and then cut off. Phoned again in the morning to report fault and they booked an openreach engineer to come this morning. Openreach engineer called me to ask where am I and I said at home. Found out that they've sent the engineer to the old house! Can't reschedule for today so cancelled BT altogether. Luckily Virgin provide in my area so going with them. Stay away from BT if you want to avoid frustration, poor customer service and belligerent attitudes."
Becky Swan,Plymouth,3/17/17,Absolute waste of time and money. I have been charged for a service I did not receive and find it impossible to get through to anybody who knows what they are doing. AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS
Richy,"Summerhill, Wrexham",3/17/17,"I have been monitoring my broadband speed daily and am constantly. Receiving only 1.22 Mbps most evenings. Despite paying for a 76Mbps service. Why are we the customer having to put up with this the so called providers are taking our money and not delivering, THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE."
Westcountry worker,Glastonbury,3/17/17,"Trying to switch CON. Once you have contacted your new provider, details are sent from that new provider to BT, but BT send you letters, texts and emails to say you have not cancelled all services and you will continue to be charged by BT for the services. Yet you know you have ordered all new services. So you call BT, they then try to sale you a new deal. You also are supposedly unable to cancel the services yourself over the phone, and they tell you your new provider is the only one that can do that. And so on in a loop of never knowing why BT are not getting the full cancellation from the new provider.
Dishonest conduct, using the prospect of charges to make you call, then to talk you into continuing to buy their services, and you were never actually able to make a diference from the call anyway.
Shame on you BT, trying to steal money whilst hiding behind your contracts of small print somewhere."
Miro,Tower Hamlets,3/16/17,
S Intrepid,London,3/16/17,"Do not use BT. I am now with V*** pay less and get brilliant broadband. Bt never worked. Every time I complained they persuaded me I just wasn't paying for enough. Despite having assured me it would cover all my identified needs at the point of agreement. So I went up several times. I have been with them for 5 miserable years. Intermittent internet, never ever enough bandwidth, I could never watch Netfix or Amazon long enough to catch a whole film or episode. They charged through the nose, huge charges for something or other- my bill was always a lot higher than agreed- for overuse charges. I only sometimes had the chance to ak what was going on as it would always take hours. Finally I switched and NOW THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO PAY £31 CANCELLATION FEE even though this is not a new contract. Keep well away."
Kevin Edge,West Yorkshire,3/14/17,"Had their full BT system in for 2 weeks and still unable to watch ALL the channels, even after TWO engineers have been out.
The latest engineer told me my plug filters had not been cynked in.
Now their engineer department are telling me I have to go buy a booster plug.
DO NOT USE BT!"
Thomas weir,,3/14/17,Absolutely terrible !! staff are so rude. Hung up on me when they took out over 100 pound of my bank without a reason!
Ahmad Bangash,"Tooting, London",3/12/17,"Rude, terrible customer service. I took contact of phone line and Internet back in April 2016 and today I call them that i am moving house and my contract is expiring on 11th April so I don't want to renew another 12 months contract and when I move to new house I will decide at that time about the service provider. They told me that I need to pay £31.00 to shut down the broadband, at the time of contract nothing was mention to me that there will be £31.00 charge at the end of contract to shut down the contact. They told me that it is in the terms and conditions, they should tell every customer that this is the charge you need to pay at the end of contract. I will never ever use BT services in future and will not recommend to any family and friends."
Jazmine,Norfolk,3/12/17,"The wifi is terrible, it's so slow and goes off every 10 minutes. To be honest wouldn't recommend BT wifi or broadband as it's rubbish"
MR JOHN COLE,NORTH EAST BEDFORDSHIRE,3/12/17,"Up to 4 Jan 2107, Broadband Download speed for my cluster of neighbours was dropped to below 0.512 Mbps, which does not qualify as Broadband anyway. It has been between 0.32 and 0.47 Mbps since. I have had an OFCOM monitoring box (SamKnows)on my BBHub since September 2016. BT want user to use their BT-controlled 'Wholesale' tester, which I do not advise as they control it. Use an independent speed check and keep screenshot records. The only device attached to my BT Hub is the OFCOM/SamKnows box: this is important as they try to dismiss their inadequate service delivery as too many WiFi devices attached to the Hub. Help/Support staff seem to have very poor technical knowledge, just try to convince you that it is all your fault and are reluctant to send out an engineer. Use their CHAT means to make a complaint as this keeps a transcript of your Dialogue. Ensure that you use the Word Complaint, not Problem, if they are dropping your service speed."
Ant,Mid Wales,3/12/17,£40 a month for top speed of 0.2 m think I'll go back to sending letters as Royal mail is quicker than my broadband.
Ceri williams,Stafford,3/10/17,"Shocking service! The worst customer service! Past from pillar to post, left with no phone line for 3weeks and each time given a different excuse!"
Fahim Razzak,London,3/9/17,"The worst service I have ever had both in terms of customer service and broadband. Their staff are rude with total disregard to customer service and lack even basic customer service skills. Stay clear of this company. I had the broadband service installed in Jan 2013 and it never worked properly even for one day. Frustrated with their incompetence and total disregard, I switched to Sky in Aug 2013 and have been happy with broadband ever since. BT on the other hand, instead of apologising and refunding the bills that i paid for the services i never received, they are chasing me for terminating the contract early. Pathetic, absolute disgrace they are - stay well clear - be warned!"
AshleyH,Isle of Wight,3/8/17,"Unbelievably contemptuous company that could not give one stuff about its customers. Just joined them and immediately had a price hike. Yes I can leave but what a way to do business.
How can Ofcom allow this company to trade when they openly brag that ""We can change any prices and terms during your contract""???? Totally unfair contract term. Absolutely disgusting way to treat customers one month into their contract."
Mr will,York,3/8/17,Very bad bt just not care unhelpful on the phone. 6 hours on the phone. Stay well clear if you can ! Very bad service. They have the monopoly on phone line !
Robert,Cardinham,3/8/17,"Useless support, MY Broadband along with telephoen has not been working for a week. An engineer wroked out thata cable was broken 210 metres from my property but closed teh job as ""fixed"", When I chased apparently Bt have been calling me on my landline - yes the one that is not working to discuss the fault and I am now told that they can not fix the problem because there is a problem in their data base with my address - even though an engineer has already made the diagnosis.. What a complete and utter waste of time"
Jon,Dorking,3/8/17,"Its a shame there is no option to give zero stars to BT.

What an utterly awful company to deal with!

No internet for over 2 weeks now and every time I call its the same pointless process over and over again.

They send engineers who never turn up, try to charge me for their failures and waste hours of my day every time I deal with them.

Please do yourselves a favour and DO NOT USE BT for anything"
Dan,Brentwood,3/7/17,"This is the worst Broadband / Tv package deal I have ever owned. I have lived all over essex ( also in the wild wilderness) and received a must faster, reliable and pain free service. Please do not be fooled by the cheap price of a package deal. Save your money and use carrier pigeon, even an untraine done from leicester square as you will have more chance of that working than what BT are installing. Honestly the product / service / customer care / attitude towards a bad service is absolutely terrible."
Mia,London,3/7/17,"I would NEVER recommend BT. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

I have been dealing with a complaint from the moment I was mis-sold and misinformed at point of sale.


This complaint has been running for 4 month with having over 20 conversations with different people to then be told that I has been LIED to and to resolve the issue was give a poor £2 discount on my rate and a refund. I was then told that the discount no longer applied as the BT rates are going up (which proves that they have no customer loyalty) and that the refund that was MEANT to be credited to my future payments was also a lie. Every single word that has come from BT has been a lie and still now trying to resolve.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
Daniel Franchini,Hackney,3/7/17,
Dina,Colindale,3/6/17,"Worse experience with broadband ever!!!! 3month waiting for connection line. Promised conection date moved again. Very long wait for engineer visit.If had been given a choice would not had them as my provider, but its the only provider at my post code."
Kathryn k,Southampton,3/5/17,"Absolutely Abhorrent service, broadband cuts out repeatedly, customer service are rude and unhelpful and have no idea what they're doing. You get passed from pillar to post. Don't do it."
Simsy,Manchester,3/5/17,"No Problems with the broadband.
Changed the terms 3 months in to contract upping the price.(annoying but they can do that) I invoked cancellation they cancelled it for the wrong date. apparently to cancel the cancellation it takes 24 hours. Sounds dumb and i have to call back to re -cancel. Sounds really dumb from a big firm like Bt."
Tristan,Peterborough,3/5/17,"Having been a (overcharged against the market) customer of BT for 20 plus years, my 73 yr old mother has been told it is £30 to leave their broadband and phone service. And absolute disgrace, not in the terms and conditions when she joined, and pathetically explained as one part of BT has to charge another part of BT to disconnect at the exchange. This is effectively restrictive practice. An awful company that treats customers like numbers, not human beings. Avoid them at all costs. Not surprising that ofcom are forcing them to drop line rental prices, they will rip people off for as long as they can without legislation."
Emma Brown,Mansfield,3/4/17,"I am absolutely disgusted with the customer service at BT. 1 hour 4 minutes on the phone transferred to 5 different people to be told despite being within my 30 day cancellation period due to price increase, that it doesn't stand as I have to give 30 days notice or transfer to another provider before the 30 days are up!! Which for me, according to the rather patronising customer service advisor, goes from the date of the email received on 8th Feb!! Apparantly I am tied in to a 24 month contract which still has another 11 months to run. I can honestly say I would have never agreed to this length contract as I am well aware deals change quickly along with better prices!! The customer service advisor within the cancellation team (5th person I got transferred to!) came across as patronising and in the 18 years I've had a phone service I can honestly say I've never been more disgusted. Roll on 11 months or the complaint being resolved so I can move to a provider that offers good customer service and values its customers. I would never use BT or recommend them as a provider again."
Monty,Glanvilles Wootton,3/3/17,Terrible service. terrible speeds. no plans to improve speeds in our area. 1/5*
Ryan Edwards,Liverpool,3/3/17,"After leaving sky who have been very good for 7 years I decided to join bt for a change, 15 days later from my turn on broadband date I still have no internet. When I call about 4 times daily they say we cannot get a engineer out for another 2 weeks. Never ever again please do not join bt it is the worst customer service I have ever experienced"
Kiran,Derby,3/2/17,"Bt is an absolute disgrace. They are dishonest and ripping people off. Our bills each month since June 2016 have been increasing. Last month they charged us £145 even though we had just moved into our new home and only had access to the internet for 2 weeks. Were a working couple with a toddler so not much time to be online when home. However, there have continually said we're going over. When I called them after they took the money they eventually said they made a mistake and would reimburse us £88 but we only got back £60 approx. This week we got a letter from them saying we can choose a new deal or had the option to leave. So we called them and they tried to tell us we can't leave until we told them they sent us a letter. Our mistake was not looking at all the reviews online before agreeing to go ahead with bt. We won't make that mistake again."
kfoto,Norwich,3/2/17,"I have been with BT for 7.5 years, 3 years with fibre. I am currently paying £36.63 for up to 38Mps, but actually get around 48Mps. Very occasionally there is a moment's break on the broadband, maybe just twice a month. When I was having a recurrent problem loosing connection it was quickly remedied by the supply of a new router FOC. Overall I am very satisfied with the service."
Jurijs,northampton,3/2/17,"customer service is so rubbish, conecting from one department to another. phone cut and no 1 didnt called back. completelly unrespectible company 12m contract finish and never come back ! rubbish"
J. Ark,London,3/2/17,"Since people realised by now how bad BT' customers service & Broadband is, BT reinvented itself as Plusnet, which is as bad. The legal team is not able to show any existing clauses but will fight you on everything to scam you. In addition, when you choose to leave, Plusnet will not take your written notice but illegally charge you for an extra-month without any Services rendered. Plusnet will help themselves with your direct debit whilst providing the worst of broadband and landline services for the duration of the contract. If you complain, Plusnet ask for additional money to fix any issues (and not fixe them in any case...). Good luck!!"
Chris Cowley,Dartford,3/1/17,BT have dealt with me dishonestly. I contacted them for broadband fibre. They wrote a new 18 month contract and at the same time they changed my telephone package removing my original friends and weekend option. My account went from £64 to £227 in one month..now apparently it is my fault for not checking that they changed the calls without my knowledge. They are grossly dishonest and do not keep any records or record the reference numbers logged when you query them. They leave anything off that reflects badly on them. Disgustingly greedy without any concern for the customer...greedy money grabbers!!! Do not use them...never...ever!!!
andrew,london,3/1/17,"honestly. if you want internet slower than 56k moden then join Bt, they are seriously bad. i have no idea how they have lasted this long. painfully slow internet, nonstop disconnecting."
andrew,london,2/28/17,i'd rather jump off a bridge to my death then commend someone to use BT or Plus net. honestly the worst internet provider to have ever lived. just bad. Connection completely stops working and disconnects you every min after peak hours. you guys are an actual joke.
David,Kent,2/27/17,"I will say the broadband I have is as advertised, it's up to 52mbps and I get 50 and it's pretty reliable, might go down 2/3 times a week for a minute or so. It's always on so to speak, fast downloads and the router has been okay, but very poor wireless, it doesn't even go to the bedroom which is on the same floor as the router and roughly 5 meters away.

As a company they are awful, they put up their prices during your contract and you have to put up with it or cancel early and pay the rest off.
I started with infinity 1 and lane line, it was about £35 a month, 8 months later and it's now £50-£55 a month for no reason.

I asked them why it happened and they said all customers have to pay more in order for bt to spend more on the network maintenance and upgrades! They then tell me as I've contacted them, magically they can reduce my bill by £10 a month, what they didn't tell me is that buy agreeing to that I was entering a new contract so my 12 month contract is more like 18 months now and I'm still stuck with them for another 10 weeks!

I can get the same £50 a month service for a £25/£30 else where and will be doing so.

They all give you ""free"" stuff like BT Sport which later is not free, rather than cancel it for you they just add £5 a month to your bill. Here you go sir have this free tv package, it's £5 a month! It's like going to a pound shop and asking how much is this?

Scammers."
Phil Smith,Derby,2/27/17,"I got stuck with BT as I was moving city (and house) so got caught in there ever renewing contract (to avoid cancellation charges).

They messed up the connection on every move, in one instance trying to disconnect our new neighbours. The complaints department is beyond a joke, at one point demanding I close the complaint because it had reached their self appointed time to deal with it, which they hadn't done.

Finally they've tried to charge us £80.00 for cancelling the contract after they put their prices up, in direct breach of the ofcom regulation stating otherwise."
Joe,Belfast,2/27/17,"Customer service is absolutely atrocious! It has just taken me almost an hour to change from an extremely inflated monthly payment to a bill for each month. The guy in the call centre just didn't seem to understand what I wanted even though the previous call handler and I explained clearly what had to be done.
Going now for a lie down and a cuppa"
Silvie,London,2/24/17,"For the sake of your own sanity, DON'T JOIN them!!!!!! We joined 6th January only to receive a call one week later that they are cancelling our order and apparently we requested it. Called them back to find out we have to wait a week for another engineer who then said it will not work for additional 10 days!!! 10 days later nothing. Called them again telling them we want to cancel the contract. We've been told to wait another 3 days for a call from their complaint team to sort it out. Hours on the phone with India for nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and join someone else who actually cares about their customers.."
Nikolas Demetriou,London,2/24/17,We were promised a 3-7.5 mbps for our broadband i am preety sure we have never reached that since we moved here. You definetely can't rely on this broadband + i tried to reach them through phone a couple of times which they never answered(both times i stayed on the line for more than 10 minutes.
Simon McNally,Portadown,2/24/17,"PLEASE AVOID BT!!!
I recently moved house and planned on moving my broadband package too, BT cancelled and lost my order on several occasions. They kept putting installation dates back. I feel completely messed about. Their customer service team is woeful, no harm to their Asian team but they haven't a clue and can't understand English, it took 30mins on one occasion just to confirm who I was!! Seriously avoid BT, they have no respect for customers."
Suzanne,Newcastle,2/24/17,"DO NOT SIGN UP TO BT!! THEY ARE THE WORST COMPANY WITH HORRENDOUS CUSTOMERS SERVICE!

Signed up everything in March 2016, they lost the order which all bank details were given so didn't start until June! Broadband was terrible! Constantly dropping out! Every call went to an Indian contact centre and lasted around 4 hours! Made a complaint which took 4 months to resolve and the resolution was they couldn't resolve the bad Internet but would continue to charge top price every month. Finally I heard from Sky that due to price rises in April I was allowed to leave early. I rang and cancelled in a shot and went back with Skype who I was with 15 years, had fantastic service but BT claimed to have faster Internet."
Clarke,Hartlepool,2/23/17,Renewed my broadband TV and phone package after a 12 month discount package and overjoyed to be offered the same package for a further 18 months. Free phone calls 24/7 - full BT sports package and even sent the latest hub. Well informed about the small price increase-great service A1 all round*****.
xanthos clerides,London,2/23/17,"Broadband speed: rarely reaches speed exceeding 5mbps.
Customer service: no answer. called 2 times and after 15 minutes I decided to hang up.
Broadband reliability: Not only the speed does not reach the figures promised, it is not even stable."
Aiste,Wattstown,2/22/17,"Cheaters, liars, DONT EVER SIGN THE CONTRACT WITH THEM!!! Prices increases service going down! Complete rubbish"
Jonathan,Leicester,2/22/17,"BT are absolute trash, toilet paper, clowns, rubbish and thieves! Constant price hikes, poor customer service, (no disrespect to the asians as it is not their fault english is not their first language). Connection speed is good cant complain between 50-65mb on an estimated upto 75 mb package.
I was originally paying £45 per month for a 12 month contract, which went up to £55 within the 12 month period. After the 12 month contract period I as vex and wanted to go with someone else, yet BT convinced me to stay as they would reduce my bill to £33 if i took on another 12 month contract. This I did but guess what? Yep within just 2 short months price went up to £42, then £44 to now it £55. STAY WAY CLEAR OF BT you have been warned."
Cian,Lancashire,2/22/17,"Chose BT as my first internet provider when i moved into my first house, and the entire experience has been terrible.

It took BT three weeks, with three separate engineers to set up the service. When I rang up customer service, I had to go through around 15 minutes of an automated phone call requesting every single possible detail before i was finally put through to a person (who was then only reading from a script, with no knowledge of the product anyway).

Then when i moved house six months later, I was charged £130 to switch my broadband to my new address (which was a two week wait, for someone to come and plug a device into my wall, and then leave).

Upon leaving BT, i receive an e-mail which states that i need to pay £20.38 for ending my contract early, even though it ended last month. I apparently also need to pay £31 for stopping my broadband. Obviously when i try to ring BT to sort this out, i am greeted with automated nonsense.

I am glad to see the end of my time with BT, and would advise everybody to stay away from a company which offers no customer service, and sends you extra charges for anything they can think of."
Alan,Eastleigh,2/21/17,"Usual story, shocking customer service. Recently rejoined BT after many years away and replaced Sky for phone, broadband and TV. Broadband usually ok but drops out for no reason making the TV unviewable. Have missed numerous shows that I like to record on Discovery and Nat Geographic channels. Seems to be every few days I have to go through rebooting everything to get it working, only to see the connections lost within minutes. Have had an engineer out to no avail and given a very long cable to hardwire the set top box to the router - an unacceptable solution as far as im concerned. Wish I had never binned Sky, particularly for BT who have demonstrated exactly why when I can finally extricate myself from their contract wont be seeing me as a customer again. Ever."
Richard,Surrey,2/20/17,Never Use BT....Service is appalling and Internet/Broadband is terribly slow and constantly drops. Worst decision I made transferring to BT..cant wait for the contract to end so I can move back to a decent provider...never had any problems before I changed to BT
Barbara Thomas,Barnsley,2/20/17,"I wanted to put minus one for overall satisfaction and customer service ,but it isnt available.
At present i,m in the middle of a nightmare with BT ,I decided to leave because of the price hikes ,thats when the trauma began , letters , texts, and emails ensued, 5 in a week ,3 calls to disconnections and customer care , getting no further ,cancelled direct debit
so I can control what they are asking for
I have tried to cancel sport 6 times over the last few months,
3in the last 18 days ,no one does it , wrote a letter to managing director customer care ,block capital across the top I AM NOT PAYING £110 fee for early release of contract and CANCEL SPORT.
This morning letter from the Libby Barr ,manager, thanking me for my order of BT Sport!!!rang again, now. they tell me another account was opened. In my name,I didnt open it , so who did? They dont know , theres only me so ,its not at my end.They say i,ll get a bill in the next 7-10 days saying what I owe them , then I,LL have to ring billing to sort it out -customer care???
Incompetence ,rudeness ,agression, confusion, and being pressured is what I,ve had from BT ,DONT even think about joining them
I might of thought about rejoining in the future , but I,d rather be without services now
BT ARE A JOKE !"
Arthur,London,2/18/17,"First week of switching from sky to BT i regret that ive done it so much, service was on for 4 days and then it cut off, contacted technical of BT 4 days ill have to be without broadband and land line, even though switch over date was 4 days ago. Would not recommend them. Unfortunately virgin is not available in our area."
silvian nicorci,London,2/18/17,"Just cancelled my broadband and found that I have to pay £31 disconnection fee, disgusting. BT never mentioned this fee when I moved to then. I am sure they never mention this as customers will be put away. It is a disgrace to charge something like this at the end of the contract.Shame on them.Will never use them again."
rwb,Telford,2/18/17,"It ought to be illegal to describe 2BMit as ""broadband""."
Edion,Dagenham,2/17/17,"the worse service I ever received.
I got charged for over 1 year for a contract that I cancelled. £44.99 a month for 13 months I kept paying even though I was told that the contract is cancelled and that I don't need to do anything. I urge everyone to stay away from BT. the service was very slow and was charged over £600 for a service that I clearly cancelled."
Seb,Nottingham,2/17/17,"Absolutely shocking. I'm on Infinity 56meg, rarely ever see those speeds. Furthermore, we live in a 2 bed terraced house and signal drops in and out if we're further away from the router.

The customer service is useless, you'll be waiting for an hour just to speak to someone who doesn't have a clue what they're talking about.

They also throttle speeds (whether they'll admit it or not). At 5.02pm every day, the speed will drop through the floor and remain shaky for the whole evening.

We're lucky that they've just tried to increase prices mid-contract (I don't know how that's an acceptable way to do business), this means we're allowed to break contract and move to another supplier.

If you're thinking of moving to BT, don't. We were on Sky before which was reasonable but that was just standard broadband. Everyone that we've spoken to on Virgin Fibre has said it's fantastic. Pay a little extra and avoid the issues we've had."
Anoob Saban,"Ashford , Kent",2/16/17,"Joining the club of BT frustrated customer .!!!
Nothing to add to the other reviews . I am so shocked how a British company like BT Trap the customers , being rude to the customers and hang up the phone for a mistake done by BT.I have forwarded the complaint along with these reviews to Ombudsman Communications .
Libby Bar , be proud of your worst customer service team , I bet they are following their leader ."
S Kazmi,Birmingham,2/16/17,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

I am their present customer and they are the worst.

Just moved house and was told that internet connection will be there from 10th Feb 2017 at new address. Around 9th Feb internet connection was disconnected around midnight from old address so that a new connection can be put up on 10th Feb at new address.

Whole day of 10th Feb 2017 there was no connection. Nothing on 11th either and when on 12th Feb I contcated BT then I was told that there was a technical glitch. When I asked that if there was any glitch then why wasn't I informed....BT representative had no answer to it.

I asked them to get me the internet connection by Monday ie 13th Feb 2017 anyhow and I was told that it's not possible because there is another company called Open Reach who are going to do it and we dont know when.

Today is 16th Feb 2017 at 2:00 pm and still there is no sign of my internet connection although I am talking everyday to their customer representatives. Best part is that they assure you that you will get it but they don't know when.

Me and my husband work from home and it has been a big blow to us monetarily and has been very very stressful.

AVOID BT PLEASE."
Jon,Brierley Hill,2/15/17,"By far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with! DO NOT USE!!
I took out a contract with them for my broadband and TV. All was good, and then I needed to leave my property, and move back to my parents house. I was, of course, not able to take my service with me. All of the equipment was paid upfront by me as well. I called BT to let them know and to cancel my contract, to which I was told that I needed to pay the rest for the contract?! This was a further 9 months! My argument was that I was receiving no service from them as I was no longer going to be at the property, and i was not able to take with me. They said that when I took the contract out I should have known, to which my comment was I cannot see the future. Apparently BT expect all of their customers to be clairvoyant! I shall not ever use again!"
Dave,Coventry,2/15/17,"The service is fantastic when it works, I can easily run multiple devices for long periods of time.
Unfortunately the broadband does like to drop out for the occasional 5-10 minute slot, this tends to happen once or twice a day. From speaking with others this is apparently a common feature.
In the even you have an issue you will find the customer service to be awful (by far the worst I have ever dealt with in any industry).
I have dealt with them on numerous occasions and you can always expect a minimum hold time of 40 minutes. Every time I have had an issue it has taken the best part of 3 calls to resolve over a period of days, completely unacceptable in this day and age. (my last loss of service lasted 15 days, with BT only refunding me for 5 days loss of service - line rental, a pathetic attempt at compensation).
Usually phone calls are dealt with by cutting you off, creating a fictional resolution that can only be implemented after you close the phone call (had this numerous times only to find nothing gets fixed). My advice would be not to let them put the phone down on you, as they will not return calls and you will have to wait in a queue system to get back in.

I hope this helps. Generally the quality of the product is great, but you will have to put up with the occasional short drop in service. You would also have to be willing to put up with the worst and most arrogant customer service assistants possible."
"David, football fan and family man",SW20 London,2/15/17,"This is the first time I've done one of these to complain. But BT's ability to deliver what they've confirmed is almost zero. Their lack of customer care when things have gone very wrong [ which I had to convince them I didnt actually have a aerial on my roof ] is even lower and their sense of urgency is going in reverse as they've run from my problem not to it. I am amazed they are so bad and ashamed they call themselves British, Libby Barr your team are a disgrace."
LOUISE,DURHAM,2/14/17,"BY FAR the WORST company I have ever had to deal with. Lying underhand arrogant company with staff who dont give a hoot about the customer. A CEO who clearly needs to wake up to the reality of his company as if they could be make hundreds of thousands more in customer retentions by actually training his staff in a more positive manner. I will be off with another company ANY company when I get out of this unfair contract. BEWARE they start your cooling off period when you order, NOT when you get the equipment or start the contract. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Donal Massey,Macclesfield,2/13/17,"Dreadful, unreliable and expensive.
Long distance call centres offer poor customer service.
When out of contract they started charging me for all sorts of stuff."
Leverjones,Leicestershire,2/12/17,"Quoted 30 to 40 down load speed best actual only 18 sometimes as low as 14 basic answere when contacted tough luck.
My thoughts is I am being ripped off last time I signed up they sold me Infinity 2 and Tv and do NOT provided in the area the Tv froze as the speed could not provide a constant picture"
David,Netley Abbey,2/11/17,"Overall BT has not been too bad however it's the line rental prices that really get my goat!!! at 8.68mbps Download speed
quoted UP to 17mb."
Andrew Mckie,Edinburgh,2/10/17,"BT are liers about their prices and their speeds. I am on their 'normal' unlimited broadband deal, and last months BT bill was 59 pounds, that's without using the phone, so just line rental and broadband cost, much higher than anything they advertise. Add to that the fact that the phone wont make international calls even though I am being charged for one of their reduced price internatinonal calls deals, the calls just don't get through. Its so bad we do not use the phone and wish we could just get our broadband without it. As so many have pointed out their customer service is worse than rubbish, they just don't get anything done or even try to. Avoid them."
John wood,Maldon,2/9/17,"Replied to and e/mail an upgrade as it seemed to be offering a speed upgrade.So I payed for a different router.When checking my new router there was no difference .I complained to find out it wasn't the upgrade I expected?

Dan,Isle of Dogs,2/9/17,
Rachel,Derry,2/8/17,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR BT BROADBAND. Even rating the wifi and bt services is more than generous. We get the premium wifi package, we specifically pay more to get a better wifi. Complete rubbish! It's unbelievably slow, everything buffers all the time. The wifi also cuts out at least 4 or 5 times a day. It was off today and yesterday for 30mins even after turning it on and off. Staff are so rude and unhelpful. Would highly discourage anyone from purchasing bt broadband"
Thomas,Bath,2/8/17,"Speed and reliability poor. Get asked if we wanna renew. Agree after being told we'd get upgraded hub. Details discussed. Weeks later they send same old hub anyway. I ring and spend over 1 hour to customer services, 3 different advisers/departments later. All of this repeating the same stuff - sometimes being contradicted and having to argue/go in circles. Final lady sorts it out quickly, agreeing to send the hub we were promised. We shall see if it is right this time!

I asked about compensation for it taking an hour of my time after their mistake - not possible. Pretty rubbish service considering their mistake has cost me time and stress."
Andrew,Basingstoke,2/7/17,"We were forced to use BT since Virgin did not have any fibre close enough. At last they have recently dug up the roads and installed fibre so we can rid ourselves of the worst broadband supplier I've ever experienced, hands down.

Promised 27mbps and every night I get 1 to 5 only. Also very bad customer service who are untrained and know little more than to suggest ""you reboot the router"" they were rude enough to challenge my speed tests. I am a network engineer more qualified than any of their lost staff in the call centre who have no idea beyond the 'cheat sheet' they are using. My 5 yo could do a better job.

BT. I'm so happy to be rid of you at last!! Thanks Virgin."
Benjamin,London,2/7/17,Worst customer service I have experienced. Our internet has now suddenly just stopped working twice in the last two months and it takes them over a week to get an engineer to you. Such a massive waste of time for a poor service
Vicky Queen,Dundee,2/7/17,"Shocking customer service! having major problems with my phone line and internet and youview box paying for a device that is not working reported fault numerous times had an engineer sent out, who told me the previous engineer had not fixed the fault properly when he left the fault seemed to be resolved but now 3 days later back to square one again tonne told by a very cheeky customer service advisor from the call centre in India I may have to pay £130! I refused to accept this as clearly it's a fault with BT and there engineers have not fixed the fault in the first place so am now currently waiting on a manager to call me back just getting sick and tired paying for a service I'm not being provided with!"

Gary,Leyland Lancashire,2/6/17,"Hi
Joined bt back in September 2016 and although the broadband is good, the customer service is shocking. I have spent at least 5 hours on the phone to them trying to sort out issues with billing, I was lead to believe that my broadband was fixed for twelve months £10.00 + line rental, but no I got an email tonight telling me it's going up by £2.50 per month from the 2nd of April 2017 so explain that one bt how does that work!! Tried to ring them tonight got though after the normal twenty to thirty minutes waiting on hold, only for them to hang up on me...seriously think very carefully before joining bt they are a nightmare to deal with."

Goldfish,Grimsby,2/3/17,"Recently moved to BT from Sky to gain the use of BT Sport.
Promised the world and as yet received nothing but poor service, unreliable broadband, incorrect broadband speeds, appalling customer service (had the phone put time on me numerous times), had the £150 voucher dropped to £100 (now sorted), had a threat of a £120 engineers bill before I even got connected, the list goes on, I for one will be going back to SKY asap."
S. B,London Canary wharf,2/3/17,"BT have not resolved the issue since August 2016 until now - February 2017. I have all the evidence from August 2016 from phone call recordings & 9 reference numbers regarding this issue since then. As a BT business customer I myself have raised this issue 4 times now & nothing has been done. It has cost my business loss of earnings as i am still unable to put in a new order with BT until they have resolved this matter. I have 0 faith in this being resolved now and have contacted Watchdog & ombudsman. Be warned by this, as BT's collassal mistake leaves you in a diabolical mess. Not worth it. Watch out for this on watchdog viewers!"

Natalie Roberts,"Liverpool, Bootle",1/29/17,"Internet speed is less than half a mb. 12 - 15 minutes to download a 45mb app.

Told month ago that it was due to be improved but after speaking with neighbours. No work has been completed. Extremely unhappy."
Rob,Newport,1/28/17,"BT have been a nightmare from day one. It took a month for them to arrange an appointment to connect our phone line, and when the day eventually came round the engineer left before finishing the job, leaving us without a working phone line or internet connection. BT have also been fraudulently billing us for calls apparently made before our line was connected! Trying to talk to anyone takes over an hour of waiting on hold, only to be told that they won't deal with your problem, or they have no idea what's been discussed before. The fibre internet connection regularly drops out at evenings and weekends, and drastically reduces in speed at busy times, making it virtually unusable. Absolutely one of the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune to deal with."
Hopkins,Norfolk,1/27/17,"BT-what an absolute joke this company are.We have now been without broadband for 6 weeks and no reason from BT as to why this is. We have had promises made that it will be up and running again by various dates and surprise surprise the dates come and go and still no Internet. We will definitely be leaving them as their service is the poorest that we have ever received from anyone, and trying to speak to someone who actually knows what they're talking about is impossible. I would advise anyone to avoid using BT at all costs,they're the most expensive and the service they provide to their customers is worthy of a ZERO star rating."
Emmo,London,1/27/17,"This is just the second time I've joined BT in my life and I now remember why I stayed away for so long! Customer service is absolutely atrocious, I've been hung up on numerous times and spoken to terribly, even when it has supposedly been a manager, and reliability is poor as it often cuts out for periods at night. The speed is alright when its working, but other than that I will be cancelling as soon as I can and never going back. Whilst I was with Sky was probably my best broadband experience."
Adam Feneley,West Drayton,1/26/17,"If I could zero scores for satisfaction, customer service and reliability I would. BT are by far and away the worst company I've had the misfortune to deal with. The fibre optic broadband is fast when it works. I've been with them for a year now and had 2 month long (or more) sagas caused by them, and customer service is terrible. Currently going to ombudsman since I haven't had service for a month.

The have almost double the industry average for complaints, and I'm surprised it's not higher. I almost feel sorry for the customer service employees, it isn't their fault the system they inhabit is so terrible. But they are regularly rude and unhelpful, so I don't really feel sorry for them.

I will never again give them any of my time or money."
Chris,Ipswich,1/26/17,"Superfast BT Broadband is not worthy of its own name. You will be lucky if you receive half the advertised speed you payed for and even luckier if your BT hubs connection to the internet doesn't just drop out randomly, and can stay out for several minutes. Never use BT broadband and I never will again, just Terrible."
LukeSheffield,Sheffield,1/26/17,"So many problems, have been told will be contacted within 24 hours so many times and they never have. Their customer support is non existent.

I would avoid at all costs, they couldnt get our phone connected for weeks. Then took longer to sort broadband despite calls and on-line chats. My wife and I have wasted so much time.

Have reported them to OFCOM over product miss-selling.

Consider other providers before BT, they are a broken company."
Parv,Cardiff,1/26/17,"BT has been the most expensive, broadband provider, charging me a huge amount of money more than £50 per month for the service they agreed to provide on £37.00

Kevin,Somerset,1/23/17,"As per other reviews, the customer service provided is terrible. Very unhelpful staff (BT raised prices last year to provide better customer service!). They will terminate the call if they don't understand your issue.
Complaint handlers say they will resolve the issues but never do. The problem just goes on and on and no one will do anything. BT prices are constantly going up to fund the Premier League, I am moving on."
Mrs S Dempsey,Masham N Yorkshire,1/23/17,"23rd Jan 2017 and been without bt internet since NOVEMBER 2016. I have rung them endless times, been re-assured endless times that they will fix it within 24hrs. Been told they have emailed technical support many times to find out next time I ring that no record of emails !!!! Advised to ask for a supervisor... dont do that they simply cut you off. Had new hub... engineer out... still no luck !!! Have spent hours waiting in for phone calls that never came. Engineer supposed to come tomorrow ( am having to take MORE time off work.) If it is not fixed tomorrow then I am closing my account. NEVER EVER use/trust BT. Worst suppliers of any service anywhere. Have only put 1 star as there isnt a 0 box."
Sorin,Birmingham,1/22/17,"This is the worst internet provider I have ever had, and I come from what the UK would consider a 3rd world country.

The reliability is horrific as internet goes down every 2 hours for no apparent reason. Sometimes it goes down for up 6 times in a row which makes it impossible to do anything really.

Took 2 weeks to replace a router (which I suspected as the being the problem at first).

Speed is mediocre as well.
I do not recommend this internet provider to anyone unless you enjoy getting angry often."
Kirsty Tyler,Hereford,1/22/17,"Tried to upgrade from residential to business in July 2016 for promised UK call centres and better service.

I tried to switch from BT residential to BT Business for my phone and broadband in July 2016, for promised U.K. Call centres and better service. They have made so many mistakes in this process I have lost count.

My phone was transferred and a direct debit set up. My broadband was not transferred in error. In November I rang to sort it out. As a result, my Broadband was transferred to BT Business, but I kept receiving overdue reminders for the account.

I rang yesterday to sort out the direct debit for the Broadband account. During the conversation I found out that back in November when my Broadband was moved, they closed my BT Business phone account, and transferred it back to Residential.

So as things stand right now, my phone line is currently back with Residential BUT my calls have not been billed to either account since November (glad I found out now, not in 5 years' time - I'm told they bill you retrospectively).

I have now received an email saying that they are closing my Business Broadband account.

All I want is my phone and my broadband to sit with BT Business, with active direct debits in place. Is that too much to ask?"
Tracey,West Midlands,1/21/17,Only given 1 star because there isn't a zero rating. Appalling service from the outset. I have been shocked that this level of service exits today. Please stay clear of BT.
Thomas,Cupar,1/21/17,Appalling speed 0.4 - 0.6 at best. Their customer contact email will not recognise the account number given by BT on my account. Thus impossible to register a complaint! Tried telephoning. Get cut off by call centre staff every time after explaining the problem.

Anonymous,Midlands,1/17/17,"AVOID. Dreadful service. Had to phone > 6 times to get direct debit sorted. Credit card details and security code given over 4 times. Each time verbal confirmation that all was well now. In spite of this, BT suspended internet without warning. Manager in UK office was offhand and said I should take a business contract, but denied that ordinary customers are treated worse than business - which doesn't augur well for businesses. Promises to call back and confirm arrangements in writing not kept. Conflicting information from customer services."

Barry Bristow,Camber,1/15/17,"6 months of low speed broadband and counting
Moved to Camber from S. E. London, where we had Virgin broadband at 70 mbps. Had to switch to BT at Camber as no alternative. Opted for BT infinity hoping for reasonable speed. Best so far 16mbps and that was by a BT engineer with a hard wired meter Typically 8-12 mbps. So far 5 engineers visits and hours online with no improvement. Yesterday down to 5 mbps again, contacted BT, they tested line and agreed there is a problem. Will send engineer but warned may charge £129 if fault is in house, note they installed line in house and charged for it. Tested it today, 2.5 mbps, received message from BT informing me that they have now found fault on line and will fix it, but not until 19/01/2017. I despair, especially as they have a monopoly, No point in switching as all suppliers have to use the same line."
Alex,SW London,1/14/17,"17 Mb/s Im having, aways gives me about 1-2 Mb/s download speed. Customer Service never replies (phone/facebook/email). I you have a choice DO NOT go for BT. I have to stay with them since it's the only one provider in my area..."

brian jones,west lancashire,1/11/17,"I would rate customer service as appalling if it existed at all. The fact is you literally cannot get hold of anyone who seems to understand, or is able to sort your problem.
Despite numerous calls to report an intermittent fault with broadband and landline, I am still no nearer having the issue resolved. I have had a call centre operative in India tell me that the problem is my router ( how she could check from the other side of the world is beyond me, and I work in telecomms).
I was subsequently sent a replacement router which turned out to be older than the one I have and needless to say did absolutely nothing to solve the problem, this I immediately sent back. I have tried without success to obtain a UK phone number or email address and wish I had never signed up to BT, I know that the problem with my service is the old copper cable dangling from the pole outside my house, it has been ther since the house was built 55yrs ago. This cable has been swinging in the wind, rain, snow and ice for all those years and has obviously degraded, but unfortunately BT operatives don't seem to understand what I'm talking about and refuse to do anything other than send me replacement routers ???. Awful service."

Daniel Small,Wiltshire,1/10/17,"Can only review on customer service as an engineer never attended to install the phone lone/broadband. After receiving a bombardment of reminder messages emails and phone calls to ensure I did not forget my appointment, I booked the afternoon off work to wait for the engineer. Needless to say the engineer never turned up and there was no message/email/phone call to explain. I tried to call the engineer direct whos number I was sent prior who did not reply. I tried to get some answers on online chat that evening with no joy. I called the next day after not receiving a call from them to explain and when they finally found my order they could not give me answers as to what happened. All I was told was that I would have to wait longer for a different provider. Shouldn't be hard to provide a better servive."
Abbie,Leeds,1/10/17,"All I can say is this company is disgusting being a customer service manager myself I have never expirienced such a poor level of service, they accidentally cut me off for over a week when I work from home so I was at a loss of earnings I had the phone put down on me 8 times!! I had one person become abusive and two make false promises that weren't even noted on my account. I was then told I would have an amount credited to my account due to loosing my service and instead the debited the amount Aswell as also charging me £20 extra on my bill for services with no notification which they are required to do by law. Then I get the news they are charging me £32 on charges because my bill wasn't paid on time due to the fact I was waiting on a call been listened to that never actually got sent to be listened to them one lovely chap said we will send debt collectors. Now I'm taking them to court to recover the funds I lost in earnings Aswell as compensation we will see who has the last laugh."

Ian H,Hampshire UK,1/7/17,"The most frustrating company I've ever dealt with. Broadband problems (frequent intermittent drop-outs) for months. Regular phone calls to their 0800 111 4567 'help' centre. Each time I kid myself into thinking that this time I'll get someone on the line who can help. Each time they read their scripts and pretend to be sorry. Engineer visits to fix their faulty lines are a waste of time. One day they say it's my faulty home-wiring, the next day it's the BT exchange, and then a different excuse, but no solution. It's gone on now so long I think I've found the problem myself (following countless hours research) but getting BT to make a tiny configuration change at their end has so far proved beyond me (despite many calls/emails). If you can avoid BT then do so. At the very least avoid any long term contracts with them."

Catherine Green,Chichester,1/6/17,Poor customer service. Great internet speed but pretty pointless if the internet connection drops out at least 9 times a day. No one gets back to you in a reasonable time. Hopeless. Worse internet ever.
Matthew,London,1/6/17,"Their sales team are veritable pirates, as what I read on here confirms. Selling deals that are not the best for customer and yet locking you into a contract you can do nothing about and being told you are on this contract and that cancellation is a chargeable action.

They also RAISED the price in breach of our 12 month contract, and yet if I wanted a better deal as I had been recommended a bad deal there was essentially nothing I could do.

I raised a complaint issue, and was to be offered a callback, which I had to wait 18 days for! This callback did not come, and when I called to find out why, I was told that the system said that they had called and spoken to me! I asked, so, um, what does it say was resolved in this non existent call?! Needless to say, there was no answer.

They seriously need to sort out their sales team, they are chirpy rogues. I cannot speak for other departments, but they soured an entire lifetimes brand loyalty for me in chasing extra pounds. Well done /s I will not recommend this company to anyone. I certainly will not go to SKy as have no desire to line Murdochs pockets either. BT Sales and their contract are an utter shame and an abuse of my prior loyalty and trust."

Joe Sansiviero,Braintree,1/5/17,"Just for starters I have had to put 1 star as could t leave 0. BT are by far the worst company we have ever had to deal with.
We were originally miss sold a package. Told we would be getting a certain speed for broadband with BT sport thrown in as well. But when the confirmation email came through the next day it stated something completely different.
We called BT and were told it needed to be investigated and the original phone call listed to. If we were right they would honor what was originally said for the same price. They then said the process would take until the 4th Jan.
We know we were right so agreed to wait with the knowing it would be resolved.
I stayed home all day yesterday (the 4th) waiting for my phone call from Sam who claimed to be a complaints manager. I even called myself a couple of times to chase the situation. Everyone that I spoke to said that they could t deal with it and I had to wait for Sam, but not one person knew where she was or if she was even in? One guy even told me off the record that we were right but had to speak to Sam to get it sorted. All day her direct number went to answerphone and my mother in law sent emails as well. We had waited 2 weeks and wanted an answer!
Anyway we heard NOTHING yesterday from Sam the complaints manager.
And at 8.10am this morning the phone rings, low and behold it's her...
Sam then goes on to ask me AGAIN to tell her the situation as she still needs to listen to the call!!?? Hang on a minute why have we waited 2 weeks then??
We then had to wait a further 45 mins for her to call back and tell us that we were right... However the best they can do is reduce it by £6 which is NOT what we were promised! Sam Willis was rude and ignorant and clearly didn't care about keeping or losing our custom.
So after all that waiting they couldn't honor what we were told. If we had known that we would of cancelled 2 weeks ago instead of living with pretty much 0 connection.
We have now signed up with Sky who straight away have given far better customer service! Let's hope the connection speed is better too!

MY ADVICE IS DO NOT GO WITH BT! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
Jo,Bristol,1/5/17,Breathtakingly awful service. The sorry tale is too long and tedious to recount. Suffice to say I just can't imagine what is going on at BT. It is an utter shambles although the actual individuals I've spoken to on the phone are reasonable and doing their best. There is clearly some massive fault in the basic running of the company.
Sellathurai Mehavarnan,Ilford,1/3/17,"My BT broadband is not working since the end of November. We have called their staff several times; however the service they give is poor and they do not give a solution. Moreover, some staff hang up as we are talking. We request to move to another service provider but they lock us with the contract we have with them. They ask £150 to cancel the contract. I advise that if you want go to BT then don't sign the contract. Most customers like me also gave BT a bad review. BT are now thinking of money instead of their customers' service. I have made a lot of complaints but they did not take action. They don't have professional workers and service as they say that the contract said there will be no guaranteed Wi-fi. Also they make me angry and my blood pressure has gone high. Unfortunately, I don't want to give any stars above but you have to give stars to submit the review. I recommend you to go to a provider who gives Wi-fi that is guaranteed."
Des,Fraserburgh,1/2/17,"Been with B.T. for about 10 years, iv'e moaned ,complained ,iv'e waited and waited, i even paid Microsoft thinking it was my P.C. that was the problem and that was a waste of £70, Back to B.T.Ive upgraded iv'e had 3 new routers in the last year, and over the years the speed has remained the same with no improvement to the line and i only live 2 miles from the switchboard, whenever you phone to moan you get shoved from pillar to post and at the end of the line it's the same thing unplug this unplug that switch this and that off, as if i have'nt already done that ?, Get a grip B.T. WE ARE PAYING good money for a poor service"
Mark,Plymouth,1/1/17,"If you move to this company be prepared to not get the service you paid for.

Then be prepared for them not to care or do anything about it.

I've got the highest broadband, complete with a multi room set up... or shall I say that is what I PAY for.

I've been with BT for 8 months and just waiting until I can move in April.

The TV has never worked and we just use the broadband to stream from the internet and even the internet just mysteriously drops out fairly regularly.

I've spent hours and hours, waiting and on hold over the months. Passed from person to person, told someone will call me in a 2 hour window on 3 seoerate icassilns and just wasted my time as no one called.

We've completely given up and resigned ourselves to the fact that BT was a complete waste of time and a massive inconvenience.

We've. been in contact with the Ombudsman but their investigation said that we should be given a £75 goodwill gesture, whilst in the mean time we still pay more than hat per month whilst we count down the time until we can leave our contract.

The bodies that look over companies such as BT need to wake up and read he 1000's upon 1000's of reviews in line and give BT an ultimatum to sort themselves out.

If you do decide to go with BT after reading all of these reviews then you deserve the next 12 months of anger, frustration and wasted money"
Mubbashir,London,12/30/16,"Customer service team very unhelpful.
everytime i call them to complain about the net not working or the hub not working they just send new hubs so since the past 3 months ive had 5 hubs all faulty!! Big mistake joining bt"
Caroline A,Berkshire,12/29/16,"Joining BT is one of the worst decisions I have ever made!!

In the three months since joining I have had two faulty hubs and have been waiting for my third for over a month now. I've been fed a pack of lies about when this will arrive. I have spent hours (literally) on the phone or, more accurately, on hold to their call centres. I have now had to explain the situation an impressive 10 times to various people, who clearly can't help me. I have logged complaints and heard nothing back from them despite requesting someone contacts me. If I was charging an hourly rate for my time I'd have been on a nice little earner! Oh and another joy was having to verify my identity EVERY time I spoke to a different person as I had been entered as Mr. That was enjoyable and not at all irritating.
However, one thing BT do very well and should pride themselves on is taking my money. Every month without fail - on the dot! No reflection in the charges of the fact that I've been without the internet for roughly a third of the time I've been a customer mind you.

So as I would warn off someone from dating a deadbeat ex, I feel I must do the same with BT. I'm in it up to my neck, for the next 9months at least. But you still have a chance to avoid it."
M cropper,Lincolnshire,12/29/16,"When broadband works it's OK,but when it goes wrong, good luck. Horrific sums it up.can't believe this is able to go on in this day and age. Real shame football fans have to sign up to this to watch the game...."
John Campbell,Dunoon,12/29/16,After trying to convince Plusnet for a year that there was a broadband problem I switched to Vodafone. The problem persisted but then Vodafone agreed to send out a technician who found and fixed the problem in one afternoon. The technician (Martin Allison) was outstanding both in attitude and skills. Well done BT and well done Martin.

Pablo,Herefordshire,12/25/16,"Still waiting for connection to phone, internet and tv. Promise after promise since 6th December. There is already a line to this property. There is only one of me and I swear I could do a better job at talking to my customers..."
Edward Roberts,Pembrokeshire,12/24/16,"2 year contract - didn't work for 12 months - spent literally days on the phone - 7 no show call outs which meant 7 days off work. Gave me £50 compensation. In all my time I have never known a company to be so bad. Even closing my account they forgot to take my last payment so 2 months down the line they threatened court action but decided never to tell me I hadn't paid.
Will never return"
PAUL,Weymouth,12/23/16,Absolutely shocking probably the worst customer services out there
Mike,Sevenoaks,12/22/16,"Being rural, we are supplied by phone and broadband via copper wire from the exchange. 2.2 Mbs. I applied for BT infinity 5 years ago and checked progress with the upgrade, online. Two years ago I was advised that we would have Infinity within a year but when it didn't happen I contacted Openreach and they confirmed that we had slipped off the priority list and now we are not even on the schedule. Talk about not knowing what they are talking about."
Kelvin,Goole,12/21/16,"BT have been shocking from the minute we signed with them.Took an age to get the internet and Wi-Fi set up in the first place,main reason I went with them was to get BT Sport as well which is a nightmare to try and get on so never use it,called two days ago to complain that the Wi-Fi speeds are really slow even though we pay for Fibre Optic Broadband, sent an engineer out who has blamed it on our wiring but now it is not working it all!!I have lost wi-fi and landline now and bearing in mind I run my business from home I am losing income all the time it is and they want to charge me £130 if the engineer comes out and says it's our fault,even though it was working before the engineer came just slowly!"
B,London,12/21/16,"Disgusting service, the communication when you phone up BT is a joke, the agents are ignorant and the moment you want to complain, you will be cut off deliberately or sent on a run around, the complaints team will not address this part of your complaint, they will just ignore it and not respond to it formally, I have proof and ignorance is not an excuse. BT are scandalous and their complaints team is not impartial, they cover up and will try to spin doctor everything in any verbal communication and will simply not address anything formally in writing that is harmful to BT. The complaint handler will make a conclusion on a situation that occurred which is far from accurate and when you counteract it and expose the ignorance in the conclusion the handler will not respond to it specifically in the next email. Ignorance is not an excuse BT, sorry, do not act like your complaint handlers do not know what they are doing, it is all carefully contrived.

Takes approx an hour to get the complaints procedure with the name of the ombudsman they are signed up to when on the phone due to spin doctoring and shocking tactics.

Internet will cut out when it pleases and comes back when it pleases, been offered the same resolution twice that does not work and when offered it the third time you can only refuse.

Complaining does no help as mentioned, the complaint handler will ignore anything formally written that requires a response that could jeopardize T position in the complaint.

Stated explicitly not to be contacted verbally after taking legal advice, this was also stated in writing in my formal complaint to BT through the right channels but yes, you guessed it.. 2-3 calls to my mobile and landline, voice messages left on the mobile and landline, even started receiving text messages, almost laughable that they think this type of tactic/harassment is acceptable even after stating in black and white that you require BT to respond formally in writing only and not to call. But they call to figure you out, what you know and what you do not know to exploit to their advantage.

They claim to have the best wifi signal in the UK, from my experience, no way in hell is it even close.

As you can see from 90% of the reviews on this website in regards to BT, even the most recent ones... Avoid like the plague!

Remember, if the broadband company does not provide you with the service contracted for, ask them for the ombudsman they are signed to and follow the correct channels for the formal complaint procedure, know your rights, you can have the contract cancelled without a fee under many circumstances and be entitled to compensation. Just make sure you log every problem you have because the BT team will deny them even though they can check the history on their end.

I speak from experience with proof, this is not opinion. I have it in black and white."
Yasar,Birmingham,12/21/16,The broad band is terrible it is also very overpriced I was paying over 50 a month for bt infinity yet it had some really slow speeds
James,Gosport,12/20/16,
Gareth,N Ireland,12/20/16,"Don't do it, just don't. No other provider can be as poor as BT in terms of service provision. Coupled with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Order placed on 22/11/16, after 3 unsuccessful attempts for BT to complete the order internally, I cancelled on 08/12/16. By which point I had been disconnected from my previous provider. A full refund was supposed to be paid within 5 working days - supposedly confirmed as actioned that day by a BT manager. Roll forward to 20/12/16 the refund has still not be processed. No accountability, no-one cares. Never using BT again."
Andrew Robertson,Tayport,12/19/16,"For an age we have had ongoing unresolved problems with noisy landline, poor broadband and poor picture quality on our television. BT are so difficult almost impossible to contact and discuss these issues. The latest contact we had a few weeks back we were advised that an Engineer would check our line at the exchange. We did receive a call a day or so after the Engineer was supposed to check our line yet when I asked what was found the BT person calling could not provide any report. The issues have continued and when I check fault tracking the latest landline fault remains unresolved since the 02/12/16 - 17 days ago. Seems they have given up. We live in an isolated property and wonder now about the condition of our underground line which I understand is copper cable. We subscribed to BT Infinity around 6 months ago and also bought new phones from BT thinking our service would improve - not so - it got worse. At a loss now what to do or where to go for help with this"
Charlie,Battersea,12/19/16,"The broadband is okay, not exceptional but okay. It drops from time to time at night but I experienced the same thing with Sky broadband, albeit, less frequently. The things that I really dislike are the fact that when you initially contact them, they tried to upsell me BT infinity, despite the fact that I clearly didn't need it; in addition to this, call and late payment charges are quite steep. I will definitely be migrating once this horrible contract is up."
Josh Cantwell,Leeds,12/19/16,Paying an overpriced contract for whats nowadays considered an absolutely pathetic upload and download rate thats stability can be considered that of the Titanic. It drops regularly to less than 500KB/s download and 200KB/s upload. Disgrace.
NICOLE SKILLING,Ammanford,12/17/16,"Pathetic service from BT epecially if in a hurry to get an active line. They will promise you an installation date in approx 1-2weeks time and then tell you repeatedly on the day that it doesn't activate till midnight , then the next morning you will call as not activated and the will give you another date 2 weeks down the line. when questioned on why? they will blame BT Openreach so then you will contact them and they will blame BT. Its all a big joke and they will offer you absolutely nothing, leaving you with no internet to complete any business over the christmas period.

Beyond Bad service , dont deserve 1 star at the moment."

Nick,Lincolnshire,12/16/16,"BT have given me a poor service throughout my 30 months of use from them. Unfortunately in my area BT was the only fiber service I could get, the speeds they sold me on were never reached. I complained multiple times and asked them to improve the line but I was constantly told that the speeds I was shown on my computer, through the official BT Web page checker, were either wrong, in package limits or that they would send an engineer to the box who never arrived.

I never expected the speeds to be consistently at the level I was sold but being told that a 25 Mbps discrepancy is within my package limits, the highest one, is absurd. Plus every drop in the internet was categorised as a one off incident and therefore never needed investigating.

In the end I gave up complaining as it was a waste of time. However when I left the property and got a £31 disconnect fee I was not happy. I disputed it as policy says you don't have to pay if you move to an address they can't provide to, but this does not count if you move abroad. I have been left feeling very bitter about BT and their service was consistently bad to the end. On my return to the UK I will never again be a BT customer."
Ghulam,Ilford,12/15/16,"I was a sky customer and had it for 2 years. Never had problems. I thought BT will be better than Sky but I was wrong. I switch to BT and got services after 10 days since the activation date. After 3 months I got problem again now since 8 December this month I haven't got broadband. First they said it will be sorted by 10 December then BT said it will be sorted by 14 December. Called on 14 December again new story that somebody will call you on 15 December. Called BT today twice again new story somebody will call tomorrow. I HAVE NEVER EVER TO THIS SITUATION. Such a rubbish company. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE BT TILL I AM ALIVE. If you want to make your life miserable, stress or want to take revenge recommend them BT."
philippe b,lonond,12/15/16,"They stop my connection with my previous supplier while they were not in position to provide the service. And as solution they suggested that I should go and buy a dongle somehwere and use it until they could resume the service.

This is what happen, I used to be a BT customer 2 and half years ago I moved my broadband service to EE as part of a deal on mobile phone. EE broadband was never as fast as BT. So when BT called me over a month ago mentioning that they had bought EE and if I wanted to come back to them I accepted. I asked three specific questions: 1) will i have to do anything, because I am extremely busy until Christmas and if i have to do anything it will have to wait until the new year. the response was I will just have to plug the new Hub in.
the second question was if there will be any interruption with the supply as i run an IT business and need online communication with INDIA 24/7. the response was no, no interruption, not even one hour. I then ask what the speed will be answer: 70 MG/s minimum and up to 80. All sounded excellent so I agreed and give all the necessary details and received straight away email confirming the order and that the switch over will take effect on the 12th of December. few eek later a letter came from EE mentioning that they have been asked to stop the service from the 8th of December. Alarmed that i could potentially have no connection for 4 days I called BT, the only thing they could tell me was that the order will be completed on the 12th. (i never called EE until then, as BT was supposed to make all the necessary arrangement with EE). So i called EE and they confirm that the services will continue until the 12th. On he 12th of December I plg my new HUB and...NO connection. an engineer turns up (without me calling) to check if its all OK and find no fault other that the speed is 40mgs instead of 70mgs. I then call BT who told me that there is ""an open exception"" on the line and they can't provide the service. (they had already stopped the service I had with EE). After mucb discussion i was offered the option to go somewhere and buy a dongle for each of my computer, until the service resume supposedly 48 hours later?!?!?! 3 days later still no services, and now i am been told that I will have to wait another 4 days.... and as solution i should shop for dongles."
Lou Ellie,Northern Ireland,12/15/16,"Would give them less than 1 star if possible - absolutely dreadful company, avoid them at all costs. Engineers not showing up, clueless call centre workers who lie and fob you off, managers who never call you back and the audacity to charge you for line rental when it's been 7 weeks and you still have no phone line or internet connection. This company are the worst and they do not deserve to receive any more support from paying customers. Go with Sky or another company that seems to have a clue what they are doing."
Gerry,Essex,12/15/16,"Got a good reduced deal 18 months ago. A few dropouts recently that required an engineer to visit house. Service staff called several times to make sure everything had been fixed. Can't really fault the way I was treated. I did have a job understanding the regional accent of the caller -I would guess a strong Asian accent.
My real bugbear is pricing, the moment the contract ended the price more than doubled to just under £40 pm and I never use the phone for calls. Searching around for a cheaper deal seems to throw you int the arms of the worst of the worst if the reviews are to be trusted. John Lewis, Origin, Tentel, all much cheaper but it seems all who are with them wish they weren't.
So where do I go? Pay over and stay with BT or risk it!!! I think I'll still have to search."
Barry,Berkshire,12/14/16,"If you like a massive language barrier, hearing outright lies from agents, going round in circles, waiting for up to 30 minutes listening to silence while they run ""tests"", speak to agents who know don't know how to use a BT Home Hub, and getting fobbed off with ""please wait 2 days while we monitor your connection"" then call BT broadband technical support now! The Openreach guys are great but its so difficult to get an appointment booked with an engineer now (even if you offer to pay for it) that you are forced to endure the worst tech support service on the planet. 11 months and counting until I switch to Zen."
Katrin,Durham UK,12/14/16,"THE WORST
They might market themselves as the fastest broadband but signing BT was the worst mistake. We have had wifi cuts every single day and when we tried to file a complaint on BT website, it simply told us to check if the router was connected properly. After sending a very angry email we were finally contacted by their customer service. They asked us to test the connection with the cable which still did not help. Then they finally sent an engineer. After the engineer visited everything got even worse and we basically do not have any connection anymore.
Hopefully this will solve eventually and I must say their customer service is very good, but it has been taking over a month now and we are all upset. I would really think twice before signing BT and in case you have problems, make them to send the engineer over right away, not waste time with some tests that do not help."
Simon Ramos,London W2,12/14/16,"Be AWARE !! After placing an order and have to wait for over 8 weeks before I got my parcel "" because apparently got lost in the post.."" Same problem happen to my neighbour.. Once we received it I had to wait over 2 weeks because of a problem on ""the area"", each time the engineer visited the flat I were told that the services would work soon.. nothing happen, next day called again and were told that a senior engineer would have to come to check the issue again, this happen 5 times, customer services have not a clue and miscommunication between wether the callcentre is located and the UK are none !!
Stay Away !!"
Steve,Stroud,12/14/16,"I was thinking of switching from BT, but only on cost grounds as I have only ever had good reliable service with a very helpful customer service backup. The speed here (rural, no fibre) varies from 5mbs to 8mbs, which is adequate for most things like viewing movies etc. Having seen some of the reviews here, I must be connected to a different BT!

The Post Office was my chosen replacement provider but they appear to be even worst, so I'm going to stick with the devil I know."
David donnelly,Farnborough,12/14/16,"Without doubt the worst company I have dealt with, the customer service telephone system is designed to make it difficult or impossible to get to speak to anyone and when you do get through to someone in some far flung country who you can hardly understand because of the lack of English, they are rude and have no customer service skills at all, clearly bt want to pay a minimum wage and ship out the call centres to foreign countries, trying to get a refund for the credit on my account was nightmare, seemed to me that they have been advised to tell you anything or lie in order to hold onto your money. Never never again will I deal with this company and can't wait for my contract to end. Advise anyone to stay well clear of British telecom. Disgusting."
Alan Marples,Sheffield,12/13/16,"Wish I had stayed with plain broadband, i keep loosing infinity many time per day, I've been writing this now for half an hour, Witten it 4 times, but haven't managed to finish it as it keeps going down. Lost it again, now it's back. Wonder for how long."
zijiang yang,sheffield uk,12/13/16,"It was good at first year. 24/7 good fluent and 2m/sec download speed. I guess it was because I was the first BT user in this building(I paid the line installation fee). Then at second year, the nightmare began. Instability all the time at random periods of day. Download speed was down to 1mb/sec. I guess BT just add another client so we have to share this line. Yet the staff just cannot do anything."
D,Weston,12/13/16,Terrible customer care and service. Be nice to speak to someone that understandshe me!
David,Lisburn,12/12/16,"Switched to BT phone connected 30 Nov. Still no sign of broadband 12 days later. Only spent 6 hours on the phone to their customer services over at least 12 calls, only problem they're still not providing me with a customer service. Still no sign of when or even if they can install broadband. Efficient.... Don't think they even deserve 1 star rating as I don't have a service to rate. When off when will it happen...."
Dennis Abley,"Chedburgh, Bury St.Edmunds",12/12/16,"Having gone to BT because of their Infinity deal a year ago (approx.) I have had numerous problems, an unhelpful, round in circles, conversations.
Currently, I have spent over a month with a background ""crackle"" on the phone making conversation next to impossible, and my ""wonderful"" Hub cutting out and recycling,(on 1 particular day from 11a.m. to 4.30p.m.).
My suspicion is as follows;- On this estate, the cabling comes in underground (and the Fibre only comes to the distribution box, apparently}. Whenever we see an Openreach Technician doing something to the wiring in the compartment on the FOOTPATH outside our property (we assume adding another customer to INFINITY)when he/they leave we invariably have the problems. At this moment in time my Internet SEEMS okay, but the phone is still not right, and I wait with baited breath for another Openreach occurrence."
CARL,LINCOLN,12/12/16,"sorry the stars don't go into negative.
promised 89-90 got 12,change ethernet card,got 20-30,changed to a high speed ethernet cable,no change.

It constantly drops and a lot of the time barely gets broadband speeds. Customer service will have you jumping through hoops for god knows how long, I really didn't have time to sit around for hours on the phone trying to get it sorted. I waited out the 12 months and now I'm moving everything away from BT."
Chris,Worcestershire,12/9/16,"After discussing about a better deal than the one that was offered online, I agreed to having fibre broadband on the deal that was discussed. The fibre was activated and I expected my bill to be what was discussed. However this was not the case and my bill was now £10 extra than expected. When I contacted BT over this issue, they denied all knowledge of me having any discussion over a better deal even though I have proof of this. They told me I could cancel my contract but it would cost me over £300 pounds.
I can't help but feel mugged and ripped off!
I should have stayed with SKY as they were faultless before!"
Stu Wood,Leicester,12/8/16,"Okay, 8 years with BT no problem. Really no problem.
Decided to move and spoke to an operator who stated.....just plug in at your new address and we'll call you....no call.
Called BT and spoke to a call centre.
After getting through the menu I spoke to a male who stated i'll put you on hold a minute....another male came on the line and asked me the same questions the first guy did.
What happened to the first guy I asked 'Sorry sir...I don't understand you' Then I was put on hold and disconnected.
next call...disconnected after security q's.
next call I spoke to a female who must have though I was quite stupid...is it plugged in??
Okay sorted....after 30 mins on line.
Then angrily called Customer Services.....cut off again.
Next call to CS....'we don't have the facility to cut you off'
....yes you do! you keep doing it.
Not sure if BT want my business or even care...disgusting behaviour and pure incompetence."
nathan hughes,Weston-super-Mare,12/7/16,"where do i start, well i just moved to a new flat on the 7th nov 2016, i then thought i go with BT broadband which they gave a a date for the 28th nov 2016 that then got changed to the 29th nov, i still had no internet, so got in touch with BT they booked out a engineer for the 1st dec, great start this was as a new customer, engineer turned up he gone his checks sid it was a fault from the outside whick in my books was good because i won't get charged the £129. he come back and said that the engineer that done it done it from the wrong CAB address then he said the good news is, is that i've sorted the phone line which i 'm not bothered about but he said the bad news is you still haven't got inter net until the sort out the fibre in the right CAB, so went back on the phone to BT they said they get it sorted the next day which then got changed to the 6th of dec, guess what didn't have internet on that day so i got back in touch again with BT they said they changed the date to the 7th because they wanted to do a big fix in my area as more people was having the same problem and i will without fail have the internet by 8pm no later on that day guess what still no internet, the funny thing is was when i moved to this address the people b4 had talktalk i know this because by chance i pluged my router in and guess what, i had internet it was only 17mb down and less then 1mb up but i had internet, as someone thats wants to start streaming to twitch tv and youtube i need more upload speed BT at the time was a good offer, which so far is the only good thing i have seen in BT the offer would be twice as good if the internet was working. If any off you guys are thinking about BT please beware!!"
Krish Rao,Weybridge,12/7/16,"After moving home, I was forced to get BT as they are the only ones supplying broadband to this area. They are horrific. Totally unreliable internet fails all the time. I hope virgin gets fibre to this area soon."
Christopher,Reading,12/7/16,"This is now the 5th time. Yes, the 5th TIME that we're trying to get internet home with BT and ONCE AGAIN IT FAILED.

I have spent a total of upward of 10 hours on the phone with BT. This is scandalous. The incompetence is beyond anything I've EVER seen and I've lived in many countries.

I'm going to start a class action. BT is making money from these customer service phone calls and I believe there is a real slyness behind this incompetence. Reading comments online, I am not the only one to be so disappointed and I believe there is a real chance for a class action to stick.

They've lot more than 10 hours of my time and at 20p/min, they're making tons of money from our phone calls.
Using the median.

At a cost of 20p/min, that's GBP 120 + time I've spent if we use the median income hourly rate (GBP 12.5/hour), that an additional GBP 125.

TOTAL = GBP 245

I really hope we can start a class action. And BT better understand the consequences. They will be serious: in terms of brand image as well as financially once a class action starts.

Do not proceed with them whatever you're thinking. They will waste your time - unless you're very lucky which has not been my experience (I'm not the only one apparently).

Ali,Manchester,12/6/16,"Rubbish company Paid for 12 months never fix my fault, only worked for the 1st day !!!!!! Terrible"
stacy,kettering northamptonshire,12/5/16,"this is the worst service I have ever had. I swapped over to bt at the beginning of October. firstly the phone line nor the internet worked even though they did before I changed.
after waiting 2hrs on the phone managed to get hold of someone they said there is nothing wrong but would book an engineer to come out.
1week later an engineer came out said nothing wrong outside and they wanted to charge us £129.
I rang again 1.5hrs later spoke to someone who said they will send another engineer out. yet again no problem apparently .. still no phone line or broadband.
rang again their exact words were nothing they could do.
after complaining they admitted that the line hadn't been switched over !!! this was done 48hrs later and all seemed well.
but 24hrs later broadband went down and guess what still not working 2months later and the official line from bt is nothing they can do.
but they still are charging me for the service.
I am trying to switch again but this is a struggle as the new company are saying that bt are blocking it even though I am paid up to date etc..
if you want to keep your sanity do not use bt !!!!"
Vladlena,London,12/5/16,"Guys, if you think you have got a nice life, don't have enough problems to suffer, then BT is for you!

In the last 6 days I met so many people who is not interested in helping you with a problem. My broadband is not working for 2 weeks, today engineer visited me and nothing happened! The doggiest and the worst provider all over UK! THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVICE BUT THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES! NEVER EVER WILL SUGGEST IT TO ANYONE!"
Thomas,Grantham,12/5/16,"They advertise as the most reliable WiFi signal. This is not the case.
I switched from Virgin Media due to rising cost. Never had any issues with the WiFi signal with Virgin. When I switched to BT I gave it a week or so to let equipment settle down. However broadband kept dying several times a day. After a few weeks and phones calls and eventually an email to their complaints department I finally got some testing on line that determined Hub was faulty. New hub installed. However, WiFi signal is terrible. I use BT app on phone to check service regularly as devices will disconnect and my phone often says switching to mobile data (as I have it set on poor WiFi to use mobile data), This is even when sat in same room as BT hub. Once year is up will be finding different provider."
Colin Grieve,Glenrothes,12/3/16,"Just discovered BtT have been money from my bank without my permission for over two years despite me cancelling my account my subscription with them. Apparently I didn't cancel the free bet sport so they've been charging me for this. Be warned.

Also the reason I left them was due to a poor unreliable service."
Divya,Greenwich,12/3/16,"Pathetic customer service
Insanely long waiting times on phone
Engineer does not turn up as promised
Order not placed as requested. (Choose the address they wish, date they wish, cancel the order without informing)
Nobody takes responsibility on customer service and keeps on transferring call saying other team is responsible. Each call transfer comes with overhead of atleast 20 min holding time.


Would have given NEGATIVE stars if there was an option."
Stephen Harrison,Bognor Regis,12/2/16,"I have the highest level of broadband Infinity and the latest Hub 6. The service is very expensive, with prices rising at least twice a year. The broadband drops out whenever ther is the slightest storm, wind or rain. TV advertisements are usually dishonest and deceitful, making outrageous claims as to coverage and reliability. 'Deals' are offered to new customers only with no regard to loyal customers.
Would advise anyone to look elsewhere as BT offer a poor, expensive service with little respect of customer loyalty."
Caroline,Lancing,12/1/16,"To say I am upset is an understatement. Customer service appalling. Promised a call back to discuss/finalise and complete my claim that an adviser set up on my behalf, still waiting for the call...3 months later to the day! They have managed to lose my original landline which I have had for years and use for work. This has affected my business hugely to the point where I have had to get new leaflets/flyers printed to my expense with the alternative number they have provided me with. Waited in for 3 hours for technician - no show! Told would have 2 call backs -still waiting. Told they would waive a couple of initial charges due to the inconvenience I have been caused, bill actually came out at £80 more than it should have!! Do you think I can get sense out of anyone at their end of the phone?? The hours I have wasted waiting on hold is beyond belief - a HUGE waste of my day. At the start of this fiasco they sent me a 'You View' box and extender kit FOC. 'You View' didn't work, only one plug instead of 2 in the extender kit. They said they would charge me £129.99 to send an engineer out to sort this - talk about rubbing salt into the wound!! If I could turn back time I would never, ever have used this company. Out of pocket, time and patience with BT!!!"
Michael,Liverpool,12/1/16,"Just a quick summary of the inadequate service I have received from BT throughout the complaint:



1. On 21st October I received a letter from BT stating that another customer wants to take over the phone line (Ref WLTUTC). The letter stated that if I did not call BT by 2nd November at 2pm the service will cease.

2. I called BT on 25th October to to advise that I did not authorize another customer to take over the line and to reject the take over request.

3. I was advised by BT that they will reject the takeover and I don't need to take any further action.

4. On 2nd November I had a complaint from my tenant that the broadband had stopped working at the property. I instantly knew what the issue was and contacted BT to inform them of the situation. I explained about the letter which I received stating that the broadband would cease on 2nd November and this is what had happened.

5. Although I explained exactly what the fault was to the faults team the BT advisor carried out some tests and concluded that my broadband was still showing as live on their BT system and the fault had nothing to do with the takeover request, but was in fact a router issue. Advisor said she would post out a new router within 3-5 wokring days.

6. Although I could not believe this was just a massive coincidence that the broadband stopped working on the date the letter said it would I gave the advisor the benefit of the doubt and she arranged to send a new router out in the post.

7. On 5th November I called BT for an update with the router. The faults team now changed their mind and informed me that the fault was not down tot he router, but it was now due to a network error which would ""100% be fixed by 9th November"". Again, I informed the engineer that the problem was down to the takeover request and again my advise was disregarded.

8. The broadband was still now working on the 9th as promised and when i called up i was shocked that the faults team now state its the router and sent yet another router out.

9. So far we have had 2 routers and both of them did not work. BT were still insisting it was a router fault so we decided to go out and buy our own router costing me £128. Again this did not resolve the issue so again BT sent a third router out which did not work. By this point I was angry, frustrated and disappointed in BT staff failure to identify a problem even though I kept insisting that the fault was down to the take over. I was still being ignored by the faults team.

10. BT decided it was best to send an engineer out who was booked in to visit the property on 17th November. The tenant and his son both took the day off work to wait in for the engineers visit but the engineer cancelled the appointment on the day. This meant that the tenant lost wages taking unpaid leave to sit around for the engineer who did not even turn up. This was now causing myself and my tenants unbelievable stress and disappointment.

11. We were advised that the engineer did not need to visit as they found the fault and promised the broadband would now be working on 19th November.

12. The 19th of November came and again more disappointment as the broadband was still not working. It was only when I was put through to the cancellations team in the UK to cancel the service with BT that I actually spoke with a woman who actually listened to me and done some further investigation and discovered that what I had been saying throughout this ordeal was actually correct. She discovered that the takeover was rejected by BT but the broadband had somehow slipped through the network and was cancelled.

13. Finally, someone in BT listened after 2 weeks of messing me and my tenant about. At least now we knew what the issue was.

14. The broadband was finally back working on 24th November (3 weeks after the fault was reported).

15. Throughout this time I have spent over 10 hours + in communication with BT. I have spend over £80 on phone calls from Thailand (not once would BT staff call me back as they stated they cannot call outside the UK). I have been given 4 different guaranteed dates when the issue should have been fixed. We have had to take unpaid leave to wait for the BT engineer who did not turn up, the tenant has had to use excessive mobile date due to no broadband, We have spent £128 on new router, I have had to pay the tennant £400 in compensation, I have been put through hell by incompetent BT staff who refused to listen to me. All of this could have been avoided if BT just listened to customers and stopped being ""robots"" just doing what they are told to by a computer.

16. This has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a service provider in my life. It has caused me so much stress and anger.

17. So I would expect the following to be compensation:

£80 calls from Thailand public phones
10 hours of my time talking to incompetent BT staff @ £10 per hour = £100
£128 for the new router we had to buy as you advised the 3 BT sent out were all faulty.
£100 for the stress and inconvenience this has caused me when I am supposed to be on holiday.
£100 towards the compensation I had to pay the tenants for taking unpaid leave to wait in for the engineers plus the excessive data usage when wifi was not working.
Total claim £508"
Dave K,Wales,12/1/16,"Living in an area where we have a BT only exchange we have limited choice of supplier.
Whilst the broadband has-been largely reliable and reasonable in speed when there have been problems it has taken hours and hours talking to customer services being kept waiting and passed from one department to another. I cancelled my mobile and they continued to charge me! Then I recently cancelled my home phone and broadband, despite emailing me to confirm this they again continued to charge me for a service I was no longer receiving!! Taking money from my bank.
If an individual did this it would be deemed theft.
In both cases it involved hours of calls to resolve, something I will not miss. Until they have decent customer services I could not recommend them."
Malcolm,Bakewell,12/1/16,Just had a fault on my BT landline and broadband traced to an underground cable. BT were brilliant and attended to the problem within hours of being reported. Really great service.
steve sharp,liskeard,11/30/16,"The worst customer experience ever!! Been with sky for 12yrs but they can not supply fiver broadband in our area. Order fibre on the 9/11/16 to be installed in the 23/11/16, had a call on the 11th no engineer available was then moved to the 01/12/16 had a call on the 14th no engineer available was moved to 02/12/16, received a call 29th guess what yes no engineer available so we are now looking at the 5th December. Call many time to complain but never any manage available..if only another provide was in my area.

nesbit,essex,11/30/16,"DO NOT SIGN UP TO BT....EVER!!!!!!
I have been with BT for a number of years with minimal problems until recently when i experienced repeated dropouts & snail speed. For the last 8 weeks, I have been trying to speak to somebody & getting them to understand this problem, this has nearly turned me insane. I am no further forward today as I was 8 weeks ago. When I requested to speak to a manager I was told I couldn't & they would only reiterate what the first person said. Every promise I was given was then contradicted by the next person, telling me ""my colleague wouldn't have said that, you are wrong"". I repeatedly requested the recordings of my conversation with BT only to be refused or no one ever called me back. I have so many reference numbers been given to me and constantly been told there is nothing wrong with my line or broadband & I haven't experienced any drop outs!!! The latest instruction from BT was that Wi-Fi is not guaranteed & I should be running ether cables to all my equipment. Even though I have a blue light on my hub that clearly says WIFI. To add insult I have been charged £7.50 for 'late payment' & the £20 gesture of good will that was promised hasn't materialised either. The worst customer care service I have ever experienced in my life. Like I said... steer clear!!"
Sam,London,11/29/16,"Slowest internet i've used I remember dial up being quicker. I'm surprised I managed to get on to this website. I frequently have to shut apps down to refresh them so they load/turn off the wifi to refresh the connection, absolutly terrible. BT reckon our internet connection is fast (BS). Wouldn't recomend BT"
Justin Murray,Redruth,11/29/16,"Unless you are desperate for BT sport steer well clear! I have had 7 weeks of hell dealing with these people and 16 phone calls. Initially ordered on 6/10, online via top cash back, that order was cancelled, re-ordered on 10/10 that order also cancelled. Apparently my line still belonged to my previous supplier. The 3rd time I ordered over the phone which meant I have lost out on £105 top cashback. They assured me I would be connected on the 7th Nov. My phone was connected on 14 Nov, Broadband on 21st Nov so over 6 weeks after initial order placed. I lodged a formal complaint which BT have failed to give me any resolution on and asked to be compensated but have been told there's no chance of that and I cannot cancel as I am now in a contract with them! This is by far the worst company I have had to deal with. Please steer well clear like I say unless you want the sport! 16 calls to them in 6 weeks, dreadful!"

Lex,Barnet,11/24/16,"Please don't risk it. BT are fine if everything works, but appalling if anything goes wrong (which it has nearly every year we've been with them).

Anon,Anon,11/19/16,Stay away from this company. They have the worst customer service and they have the worst broadband speed and reliability. The wifi crashes 2 times every hour and we just lost 200 pound concert tickets to a crash. This company needs to go bust.
Helen,warwick,11/18/16,I suffered with broadband speeds of less than 0.5mg for 2 months before moving to super fast broadband. During this time I spent so long on the phone trying to resolve and was always told there was a problem on the line we are sending engineer to fix. This happened more than 3 times and problem was closed but nothing ever changed. Felt I had no option but to upgrade after which I got approx 2 mg. I complained again and I was fobbed off with anther engineer but again no fix. Finally after using complaints procedure got an engineer who went up pole outside and fixed the line problem. For all my hours on the phone and months of them not delivering to contract was offered first £9 and then £11 in compensation. This is a big company who has lost control and as soon as my contract is up I will be off.
frustrated,egham,11/17/16,"After suffering repeated outages and slow internet speeds etc I decided to give Demon Vodaphone the boot and swap over to BT Business Infinity and BT Business Telephone line - two separate lines. The orders were placed, the hub was ordered, Demon were given notice of the take over and every thing was set for the grand swap over on the 31st of October. On the 25th of October no router had arrived so i rang BT Business - hello said I - where is my new router? Oh dear said they - your order has been cancelled - why said I - we don't know - turns out their office in India cancelled the order because they could. The manager from BT Business re-instated the order for the 31st - India cancelled it again - and so it went on - round and round and round - BT UK would order the service - then India would cancel it. I now have a temporary service on the voice line - so we have a choice of dodgy voice or intermittent sloth like broadband that is even slower than Demon and also more unreliable - plus the Hub-5 that screeches like a fish wife and glows like a nuclear reactor! All along BT tried to blame Demon - today I got an email from Demon proving that BT had been fibbing - they were waiting to vacate the line and had been since the 14th of October. BT even had the temerity to say that my BT phone was the cause of the problems - it was never a problem when the Demon was there! Customer Service is a joke - even when escalated up to the Chairman's Office gavin.e.patterson@bt.com in case any one wants the address or sme.service.scotland@bt.com - 0800 085 3662 - not that it got any where - 17th of November and I am still waiting.

Any suggestions about what to do next would be very welcome"

Stephanie Dunleavy,Rochdale,11/15/16,I chained from Virginia media to BT fibre in which my change over was meant to be active with BT from 17.10.16 and to this day I'm still not active. My Virginia contract ceased on 31.10.16 which was nearly 2 weeks after my BT services should have been up and running and still not BT service and to top it all off I have a business line in my property for my employment and the incompetence of BT being who they are they disconnected my business line as this was the only live line in the property at the time which has caused me to now have to place a new order to get the business line transferred to who it should have been in the first instance. I have lost money from this major mess up. They claim that they have had a problem with re systems as to why it's taking so long to get my services up and running meaning that they cannot send jobs to the engineers they are British telecom can they not use a phone to communicate like everyone else it would this be too simple. I had an update today regarding the activation of my BT service and was horrified to discover that an engineer had finally been to the cabinet on the street and now says there is not a spare fibre port to connect my broad band they can install new ports to the cabinet but it's a big job apparently in which they have to dismantle the cabinet to do so and this takes up to 3 months apparently to complete so the service I was promised I am no longer getting in which I could have been advised on this over 6 weeks ago prior to me cancelling my virgin media broadband as now I'm left with nothing not to mention having to pay all the BT activation charges and also have a new to Ariel fitted which cost me £130 at the start in which I now won't need as won't have BT tv as all they can offer me now is 4mb per second instead of the 50 I was promised and they say the 4mb will not be enough to get the BT to and the BT sport service that I signed up for. I have had multiple problems from the start of this process and been robbed off time and time again every advisor I speak to tells me something different each time. I would not ever recommend this well known company as they have caused me nothing but problems and issues throughout along with the major inconvenience with the issue with my business line and now I'm thinking of reporting them to watchdog due to the false selling and the bad service they have provided or should I say no service has been provided. Steer well clear from them they just want to take your money and leave you high and dry
Valerie,Craigavon,11/15/16,"Went back to BT in March 2016, we live beside a BT exchange, were paying the higher price to get a ""quicker"" broadband service. I had complained every other month to them. The speed of the broadband never changed, even with one person in the house, simple things like going on facebook was near impossible! They had verbally told me on the phone when I returned to them that I would not be tied into any contract with them. This again was revoked when I left them this month due to disgustingly poor internet service and came up with all sorts of ""get out clauses"". Even though mine was I was not paying for a service that I was not getting! So, now have to pay £148 to get out their contract plus return their equipment, which I thought would be included in the monthly charges? But I would NEVER, EVER again touch BT with a barge pole, and have already told loads of people in the large company I work for about my experience, which has definitely put a few people off BT!!"
Paul,Manchester,11/14/16,"Probably the worst broadband I have ever experienced! And all this fibre optic is rubbish, because the last mile is copper wire!!

DS99,Cheltenham,11/14/16,"Hobson's choice here with service providers. In general though the 20Mbs speed is acceptable and the service is generally reliable. However, the biggest bug-bear ever is the VERY poor customer service. They simply don't care. If it can't be answered in 5mins and from a script then forget it! I've been 2 weeks and counting with an issue and passed from pillar to post and all just want to get you / me cleared off their books just to satisfy their KPIs. Forget actually resolving the problem!!"
gethin,blackpool,11/12/16,"Horrendous wi-fi and terrible customer service
Options
on ‎12-11-2016 14h08

50 minutes on the phone to try to ask when I can get out of my contract....

The reasons are:

Having recently migrated to BT from another provider (fibre to standard broadband) i was left for over a week without any services, somehow my socket had become faulty.....

Once this was working I started to notice that I had no wi-fi in my other rooms in the house. I tried resets, everything, but still no wi-fi.

Deciding to call bt for assistance I was informed I could ""Purchase"" a super router 6 which would give me a better signal... (I didn't care about the quality of signal, just as long as I had a signal, which I didn't have).

So here it is folks...

Join BT, lose service for 7 days
Experience Broadband like no other, ie no broadband or wi-fi in other parts of the house
Customer service, terrible beyond belief.

I personaly can't wait to leave BT so I'm waiting for the end of my contract as BT will penalise me for leaving a terrible service.....

Disgusting"

Just before writing this review, I experienced two pauses while watching iPlayer via the Infinity hub. On a few occasions,, my desktop has lost the connection. Perhaps if there were several people in the house all sharing the hub, it might come into its own. I have several months of my contract to run so performance over the remaining period will determine whether or not I feel it is worth the extra money. At the moment I reserve judgement."
Paul,Mansfield,11/10/16,Phoned up to report a phone fault. Got called a rude sod by the person at BT when I wasn't happy they weren't going to do anything about it!!
James,Edinburgh,11/10/16,"Absolutely terrible service which is matched only by their terrible customer service department in India who cannot speak/write English, cannot wait until my contract ends. Will be leaving and not returning!"
Chris prior,Devon,11/9/16,Switched over to bt and the wifi is terrible. It picks it up on devices for only a matter of seconds before disconnecting and re-connecting. Avoid as they dont provide you with the services you pay for but continue to charge full price for every month.
conor,United Kingdom,11/9/16,"The worst customer service that I have ever experienced.
I was with BT for about a year, I canceled my contract early because I was moving to another country. I was told that it would cost £74 to cancel my contract early but they ended up charging well over £100. They also overcharged me for several of the months that I was with them. When I was eventually able to get in touch, they kept avoiding my questions about the charges. I emptied my bank account so that they can not take any more money from me, since then they have reported me to a debt collection agency.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY"
monghung,London,11/8/16,"left taliktalk and joined BT phone and broadband service 14 months ago , what a big mistake , phone service was ok but broadband was poor , I got a normal broadband speed of 8 mbs from talktalk but only about 4 mbs from BT , but it was cheaper than talktalk so I live with it , but after a few months BT put the price up steadly , and the contract has ended I rejoined talktalk because last couple months BT has almost DOUBLE the amount I have to paid from £38 to £63 per month and also wanted £ 31 for the disconnection from BT .BT also said because talk talk did not inform them about the switch over so my account was still active , althought I did use their service I still have to pay 3 months rental charge. BT are conman wanted the steal you money , once joined your have to paid a lot more to get out. SO you have been warned .
M CHAN from London"
Stuart,Ayr,11/7/16,"For 6 months I have had issues with my broadband dropping out and wifi being unable to stream videos. Have wasted hours of my life on the phone to BT but cannot get by the call centre who are hopeless and keep telling me they have remotely solved the problem, then the same thing happens again.
When it works it is fine but the gauge of a company is how they respond to problems and BT have sadly failed."
stanislav,newham,11/7/16,"just to say
they offer vouchers that never come i was meant to get 2 sainsbury vouchers never happened!!!
try to call them or respond plain ignorance rest assured i will never sign up with them again, not for the service but fraudulent advertisement!!!!"
Michael Rhodes,Stoke Gabriel,11/7/16,"We upgraded to BT Infinity, but its no better than the ordinary broadband service we had previously. It provides a maximum speed of 21 Gps. This is fast enough in theory, but is insufficient to sustain for some TV programs, leaving us to watch a rotating circle instead. Very disappointing."
Christopher,Ilkley,11/6/16,Signed up in August 2016 to get fibre and phone on 28th September. Failed to install on that date but cancelled my existing service provider. Phone taken over with no broadband. Still have no fibre as of 6th November. Customer services are a disgrace and tell untruths. Sick of waiting for hours to be connected to customer services who then seem incapable of offering any meaningful resolution. Avoid at all costs as the company is in free fall. Taking on more business that they can reasonably fulfill.
Marc,Co durham,11/6/16,Went back to BT for the broadband and infinity wish I had stayed with talktalk. The router has no range unless it's a day old then quite good but as soon as that day is over kiss you're wireless goodbye the router might reach 3 mars bar lengths but that's about it would not recommend no customer service at all BT is a joke stay well clear
Steve,Aberdeen,11/6/16,"New HH6 delivered before activation,turned it on the day of activation connected straight away.Full 52MB speeds right from the off.No problems at all it just works."
Mai,London,11/5/16,
Juliette thomas,London,11/5/16,"I moved my busines to BT from a previous supplier but its the same lines anyway. BT are the most terrible company anyone can imagine. They dont know who we are, we have no customer number, we cannot log faults without it, we have nothing what we ordered and despite many emails to them and calls our phones and internet are on and off constantly. They even left my old number behind although many times I told them this was to be included. Despite emails from BT for our new system saying an engineer will arrive to set us and and hsow us how it all works we have never seen an engineer !! and we dont work. I should have checked the reviews before moving. But then the other providers out source to BT anyway. So a hopeless situation. BE WARNED. Keep to a mobile if your not a business and keep well away from BT if you are. They are too big to cope and most departments dont even ANSWER THE PHONE. If your lucky enough for them to answer dont expect any continuation of a conversation even if you have that persons number to call them back."
Seb Dean,"Nottingham, UK",11/4/16,"Switched from Sky to BT due to their claims of having the fastest speeds in the UK... Since then, the connection drops out completely around twice per week for no apparent reason... Leaves us with no Internet for hours at a time. The speeds are OK during the day (I work from home), but as soon as it hits 4pm they die a death. I'm writing this at 5.11pm and a speed test tells me I'm receiving 5mb/s when I pay for 50.

Would not recommend them. Customer services operation is based abroad which I wouldn't care about if I could get through to someone quickly, unfortunately you'll be on hold for 30mins at a time to get through.

Can't wait for my contract to end."
Helen manning,Norwich,11/3/16,
KDowner,Taunton,11/3/16,"I've been with BT Internet for over a decade and BT as a landline for 30+ years.. Never had an issue and always sang their praises to all my friends, etc...

But when they sent me the hub5, they asked me to return the hub3 to them for recycling, which I then did. But after about 3 months orso, the hub started doing random things, such as switching off randomly and more than anything, giving me the worst wifi signal ever. So I called BT and said here must be a fault with my service. So they ran tests, I checked all my settings and everything from my side was all ok, so they sent me another hub5 and I sent the old one back..

I received the new hub5, but pretty much had wifi issues since day1. I can't get signal in the next room and it's a normal house with normal walls I live in. If I'm on my phone and walk to the kitchen, the signal drops and I'm stuck on 4g. I thought it might be my phone, but it's doing the same on my wife's phone and my work mobile, all 3 mobiles are on different providers. My laptop and tablet do the same, they drop signal if I move away from the room where the router is.

I again checked everything in my house, but I don't have any interferences, as I don't have a wireless landline, I don't have any blockers anywhere near my rooms. Ie microwave or special remote controls etc..

So I bought a BT wifi extender for the other side of my house, but it never gets connection as it just cannot find the router at all, I know if works as it works fine when plugged into the main room with the router

So I contacted BT and told the hub5 they sent me also doesn't work and I asked if they can just not send me the hub6, as my friends use it and they (and me when I visit) have amazing signal even long into their garden.

BT then literally told me they won't do anything as I should not be using wifi enabled items as they will never offer assistance with wifi, the lady even told me that their adverts are rubbish and lie (I recorded the call!!!)

So I said could they send me he hub6 because all the issues I've had and I've been with them for such a long time and they said, not a chance. If I wanted it, I could buy it but they wouldn't help me (their actual words)

So I feel disgusted by their services and just plain rudeness of their staff.. I'm still contracted with them for another 5 months, but really don't want to keep paying for a service I cannot use as its **bleep** and a drain on my money and resources in the house.

I would get another router, but BT have made it so difficult for this to happen, as they lock a lot of features to prevent this.

I know it's only the Internet, but I make my living from it and cannot do my job correctly without it and it's stressing me out, I've already lost a customer because of lack of service..

I've been able to test a friends Hub6 while they were on holiday and the signal was amazing. Throughout my house and into my garden. So this proves that the issue is 100% the Hub5 and not my house or area itself. But BT are basicly calling me liar and do not care about us at all..

My contract doesn't finish until the 5th of April so I have to endur this rubbish for a while yet.. I have raised a claim with the ombudsman for help, as it's ridiculous..!

I'm so unhappy with BT"
Jodie,Kent,11/1/16,
Diane,Bury St Edmunds,11/1/16,
Bethany,West Midlands,11/1/16,"I never normally leave reviews but thought I must this time to warn everyone DO NOT BUY BT BROADBAND OR TV
I have never dealt with people that are so uneducated and basically do not have a clue what products they sell.
Broadband has not work properly since we have had it installed, they tell you that you have a 14 day 'cooling off period' where you can cancel your package if you are not happy what they do not tell you is that this 14 days starts from when you place your order so in my case it took them 3 weeks for an engineer to come out and get it all set up on which case my right to cancel no longer exhausts and want £900 to get me out of my 12 month contact.
After spending hours and hours getting through to someone on their customer services department I get through to India where they are reading from a screen and don't understand your problem - ""computer says NOOOOO""
I actually emailed them and now have a dedicated person who likes to call every week ""to see how we are getting on"" but not actually solving our problem""
They have determined that my broadband doesn't work correctly because of where the engineer has set it up - basically on my tv stand.
They have said connection problems is our fault and nothing they can do - but the broadband needs to be by our tv as it needs to be connected to our youview box funny how SKY do not have the same problems as BT.
But don't worry they are refunding me £11.60 as a good will gesture! My direct debit is now cancelled see how far they can take it for me to pay my bill when they have falsely advertised their services and have not resolved my problem
If you buy something from the shop that is broken you expect a full refund something BT do not understand!!!"
Steve,Birmingham,11/1/16,"Money grabbing is all they are good for. Poor speed, connection always disconnecting and tv programs buffer due to premium programs coming through the internet at poor speeds. To top it off when my contract finished and told them I was going to virgin they charged a fee of £31 to disconnect my broadband. Avoid at all costs. Even the money they give out for joining doesn't turn up."
Kristian,East Sussex,10/31/16,"The worst customer service imaginable.

It started with them sending the engineer round to install the broadband and TV on the wrong date on 3 separate occasions. When they finally got the date correct the engineer wasn't given the correct equipment to install the service I had ordered. This was topped off by them charging me for the 3 months between when I put the order in for the service and when it was finally installed and I was able to use it. This is something others I have spoken with have also been a victim of so be aware they should only be charging you for the time in which you have use of the services.

Once up and running the internet was slow and this also impacted their TV service as most of this runs off the internet. I was paying for Infinity 2 which they say will be up to 75Mbps and a minimum of 35Mbps in my area, however when I finally got round to testing the speed I was receiving 1Mbps.

This has now finally been fixed after a month with many, many calls to their customer service line and two engineer visits, one of which was sent on the wrong day again (luckily I was in on this occasion). The engineers are great and the second one has fixed the problem and it is now working correctly however the people in the call centre never call back when they say they will and when you call them they tell you you have to wait for a call back from the person dealing with your complaint so they just book in another time slot for them not to call you back in again.

Be careful to make a note of any calls you make and any engineer appointments you make and keep it as when I spoke with them about compensation the date they gave for the fault being resolved was 10 days before the engineer had been round to fix the problem.

After all of this they said that if I wanted to leave the contract I would have to buy myself out even though they haven't provided the service I had signed up for, I will never be using BT again and I would strongly recommend you consider another provider."
Terry Taylor,Birmingham,10/31/16,"phoned to cancel old contract. the Sales guy's crib sheet said, new hub, lower cost better service.
So like an idiot I accepted.
Infinity 2 Broadband.
they send me 2 new Smart hubs and 1 new Homehub5 and 3 freeview boxes.
maybe this was to commiserate me coz from the day they changed from old to Infinity 2, NO phone line, No broadband.
please pay us £130 for an engineer to visit ""in case you have built an extension and disrupted the cable""
Lol. WHAT?
3 months later, NO phone line, NO broadband, Many promised return calls from Customer NO shows.
The only way I could get ay proper response was to directly e-mail ""gavin.e.patterson@bt.com"" who is the CEO.
Try it, I can guarantee you will get a response from his department within hours.
Guess what they do? put you in the hands of the same team who crooked you in the first place.
Exceptional!"
Liam,"Roehampton, London",10/31/16,"my broadband was connected a month late after having to call them on a daily basis to follow up call backs that never happened, after a month and 15 hrs plus on the phone they managed to fix the issue. a few weeks later i recieved my first bill which should have just been the delivery charge fr the router, instead i was charged £81 (my plan is only meant to be £30) because another mistake that they have made. i am still in the process of chasing my money. After this horrible experience I will be leaving as soon as my contract ends and not coming back."
Ross,CANTERBURY,10/30/16,I wouldn't even give a star for the overall service. I have been with BT since beginning of September. It was the worst mistake going with this provider. I tried to save a little money as SKY was out my price range for the speed i needed. I have the 52 mbs but the actual top speed i can get is 33 mbs (being told this from the BT technician that came to my home) Since my package started i have not had a fully functioning service for longer than 3 days. They still have not fixed my problem as i believe they do not know what it actually is with a technician testing everything within my house i and every thing is fine and working other than the service BT provide. Each time i have phoned BT (around 15 times) no matter the time of the day i have an average wait time of about 40 mins and when i do speak to someone i believe there is a culture clash as there is no empathy or even a generally recognition of social companionship. I have tried to leave the contract due to their speed guarantee but they have fobbed me off with so much and it seems i am stuck in the contract as i can not deal with the extreme hassle of fighting them. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AND BE WISE
Samantha,Castleford,10/29/16,"Worst broadband company ever, internet constantly have issues with speed dropping and no service at all sometimes, phone customer service only for them to lie to you and say they will send someone to fix the problem only for no-one to turn up.

Dec,Derbyshire,10/28/16,"A Four Day Customer

Please excuse the saracsim, its a healthier way to express my anger than shouting at their dis-interested staff.

This is an email I have just sent there complaint department (not holding my breath)

Please send this to the relevant manager/ that manager until someone notices how the company operates with a four day customer and can come together with a resolution and a way of insuring this no longer happens with any of your new customers.

Good Afternoon,

I decided to become a BT customer regarding BT Infinity Broadband a few weeks ago. My activation date was the 25th October 2016.

The day before BT sent me an SMS Message advising me, my service will start tomorrow (25/10/2016) anytime up until midnight.

Upon returning home from work, my BT Home Hub 6 was there and I decided to set it up in case I was already activated. Seeing there was a solid orange light (connection Issue) I thought I would leave it. However I did notice my internet with EE had already finished (as I thought would happen). Come midnight it was still solid orange, I disconnected the Home Hub, left it 10 minutes, and reconnected it. Unfortunately with the same result (Solid Orange Light). I thought since it was now early hours of the morning I would sleep and see if I was connected in the morning.

When waking on the 26th October it was still Solid Orange, I disconnected the device (including the ADSL) and reconnected after a few minutes, Solid Orange still.

Coming back from work it was still solid orange in colour, so I decided to run a diagnostic test via my PC. it advised me after there was a connection issue and to call your service.

After multiple calls (your phone back service doesn't like my mobile number?) and a 36 minute wait I managed to reach an advisor. I explained the above issue and provided my details. they placed me on hold so they could speak to the 'Order Management Team.' I agreed to wait (14 minutes) I spoke to a gentleman (no name provided presumably from order management team) who confirmed my go live date of 25th October 2016 and then asked if he could place me on hold (5 mins). He came back to me to advise he needed to speak to BT Open Reach and asks if I was OK to wait again (3 minutes). He came to advise he was talking to open reach and will call me with 5 to 10 minutes. (Call length 1 hour 17 minutes).

He called me back within 3 minutes. The Advisor told me that due to a disagreement between BT (yourselves) and BT Open Reach (a separate contractor now), no engineer had come to my area at all to connect the internet. As well as this they would not be able to provide me a timescale in which this would be happening and a service could start. We agreed on compensating me for the delivery charge of the home hub (as right now its a plastic box with some lighting and a bunch of wires with no other use), plus no charges for the days I did not receive the service (understandably I'm not paying for something I am not receiving. We also agreed I would receive a call back the next day between 08:00 and 18:00, as well as notes being added to the account regarding the above issues within your company causing a delay in a new customer receiving a service.

The next day came (27th October 2016), and I received no phone call. So come 18:10 I called yourselves. I requested a call back (it still does not like my number, so I put down my partners). I received a call back 1 hour later. I spoke to a very helpful gentleman called Corey. I advised him at the beginning of the call I wasn't happy and told him that in a sec I will rant about the service I have received (I surprisingly did not swear). He was OK with this and during my rant could hear him taking notes (made me feel I was being listened too). he advised me he has requested a call back to me by 21:00 that evening but in case they didn't call, supplied a 5 digit text which I could text if I didn't get a call so they could chase this up.

Unfortunately again, I did not receive a call back that night.

The next day 28th October I text Corey's team as advised and I received a call within an hour, the call advisor told me that they have looked into the problem du to an issue with BT Open Reach I was not going to receive my service until at least the 1st November. I advised your college that in the last 48 hours, I have spent 3 hours on the phone, including 1 hour listening to hold music and an automated message (it's worse than what I imagine water torture to be like). and a further 26 hours waiting for a call back (your company name is BT - British Telecoms, and you cant even provide a call back, that's either disgraceful or a serious problem you need to fix). I asked to speak with a manager, the advisor agreed to this and placed me on hold (Again!) whilst on hold (please get more than one song and mix up your automated ladies voice for a bit of variation - maybe Jigsaw from the horror franchise Saw for accuracy reflecting your ability to help your customers) and then they just hung up on me!

I instantly text Corey's team advising all this and received a text to say they are speaking to engineering and would call me within 10 minutes... it took 4 hours and 30 minutes, to receive a text saying a new department would call me within 4/5 days and they had closed my case. naturally I responded asking for a manager from a relevant department to call me and that I was disgusted at the service.

I received a call back from a call advisor to tell me they were transferring me to a new department 'connection' department who would transfer me to a manager. when I got through I was told I would now not receive an update until the 2nd November, (within 10 minutes another day had been added!) I asked to speak to a manager and was flat out refused. I then demanded a call back from a manager, the regulator details for yourselves, and an email address so I could send this message. I was advised they couldn't tell me who the regulator was, they couldn't give me an email address but should go to BT.com for an email? (don't think that's going to help.) and finally I would receive a call back within 2/3 hours. however the fact in 24 hours ive been promised 4 call backs (I think it's 5 but im too disgusted with this service now to count), and finally when I said I wanted to speak to the manager the advisor disconnected the call. A) I wasn't even given a warning (again) for a second disconnection. B) I wasn't abusive, swearing, personal or direct with my (understandable and justifiable anger), also when I asked to speak to your complaints department your colleague refused saying there was no need as there is an open complaint and just kept refusing... WHAT IS THAT ABOUT!

Please can someone from a managerial position contact me before you close today from a relevant department to discuss and rectify this matter with a professional reason, such as an actual reason, not supplier (BT Open Reach) Difficulties. I have now been more than patient with the level of service (or none (not Corey's team, who have been fantastic)). If that manager cannot be bothered to deal with me regarding this issue then by veto I want it raised to there manager and so forth until this issue has been fully rectified and I have been compensated for the above issues.

An exceptionally disgusted and outraged (I don't even know if I'm even being considered a customer)Customer."
Ruairidh,Dunfermline,10/28/16,"Utterly useless. For over a year we've been getting in touch with BT to change the bill date to the 1st of the month, every time they say it's done yet every month without fail the broadband is cut off 2/3 days before the bill date. We get in touch again and some guy who speaks barely a word of English tries to tell us he doesn't have a clue (which I believe, don't think anybody over there does) Almost painful how bad BT are, nothing but trouble."
Christodoulos panayiotou,Sutton surrey,10/28/16,"I'm a partially blind man, I notified bt of this when I took landline a broadband, 1st they sent me the wrong router, then, they could not get me broadband to work, lost count of the times I contacted them, landline kept crashing , broadband would not work, they wanted to charge me over £100.00, to come and check my internal line, 6 months later it was their junction box at fault. Two years later and hundreds of pounds out of pocket, I have decide enough is enough, but leaving bt is another challenge. Crap crap crap Bt. Only interested in talking money, avoid like the plague."
Sophie,Reading,10/28/16,"BT are the absolute worst provider I've ever had to deal with. They frequently lie/ignore customers, don't care one bit about their customers and seem to go out of their way to make things more complicated than it actually is. The broadband service we receive is completely unreliable, when we've complained we've just had inadequate responses and our latest interaction with them has been q complete joke. We are moving house and all we want to do is move our account across (because we still have time on the contract so until that point we can't switch to another provider) but trying to get BT to do this has been an absolute farce. When we finally got a date just to have the line connected (and booked time off work to do this) they then changed the date to a later date. This means we have to rearrange with work and also means we'll be without internet for a month which we're still paying for! We will not be renewing our contract with BT and I'd advise anyone considering BT to think again."
Craig Courier,Lincolnshire,10/27/16,"Pathetically poor service, over 25 hours on the phone trying to get incorrect charges emotes from my account. BEGGED for somebody with the right level of authority to speak to me to reverse incorrect charges and the release me from the remaining ten months of contract. Nothing doing - silence. Complaint letters - unanswered. So, I cancel the direct debit and call ZEN (A++++ SERVICE!) to hook me up.

Then I get a response! And what a CRAZY experience that was. HELP!! They won't let me go!! SAVE ME!!!"
Alessandra Vilser,oxford,10/27/16,"I ordered my broadband 2 months ago, including installation, it took 4 weeks to get my kit delivered and BT then decided not to send somebody to install my broadband because i already had a socket in the place i moved in. After delivery, for 2 weeks the internet did not work and i had several calls with the ""helpline"" until they finally sent some engineer. Now, since again 4 days after the engineer was here the internet is still not working. I paid more than 50£ of phone bill for the ""helpline"" and am being told the line is still not working. I wanted to cancel after 14 days but was told to wait for the engineer. Now they tell me i have to pay !!300 £!! Cancellation fee because the 14 days are over although i pad already 3 weeks for internet which is not working. I wasted every day 1-2 hour on the phone trying to talk to somebody with no result, had to take off hours at work to wait for the engineer, cannot do my work from home, will getbtroubles with taxes becausei cannot do my online banking and ALL BT DOES IS TELLING ME THAT THEY ARE SORRY AND THEY WILL TRY TO FIX IT??? NO REFUND ON MY PHONE COSTS, NO REFUND ON MY HOURS OFSPENDING ON THE PHONE AND THEY REFUSE TO CANCEL MY VCONTRACT??? i have never experenced such bad customer service, normally i have been with virgin media and never had such issues. DO NOT GO WITH BT!!! Its a waste of money, time and nerves!!"
Natalie,Kilmarnock,10/27/16,"Have been waiting 6 weeks for broadband, original engineer visit installed hub but said there was something wrong with the outside cables, now waiting for someone to come dig up the pavement outside our house(supposed to be the 27th but no one showed up) Advisers seem helpful and will promise all sorts but don't actually seem to achieve anything for you. Honestly the most disorganised, incapable company I've ever dealt with. I don't think we're EVER going to get broadband!"
Noushad,LONDON,10/27/16,"I have been with BT for 10 years now, on their Unlimited Infinity 2 Broadband and Phone for £52 a month.

the phone is fine, and at the start, the Broadband seemed great. However,

Speed tests at bt.wholesale.com are always good, at around 75Mbps down /18Mbps up,

I am switched my provider with SSE at the moment. because of that same service cost just £21...very cheap saving over 60%"

Now they sent me a bill of £507 for early termination. so far I spent 3 Hours on the phone with 0845 number with no resolution. BT is a CRAP company DO NOT USE THEM even if you are desperate. My Advise is read the fine prints, take your time, have a written proofs, print a copy and save it."
Paul sutton,South wales,10/26/16,"BT,
When joining with them a fluent English speaker and understander, dealt with all the options. An initial thumbs up there BT. When we moved in, they were unable to provide the services on the day agreed, then when I called the helpline, it felt as if I was teaching an English language class via phone. It took them an extra 2 days on top of the month in advance to get my services up and running. But this could only be done with my telephone box dangling from my living room wall by the wires. I then find that SKY is a hell of a lot cheaper with more for your money. Then to add insult to injury, BT then hit me with a £31 disconnection fee. They say that it is a cessation fee, but I have to pay it if I wish to disconnect from BT. This was not spoken about when I went through the cancelling of the service. BT, such a waste of my time and money and causing excessive stress at the beginning and end of our time with them. Cheers"
Andy Anderson,Redhill,10/25/16,"I can only agree with all of the criticisms of the total service offered by BT. Unresponsive call centres, poor substandard infrastructure, unsophisticated equipment, poor selection of television channels and worst of all a broadband service which is an embarassment. Slow clunky - download speeds of a snail. Glad to have moved away to another supplier and would recommend potential new customers to have nothing to do with this poor company. The are only hanging on because of their BT sport package, the rest of the service is substandard and a joke (but not a joke if you have a contract with them)."
Dolly,Worcestershire,10/25/16,"I can see that there are ALOT of bad reviews for BT broadband and I pity you folks, however mine is a good one!
Set up quick, efficient - after an initial hiccup with the engineer (I called the BT help desk and they sorted it quickly)everything went well.
I think a lot of the bad reviews on here are from heavy users with multi gadgets but if you are light user (occasional browsing, shopping, banking and the odd download) then I would recommend BT's ASDL broadband service. I have just finished my 12 month contract, called them up and asked what they could offer me - I now have unlimited weekend calls on the landline (which I didn't have before) as well as unlimited broadband usage which will come in handy. I use the internet on my laptop and mobile. I now pay 26.99 per month including line rental - with no delay in cross over. It is for 24 months though and If I cancel it for any reason before the 24 months is up I do have to pay for the remaining months that I am contracted to (hey ho).
Despite that, if you are similar user to me then I would recommend giving them a call to see what they can offer you.
Yes my internet is S L O W (get used to the buffer ring if you want to watch videos! but for my usage it is fine (2-3 Gb per month)"
Russell,Lancashire,10/25/16,"The customer service from bt is some of the worst i have ever come across, tbeir phone manner was shocking when you could actually get through. They make it practically impossable to find a number to call and when you do find it get ready for a 30 minute wait"
Tom Pouton,Newcastle,10/25/16,"I changed to BT from Sky because of cost basically. The the package for the TV and broadband looked good on paper and I thought BT were a good reliable company.

HOW WRONG I WAS!

For installation I've had four different dates, only for the engineer to come out and fit the hardware on the original date I was given when I placed my order. I'm still getting text messages and emails saying that the engineer is still coming on the other dates as well to fit the hardware when the work has already been done! Also I'm being told that these appointments can not be cancelled and I need to be in my property when the engineer comes to let him in and see the work has already been done. Madness!!!

After all of this I'm still waiting for my TV and broadband to be activated. When I call BT I cannot get a suitable answer and they seem clueless. The whole thing has been a joke from beginning to end. Terrible service.

I WISH I'D STAYED WITH SKY!!!!"
Rob,,10/24/16,"Never even got to use the service. They took 5 days to tell me they could in fact not provide the service, and in the interim had taken money out of my account. I've been told I'll be refunded that amount twice and still no refund after a month. Staff are obnoxious and extremely unhelpful. Overall shocking."
Ms Berry,Chichester,10/24/16,BRITISH TELECOM has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The worst broadband reliability I have ever encountered. Do not choose this supplier. Four engineer visits and many many calls to customer service still result in my using a dongle to get internet access. RUBBISH
Alit,East London,10/24/16,"Hands down the worst, most incompetent, slippery company I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. Useless. They don't do what they say they will do and then flat out lie to you when you try to resolve the issues. Not only are they charging me for services that are not working, they are charging me for calls from my land line phone which does not even exist. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
neil,s-on-trent,10/24/16,"have 2 e/ms from bt,==(1)we have changed your order 92) delivery on 16/09/16.i never asked them to change the order,they are now saying I was up and running on this date 7 have billed me for this ,I was not,up and running.i spoke with ''Lisa'' in India on,21/10/16 who informs me that I DID cancel my bt (''BULLING THUGS'')WITHIN THE 14 DAYS ALLOWED.She says someone from cancellations will be in touch with you.==I BET THEY WILL NOT BE INTOUCH.WHAT THEY DO IS NOTHING SHORT OF FRAUD AND THEFT==I WOULD BE HAPPY FOR ANY LEGAL ADVISE.THE GOVERMENT OR MY MP.

Jo Jotischky,Richmond,10/24/16,
Martin,Bedford,10/24/16,"I have been waiting over a week for BT to get my broadband up and running. I have called them 3 times and, first of all they managed to get the landline working but not the broadband.
The next two times the Indian call centre people told me to wait until midnight and each time there was no difference by the next morning.
Finally, I called to cancel and they asked me to give them from Saturday until Monday to get BT Open Reach to fix things (do I care whose fault it is?).
It didn't work so I have cancelled the contract.
I would have stayed with Virgin if they also operated in the area I have moved to."
Dave,Near Alford,10/24/16,"Awful broadband, usually at ""dial up speeds"". Why should we pay the same as others who actually get a service!"
Jean,York,10/23/16,"Appalling customer service. I ordered broadband, TV and line rental as a new customer They took £69 from my account and after 3 weeks of lies and broken promises of connection dates, nothing has happened Still tryng to get my £69 back. DO NOT USE!!!"
Clunchman,Kent,10/22/16,"Help line is useless. Their desktop help said Home Hub defective but they would not replace it. I got a router from elsewhere and now Broadband work.
Leaving BT and they try scare tactics to try and make you stay threatening £200 fee tat they are not entitled to. Bring it down to £70 by 'phone, but will text, E-Mail and send a letter for £200.33 but will not send anything saying £70. Awful company and I want nothing to do with them. NOT recommended.
BB advertised at about 76mb, I got 34.5 that with Infinity 2!"
Heather,Yorkshire,10/22/16,Having a really bad time with bt at the moment. My bills were £70 a month never use the house phone was on unlimited wifi also caller Id and answer phone. So asked why bill so much she said I hardly use data so go onto 25gb a month as was only using average of 5gb well said ok so new contract what a surprise after the 14 days I gets email you have reached your data allowance that was 15 days. So i rung they said must be us so the next month first day we were away and amazing we used 11gb no one home but still must be us I have been trying to sort this now since mid September I want to leave but must pay them £350. Disgusting.
Elaine,Leeds,10/22/16,Customer service is awful. If you start a chat be prepared to wait a very long time and for your question to fail to be answered
Matthew,Leicesteshire,10/22/16,"Where to start..

BT Customer service.. SHOCKINGLY BAD!
Got my broadband installed on 30th september! From day one! Nothing but problems.
Random disconnects.. slow speeds unless i suspect use there BT speed tested.
They sent an engineer with the standard threat of £130 charge if they found no fault.. engineer arrived, to find it WAS NOT WORKING and left with ""NO IDEA WHY"". 5 days later they sent another engineer who found the fault to be a port with the openreach exchange.. but get this..

Because i threatened to leave BT. Openreach told him he was not allowed to change the port i was on!
Luckily this was all within my cooling of period.. so i told them to get lost!
Honestly the worst company i have ever used!
Not saying that Virgin are any better (The only real alternative) but at least engineer visits are not charged & the connection tends to be stable!"
Christine Cranley,Woodham mortimer,10/21/16,"Speeds 0.2 , intermittent service, problem since July still not resolved. Very dissatisfied"
Lois,Guildford,10/21/16,"Total rubbish. Small bungalow but can't get wifi in my lounge or kitchen. Replaced home hub. No difference. Complaints said they couldn't guarantee wifi service only broadband speed. When questioned about the latest uk ad stating up to 300 metres wifi the Indian lady told me to read the small print! Really? Asked to speak with management and not available. ""Shall I close the complaint""? No, it has not been resolved. I can expect a call every night until it is resolved. Yes that's fine. Will I be taking it to consumer complaints? Most definitely."

Spent over 5 hours trying to resolve over last 3 days and just been told will not be connected until 26th October - 8 days late! Appalling service, and manager put down phone when I complained. BTCare on Twitter just refer back to online agents so you go round in circles. Wish I had never considered BT and looking at how I can cancel my contract."
JB,Manchester,10/20/16,"Worst customer service I have experienced. We have been without internet for nearly 3 weeks now because they are incapable of getting our broadband right. All we have done is move house (4 doors), we didn't even want a new router we were happy with the one we had, but BT told us we would be upgraded to Infinity. The customer service team are shocking. We have made various phone calls and web chats, have been pushed from Pillar to post getting nowhere. Our phone bills are huge due to data use from not having no wifi. A manager/ someone in charge was meant to call, we were told it was going to take 2 days for them to call back and we are still waiting for that phone call. Will never be using them again!!"
Anna Macdonald,Coventry,10/20/16,"BT is THE worst broadband and wifi provider. We were without broadband and wifi for 3 and a half weeks and were on the phone to be for hours because we couldn't get through and we'd be put on hold for up to 2 hours every time. BT would happily quickly get in touch when they hadn't received payment even though we hadn't got anything received any broadband or wifi within this time. It has been the WORST customer service my family has ever received. I would not recommend BT to anyone, 100% going back to sky we had no problems with them."
rachel,Sutton Coldfield,10/19/16,put a order in 4 1/2 weeks ago they came the first time on time although we could not find where the wires entered the building fair enough this wasn't either ours or their fault. We got in contact with the landlord of the property to find out where and got that sorted so WE rand back a few days later I say we as BT did not get in touch after Outreach couldn't do the job. I rang and they said I had the wrong address apparently I should be living in the Isle of wight not the midlands. got put through to the manager who said he had sorted it out he put records straight and made another appointment with Outreach to come out the following Monday when we had arranged to have the key from the landlord. They came out the Friday before when no one was at there my son was in lectures at Uni this is his flat he is in his last year and needs the internet for his dissitation. The engineer rang me and I told him I we had been told he would be there on Monday and we had arranged for the key to wires to be there on that date. Monday came no engineer so we rang BT they rang outreach no appointment had been made for that date or so they say. They made another date for the following Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning came and went no engineer so We rang again they rang outreach apparently the engineer was running late. but my son had to do some shopping which I said I would do he also had to go to a meeting with university Officer training corps UOTC at 4pm he was fuming and quite rightly so. anyway I pick up his shopping and go over to take over from him. There is an Outreach van there I speak to the engineer he was working at a neighbour Id just missed our engineer I should ring BT and they can ring the office to get him back my son was in the building he had the key i can't get in without it. I go into the flat and ring Bt the woman refused to ring outreach as I did not have my account number but my identity could have been easily prooved once the call had been made also their are other security questions the could have asked which were set up on making the order. She put the phone down on me when I asked for the manager the one who supposedly made an appointment for the previous Monday. I rang My other son turned up also at University with his phone so I asked him to get up my Emails to get my account number and I rang them again they asked my name I told them they told me they had no account in that name so I told them my account number they said that was a false account number all their account numbers begin with GT and not BT which is what my a Email said it was. he then listened to my story and I asked him if he could ring outreach he told me he didn't deal with broadband only broken land lines yet it was the same number i'd rang before all this took an hour on the phone he said he would get me transferred to someone who could help but he was busy so it couldnt do it for 1/2 hour there is about 5 min wait for me to ring. So he said he would ring back I said with 5 mins he said 10mins so I waited someone rang who was prepared to ring Outreach to ask why he had not rung the bell she asked for my name the address twice telephone number and my account number which suddenly was the correct one and my security question by this time My son had missed his important meeting with the UTOC he will now be in trouble. by this time of course it was a whole 2hrs later and getting dark of course the engineer wasn't going to come back. I felt like the whole of the customer service was having some kind of sick joke with me. I am sure this not the first time this has happened. It is like some one is trying to sabotage A good old British firm needs looking into by some one

Activation supposed to happen on 14/10/2016 and still nothing on 19/10/2016 with no answers.

Indian customer service lines, on hold for at least 30+ minutes a time, no answers or explanations, always fobbed off with ""we'll investigate and call you back"" but never receive said call-back.

Can hardly believe that the company has not shut down, operating the way that it is.

Would never recommend and will be cancelling contract.

Can't comment on broadband quality, as we never actually received any."
Matthew Burns,wimbledon,10/19/16,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS
Choose BT if you like to spend hours waiting to speaking to customer support for a service that does not work.

It has been 6 days since my BT hub arrived. It didn't work, and after all of the manual trouble-shooting I called up BT customer support. In total, the communication took 3 and a half hours.

Their option was to send an engineer. After questioning, this would set me back £130, despite the £55 I had already spent on delivery and set-up of the hub. The engineer would take 2 days to arrive, does NOT do evenings or weekends - meaning me working from home with no internet....

The next day I receive a call, they've looked into the problem, and think it's due to external wiring. They will send an engineer externally, and text me with the result. 3 days later, I have received no text so call them up. Their solution (with no explanation for what the engineer) was to send a new hub,

The new hub does not work again. Their solution - to send an engineer again (costing me £130). When can he arrive - FIVE WORKING DAYS TIME.

I say I want to cancel. It's too late in the evening for me to cancel. I make a request for somebody to phone me the next morning. Nobody phones. I call them... twenty minutes later, I am still on the phone."

Plamen G.,Bristol,10/18/16,"This is the worst ever ISP (internet service provide) that I have had since 2003. Worst ever customer service. Worst ever order management. Worst ever technical execution. Worst ever liars when it comes to explanations why they did not do what they had promised to do. Worst ever incompetent technical staff when it comes to telephone number managements. Please read on for a substantiation of these statements. Here is My story:

I placed an order to BT on the phone on 14/Aug/2016 for a telephone service, broadband, BT TV and BT Sports. The customer adviser promised that I would keep my existing telephone number, that the service would start in 7 to 15 days time and certainly by 30/Aug and that I would not be without a telephone and internet for longer than 4 hours, and at maximum only 24 hours. All these promises turned out to be empty words -- it is now 63 days later and I have been without internet for 35 days (and of course also without BT TV and BT Sports too -- these were never delivered). And to add insult to injury BT have changed my landline telephone number to a new random number -- I had had my old number for 15 years and all my friends and relatives have that number. However, BT despite actually promising to keep my number (they had promised this in writing) changed my landline number without any warning to me or consent on my side.

So, after placing the order on 14/Aug, nothing happened till 01/Sept except that BT cancelled my order without any request from me, without any warning to me or even an explanation -- just an e-mail that BT had now canceled the placed order. That's it -- simple and plain. Upon calling them on 01/Sept they explained that they had to canceled the order due to an internal system error in their order management system for which they had to apologize terribly and profoundly and then they promised that they would now recreate the cancelled order and start providing services by 14/Sept.

I wanted to speak to BT Complaints department and explain that I had not waited for 17 days in order to be told that BT had done nothing at all for this time and that I needed again to start from zero and wait for another 14 days.

However, there is no Complaints Department in BT -- a customer can only call and complain to the BT Order Management Department, which is the same department that mismanaged my order in the first place.

As an additional aggravating factor, the BT Order Management Department is located in India and there they do know a trick or two on how to deal with the customers, here is a verifiable list of such tricks (I had other tricks played on me, but I do not remember all of them):

(a) they places you on hold and then quietly hang up;

(b) they say that they will put you through to the ""Customer Options Team"", but all they do is put you to the back of the calls queue to their own department (the BT Order Management Dept) and you simply wait on the line for another 15-25 minutes in order to speak with another adviser from the same department and be asked to explain everything again and again;

(c) they say that they will put you through to talk to a manager, since your case is so serious and urgent, and then they simply leave you on the line to listen to a ringing tone for 20, 30, 40 mins or until you despair and hang up;

(d) they say that they will need to discuss the matter with someone else, who has the authority to resolve your problems immediately, and they promise to call you back within not more than 60 minutes. Then they hang up and you are left waiting in vain for 60, 120, 180 minutes for them to call back, but they never call back, not even 2, 3, 4, 6 days later.

(e) they tell you that they have recorded your complaint and that a manager will call you after 7 days to discuss the complaint -- they set a date and even tell you between which times the manager would call. Only, no manager calls on that date, nor on the following day nor in the following 3 days. Upon calling them again and asking them why no one called they explain that they have no record of this complaint or of the agreed callback, but that they will now log this second complaint and a manager will call you in another 7 days time -- they set the date and tell you the times... you know the story by now: no one calls back on this second time too, not on the third time in another 7 days, not on the fourth time in yet another 7 days (this will now be 7 x 4 = 28 days later).

By 15/Sept nothing happened except that BT changed my landline number to a new random number (despite having told me in writing that they would keep it). Upon calling them on 16/Sept and asking for an explanation they told me that this was due to a system error in their BT Openreach exchange and they apologized terribly and profoundly for this and they promised to correct the error in three days time by 18/Sept. On 18/Sept BT changed my landline number to a another new random number but did not give me back my old number (which I had had for 15 years). Upon calling them they apologized terribly and profoundly, told me that this time they would correct the problem in three days time by 21/Sept. They also explained that my old number had not been restored because the first customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of the number, but that this time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully. Three days later, on 21/Sept BT gave me yet a third random number but not my old number. When I called them they apologized terribly and profoundly and told me that they would correct the problem in another three days time by 24/Sept. They also explained that the second customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of my number, but that on this third time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully. Another three days later on 24/Sept BT gave me yet another new random number but did not restore my old number. I called them again and they again apologized terribly and profoundly and promised... well, by now you know the story -- it was repeated no less than three more times before BT at long last managed to restore my old number (which I had had for 15 years and which they had changed without my consent).

Long story short, today is 18/Oct/2016 and I still do not have any internet, neither BT TV nor BT Sports. They are now promising that they would start providing services soon. Should I believe them? I should I call and tell them that I want to leave BT on grounds that for 63 days BT managed only to change my landline number to several random numbers but have not managed to start delivering internet? Having written this account of my woes (and now that I finally got back my old phone number) I think that I will go and check Virgin Media prices and give BT the ""end-of-line""."
Anjali Martin,North London,10/18/16,"Do not buy the SMARThub. The internet continuously drops out. BT do not care though they know about the design flaw. There is just a lot of faffing around on the phone that goes nowhere. The absolute WORST idea of customer service ever. I need a refund, so does everyone who bought this flawed product."
Gemma,Walsall,10/18/16,
Rob F,Notts,10/18/16,"In terms of the speed and reliability things are great. The problems with BT start at installation - They made a real mess of my property when installing. It then took hours of chasing to receive the incentives they advertised as part of the broadband offer (vouchers etc). Things then get worse if you ever need to call them to adjust anything in relation to your service. Their online customer service is appalling. After months of terrible service i decided to let my 12 month contract end without renewal, only to be charged £31 for the privilege of not renewing. Really would suggest avoiding BT even they have the lowest price in your area."
Jennifer Brooks,Oxfordshire,10/18/16,The customer service is outrageously rubbish. The case manager assigned to my case could not manage a booze up in a brewery. I have been completely let down my BT and my experience. I do not recommend to ANYONE!
simon,lincolnshire,10/18/16,"Tried to get on bt sports to watch a game but couldn't log on. Their technical advisor got me to try logging on several times over the phone. He then advised me I was locked out for 24hrs because I had (on his advice) tried too many times! They flatly refused to do anything more to assist me. I have since tried to leave BT but they are telling me I renewed my contract 4 weeks ago?!?!? and there would be large termination fees. This didn't happen, they are not forthcoming with any proof that it did but are refusing to let me leave. Customer service terrible stay well away"
Nicola,Cambridgeshire,10/17/16,"Switched to BT from Utility Warehouse using U Switch. All communication very good, emails from BT keeping me informed all along the way, equipment arrived when said it would, switch over happened on the day it should. All very good, nice and easy. Excellent Broadband."
Bob,Coventry,10/17/16,"Stay away from BY at all cost, customer service is a dirty word to this company, they 100% admit I'm being overcharged every month !! But after 5 months they have done nothing about it.

Shannon,Milton Keynes,10/16/16,"Very unhappy with the service I've received, my internet it so slow not more then one person can go on at a time, phoned up more then once to sort this but got a bill of 60 something pounds I refused to pay it! Due to not having the service I wanted and no one listening to me,nor helping, man said he will up grade it, if it is not better within a week call back but I got my internet restricted so cannot go on the internet rang them up once again, explained how annoyed I was that no one was taking this into inconsideration and helping but cutting it off and refusing to help untill I pay the now £100 , I asked everyone I spoke to would you pay for something that didn't work! They answered no but still tried to get my money.
Very unhappy.

NOTHING BUT MONEY GRABBERS!!!"
Jeremy Graves,Letchworth,10/15/16,"Hopeless customer service, good enough when it is working."
Rich,,10/15/16,We had no contact prior to the contract ending with BT so ended up paying a stupid price for what we had. All other contracts we have taken out have warned us that the initial contract is going to expire. After ringing their customer service we find out we have to pay a disconnection fee even though the contract has expired. Not happy about this and the fact that we were not warned the contract was expiring I asked to speak to a manager but this was not possible apparently. I have logged a complaint with them which I'm guessing does f all but worth a try. Don't go near them.
Diana,Rayleigh,10/14/16,"Terrible terrible mistake in choosing BT, broad band has not worked once since joining and will be a month in 6days since the supposed start up date. New customers considering them DONT the staff are rude and simply disconnect the phone line when they can't answer why the issue hasn't been sorted out yet or they simply transfer you back and forth between departments. Completely incompetent and lack of knowledge."
Phil george,Whitchurch,10/14/16,"BT Local office in Wolverhampton, are USELESS, do not get involed with them, they have addesd items to my bill, told me they would sort it all out but they never did, causing a massive problem of £4500+ overcharge."
Aimee,Altrincham,10/14/16,
eldridge,egginton,10/13/16,"where to start, I have so far spent 4 hours on the phone trying to sort out my broadband. Had a fault wit broadband on 22nd September, reported it, tracked it online and a date appeared that it would be fixed on the 28th. Evening of the 28th I called and after a long conversation and a few tests I was told it was my hub that was faulty and a new hub would be dispatched and be delivered by Friday 30th. Friday came but the hub did not, called them again and I was told it was not ordered but it would arrive on Monday. Monday came and first thing Monday morning two emails arrived in my inbox, one to say my telephone contract had been extended for another 12 months. Now I was not out of contract yet but it gets better, I was told that BT was sorry that I was leaving. I was back on the phone trying to work out how my service came to be cancelled. Nobody could explain other than a new provider was taking over my broadband, the obvious question was who was taking it over. Sorry we don't know I was told and we cannot stop it now so you will have a new activation date, Saturday 8th October. Next day(Tuesday a hub arrived), in the meantime I purchased mobile broadband to see me through. Well BT informed me via the same email on Monday that I will have to pay £65 because I came out of my contract earlier than the 12 months agreed.

I tried to find out how my service got cancelled but at the time of writing no one knows. Anyway, Saturday morning bright and early I was back on the phone to check it was happening. The first person I spoke to told me call back in 3 hours, after a few minutes I thought sod it they are incompetent, let me call again and make sure, it is Saturday after all it may well not happen. Next person on the phone said , sorry we do not do activations on Saturday, it will have t be Monday. At this point I was beyond angry and asked to speak to an English person, well a few minutes later a young man was on the phone with more bad news. Sorry there was a problem with your initial contract, we need to stop the service and start again. I thought, well if that makes it easier lets do it, so off we went, a new plan, new credit search and a new activation date and oh a new telephone number.

He very politely told me, ring back on Tuesday, speak to connections and we will get the date brought forward. So Tuesday I was back on the phone, again and again more hassle. This time I was told the order did not go through, give us 24 hours and call again, so I did, just to be told the same so I thought , ley me leave them till Thursday. So today I called them again and again the same thing, sorry there is a problem with your order, we need to place a new order, man, I had enough. Please put me through to cancellations, this was done, phone rang and rand and rang and eventually went dead. Yep it did, guess what, later I got a call from BT, thought OK maybe now I will get a result. Sir, she said we need to place you a new order for a new line as a line test showed no phone line at your house, it will cost you £130.I almost fainted out of frustration.

Guess what, this is not the end of it, wish I could write a blog about this"
Gary,Cheshire,10/13/16,
Mr. Smith,Cambridge,10/13/16,3 months now with BT infinity. Cannot get signal round the house despite their stupid advert on TV. Internet drops almost daily (not according to them) and modem constantly needs re starting. They blame the microwave!!!! modem is 40cm from my laptop so no interference. Can get engineer out but if they can't find a fault then I will have to pay £129 added to my phone bill. 9 more months and then I'm out....
Matthew,Burns,10/13/16,"I strongly advise against using their service. Poor customer service and a complete disregard that people have jobs to go to, lives to live, and generally would like an internet service in their home:

My broadband hub didn't work when I set it up. I followed all the instructions and troubleshooting, even taking apart the phone socket. There was no more I could do.

Their engineers (which actually are not their engineers) only work 8-6 M-F and come with a £130 fee, which is on top of the standard £50 set-up fee.

The customer service lady lied to me about being able to use the BT Wifi-FOM service for the weekend I'd be without internet. Unless you live in a shopping center, this service is not available.

Avoid. The cheap monthly rate will increase, and your savings will be off-set by the set-up costs."
donrob,manchester,10/13/16,what a shambolic company long wait on phones so many departments to deal with. poor information given
H Baker,Gloucestershire,10/13/16,"Speed is often around 31 can get 40 in the middle of the night. It is now 6.30 am and speed is 24. What happened to the advertised 52? Speeds have got slower through out 18 contract. Very close to exchange and junction box. They keep putting up the price so while I contracted for about £18 it is now £26 I think this is a travesty on an 18 month contract. I cannot get out of it, but they keep increasing the price. FON good. Customer service appalling. Cut off my internet all together when switching to Fibre. Took me many hours of chats and phone calls one of which they charged me £26, Getting past their voice activated switch board is a nightmare. You have to hold the line and make no noise and it reverts to a key pad operation, But do not even breathe, Talking to India mostly incomprehensible. Chat understandable but they have no authority to do anything, I hate BT with a vengeance after 45 years as a customer the last 18 months have been a nightmare. Their India operatives have no knowledge of basic uk commercial law, They have been overcharging me for 18 months. Fon and BTwifi when out is excellent."
Stefan,Brighton,10/12/16,
Danny,Kent,10/11/16,"The worse service I have ever had. Started with a missed engineer appointment and has just gone down hill from there! Customer service team is non existent and 2 months after placing my order I finally have my service up and running! I've been transferred to their non UK based call centres more times than I can remember and have had the phone put down on me twice. I've had promises of calls back and no one calls and I've had my broadband delayed on numerous occasions without being told. Ongoing complaint with BT and trying to speak to them is impossible. When they do call me they are dismissive and for the missed appointment, which I took a day off work for, they offer me an offensive £10 compensation. I was with Sky for 5 years before BT and although they were not perfect I can see now why they are worth paying the extra!! If you are thinking of switching or joining then don't!"
Jane,Bury,10/11/16,"First off, Internet and product fantastic, no problems. CUSTOMER SERVICE NONE EXISTENT. Moving home in 2 months, wanted lines setting up in new prop before plastering and decorating. Guy said yeh no problem £50 for an engineer. I will call you in an hour to book a day. Call was never returned, neither have the last 6 calls. Over 5 hours waiting on the phone and now Im told that it wouldn't be £50, it will be £180!!! Absolute joke. Appealing customer service."
Maureen,Gwent,10/11/16,I wish I had stayed with SKY. I have issues every time I use it it says No Internet Connection despite troubleshooting all the usual things it just comes back when it feels like it. The first time it let me down I phoned BT internet helpdesk and I was on the phone for over two hours and no one helped me. Dire service and I wish I'd stayed with SKY and their service was bad.
Spike,Yorkshire,10/11/16,"Broadband stopped working a week ago, I logged the fault. I booked an engineer who visited a week later (this was the earliest appointment available). The engineer said the fault was the Hub. I have been with BT for a number of years but in the last year I have had to call them out on 4 occasions. I have been paying for a service that I received in the last year only 76% of the time making a cost loss of £156. When I informed BT that the Hub was faulty and could they send a replacement I was inormed ""certainly we will bill you £7.95 postage oh and by the way you can have a cheaper package as then you will have signed a new 12 month contract to get the Hub"". I responded that this package was the same as a current Sky deal but more expensive and also why would I want another 12 months of paying for a service that I was not getting? This was met with silience and needless to say I have taken the Sky deal. I am tired and frustrated with Bollywood Telecom's call service and being fobbed off with excuses. What BT should be doing is rewarding loyal customers and not penalising them. Unfortunately I have to give them 1 star to publish this review, I do wish review boards would work on a minus system."
Cj,Essex,10/11/16,"Aghhhhhhhhh.

I apologise for the manic outburst but I have just been trying to get my BT broadband upgraded for the last three weeks, only to find I am now back where I started from!
I am afraid to put the details into words in case it finally pushes me over the edge and I think I know where my wife has hidden the axe!"
Adam stevens,Stafford,10/10/16,Absolutely ridiculous. Couldn't understand English and certainly didn't speak English. Would not listen to me and hung up
darren morrison,manchester,10/10/16,Rubbish rubbish rubbish still waitin for a complaints manager to speak to me been over 2 weeks now so many problems with broadband tv monthly fees etc anybody thinking of switching to bt forget it!customer servuce non existant cant wait for my contract to finish absolute crime bt should be banned from advertising im paying for a service im not getting quick enough to get in touch when you dont pay your bill though
Maggie,Derby,10/9/16,"Well, where do I start. I signed up with BT back in May 2016. I signed up for internet and phone and accidentally accepted tv and sport. I cancelled the tv and sport the next day which I was told that it had been cancelled. It was going to take up to 2 to 3 weeks for my lines to be active. I received the modem no problem. However, when they said it was active, it wasn't. I called and found out my tv and sport was still active....strange. it gets worse!

I then checked my online account and seen a bill for £117 for canceling the tv and sport. They said there would be no charge.

A week later I still had no internet or phone line. They said all was ok on their side but a problem was on our side!! I later proceeded to cancel and was told I would get a cancellation fee of £220. Anyways ill come back to BT soon.

I signed up to plusnet and got active when they set the date. Guess what! Same BT line and no problems or repairs were made!!!

Back to my BT experience. I received another bill of well over £200 and its now £460. I spoke to a manager and contested their fees. Guess what! Even after I cancelled it was not!! He then explained that he had cancelled it and will reduce the amount due to poor customer service and late cancellation.

He said I should have accepted an engineer to come out but would have to pay £116 if the problem was on my side. I told him that plusnet had taken over and no technical issues were present. He just ignored that and said I still need to pay. Madness!!

I have now received a final letter of payment saying debt collectors will get involved if I don't pay! Also my credit history will be effected and or even go to court!!

My opinion to all new internet users. Do Not Go To BT!! I I'm stressed out due to this experience and have no other choice but to seek legal advice because I'm not paying for something they did not provide!!

Take my experience as a warning!"
MikeCrom,Tarporley Cheshire,10/9/16,"I have been with BT for 34 years but have to say, these days they are the most incompetent organisation I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. I won't go into detail re my specific problem but I will say this. It is causing me significant stress and inconvenience yet they continue to break promise after promise. One day this will all catch up with them but until then all we can do is expose them via excellent platforms such as this."
Bill McDougall,Weeton,10/9/16,BT MUST be the worst company in the world when you have a complaint. Total lack of customer service and if they want to test my line ever again and thank me for my patience I shall scream!
James,Manchester,10/9/16,"Speed is 1mb and paying for 50mb.
On hold for over an hour several times only for staff to hang up or try to fob me off to other departments.
Really regret signing up, avoid!"
Daniyal Irfan,Manchester,10/7/16,"Took over a month of delays to get an engineer over at which point I decided to cancel the whole contract because this pathetic company can't manage time or appointments, made me pay over 40 pounds in the mean time buying wifi for my devices through my phone carriers. What a joke. Do not recommend at all."
Kevin,Bath,10/6/16,Terrible terrible internet. the ping chart resembles a roller coaster - biggest and the most qualmish you've ridden. The connection drops on peak times and takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 hours if not more to come back. impossible to stay sane.
Sean,Thatcham Berkshire,10/6/16,Isn't it about time that the poor service from BT was brought mote out into the open? I have had no BT sport for five weeks now. I raised the fault three times after waiting on the line for hours only for the fault to be closed without it being resolved. Finally after shouting down the phone to a woman in England she arranged for an engineer to call today. Guess what - no show! Rang BT YET AGAIN and he said he was on his way. Never arrived. Any other company would have gone bust by now. Can't cancel without paying a ridiculous termination fee. Absolutely disgusted.
ian taylor,station road woodmancote cheltenham,10/6/16,"Pretty awful service.Constantly
disconnecting. Cannot use catch up TV even using Ethernet sockets."
PhilB,Crewe,10/6/16,"Useless.....internet is that slow that I am unable to use it. Only just signed up so unable to cancel it. Phoned customer services and a complete waste of time. Would never go with them again, any other provider would be better"
Andrew,Folkestone,10/5/16,Absolutely useless. Added line entries without consent. Spent 30mins trying to get it cancelled. Told default was that it was added if they didn't hear from you. How can that be correct. In process of changing line rental and provider. Will not use BT again. EE just as bad now they have merged or whatever
Helen,Newcastle Upon Tyne,10/5/16,"Over a year ago, we started getting problems with our internet constantly losing connection. 9 months later, and 20+ engineer visits (one of which we were incorrectly charged for! £100 taken out of our bank!) we were told there was nothing they could do. We were actually told we should move home.
Guess what? We moved home. The internet is even worse. It gets up to 3.5Mbps, but spends most of the day lounging at 0.1Mbps. Unusuable. I've tried to get BT to listen, but they only seem to test it while the speed is decent, so they won't believe that there is a fault. I've been promised call backs that never happened, and the faults/complaints I raise are closed without being resolved, and therefore never get escalated.
I honestly wish I'd never signed up to this terrible company. I rely on my internet for work and this is causing me considerable stress."
Jimmy,chelmsford,10/5/16,"I'll work backwards for this. Reliability, none, its the worst broadband service ive ever used, talk talk were rubbish but these have beat them hands down on rubbish reliability. Speed, the slowest broadband i ever used and im sorry i still say it shouldnt matter where you are in the country you should get the same service after all, you dont pay less or more based on post code. my nan works faster and she died 16 years ago. Customer service, no experience with this really as i get bored once ive sat on the phone for over half an hour waiting to talk to someone. Overall satisfaction, if i could give zero stars i would. i am going with another provider because of how bad these are so im out of contract yet they still want to charge a broadband disconnection fee. thats the best joke ive heard since i see lee evans live a few years back. BT promise all sorts and judging by these reviews and my experience i would stay well clear, well over priced for the lack of service provided."
Linda cull,Co Down,10/5/16,
aukse,london,10/4/16,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I've spent 2 hours on the phone with them and still wasn't able to sign up for a wifi. Apparently I was supposed to get my credit score check myself , pay 15pounds for that just to have my application refused. Would give 0 stars if I could."
Sark Edinburgh,Edinburgh,10/3/16,"Stay away from this company, DO NOT make the same mistake we did by switching to BT. Not only they lie but they also have the worse customer service you can imagine. Probably the worst company in the UK, if you switch just pray everything goes absolutely smoothly because I tiny problem will become massive by BT and their minions of useless customer service advisors that pass the buck from one to the other."
Toby Walker,London,10/1/16,"Tried to get through because my Internet is not working. After 30 minutes of endless calling tone and ""thank you for calling, we're very busy"" messages I had to give up. Enough to make me decide to take my business elsewhere. Unbelievably shocking service."
anon,kent,9/30/16,"I went back to BT; over and over and over and over again.... after deciding to change my contract with another provider, BT (mis)sold me fibre broadband. They enthusiastically (perhaps 'pushily') reiterated that is was 'Good news' as I have fibre broadband to my house. They cancelled my contract with my previous provider and rang me two days later to tell me fibre was NOT available. They then offered me a discounted copper broadband package, which I took only to find out that it would take a further two weeks beyond the original start date to install (a two week break in my service) and that it was significantly cheaper elsewhere. I then cancelled my order to receive an order confirmation text message inviting me to reply 'start' to confirm my order?!? I rang customer services who told me that it should be obvious that an order confirmation means a cancellation (the word cancellation was never in the text). The operative said that an order confirmation is 'semantically correct' for an order cancellation. Not in my world. It is comical looking back, but the fact that the call centre operative would argue with a customer in such a way means that BT are not worth my money, any day, any time, ever. After 8 separate phone calls to this lot I would say 'DON'T BoTher.'"
Anthony,Manchester,9/29/16,"Appalling service on broadband and tv. was told bt sport is free to view on the tv box. when I set it up its unavailable as my broadband speed is too slow. I have been mis-sold this product as it doesn't say anywhere bt sport depends on your broadband speed. when you phone up the call centre staff are rude and unhelpful, if they can even understand English. absolutely shocking service"
zaid,london,9/28/16,Worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. The connection is very very slow and constantly disconnects at random times when very important events are being carried out. This also happened at my last house when i had bt where it would constantly disconnect and i would have to restart the connection over and over and over untill my brain couldn't handle it anymore. The wifi is constantly slow and drives the whole family insane. Arguments and fights have arised from this dark connection that caused a violent plague to erupt in my household. Sometimes in the morning when i go to eat and McDonalds i take my PC there with me in order to recieve a taste of stable connection. Signing with BT was a fatal mistake that will daunt me till the day i die and I truly hope no one will have to face such a horrific experience.
David Jones,North East,9/28/16,"Recently I had a problem with my home land-line having a loud crackle and also broadband which kept disconnecting
The customer service from BT was appalling. Problem with their oversees call centres not able to understand me and vice versa
They told me twice that my fault was fixed, when it wasn't and had to start the process all over again
I have now given up on BT"
Sharon,Chester,9/28/16,"Having suffered several 'major outages' in this area over the summer, I made a complaint to BT. A few days later they called me back - to see if they could call me back in a few days time! By the time they eventually called me to discuss my complaint, we had had another 'major outage'. The customer service gentleman I spoke to had an Indian accent, but I wouldn't say I couldn't tell what he was saying. Mostly he blamed Openreach for the problem, but that is surely a cop out. If he was calling to deal with my complaint, surely that means that whatever arm of BT he worked for was taking responsibility for it. He also seemed to contradict himself over and again. First telling me he could give me a rebate on rental for the number of days outage, then saying he could not unless it was 5 consecutive days outage - which we had not had. I tried to clarify what he was saying, getting very frustrated that he seemed to keep contradicting himself. At the end of the conversation I told him I thought it very poor service that we had to be without internet for 5 consecutive days and that I would look for another service provider. We agreed though that he could close the complaint as we seemed to be going round in circles and he said he would make the rebate!!! I don't know if we are getting a rebate or not. I was left feeling very confused and frustrated - so much for customer service. He did however confirm that we are not under any current contract with BT so I told him I would be looking elsewhere for an internet provider who knows what customer servce means."
John smith,,9/27/16,Absolutely useless!!!!!! Took 6 weeks to activate. What a joke!! Internet speed not as fast as they guaranteed it would be and customer services couldnt give a flying monkey about there customers
Simon phillps,Banbury,9/27/16,"Awful awful ,only joined because of sky 12 month deal,oh dear , I live 300 yards from exchange, broadband will drop out at any time 3am,5.30 am 10.00pm,I cannot tell enough people how poor they are, truly deceitful company, anyone reading this, don't go to BT, awful service,awful customer care, laboured call times, truly awful"
Michael,Wrexham,9/27/16,"Every evening (around 7pm) speed drops from around 24Mbps to less than 5Mbps. Often less than 1Mbps. Usually back up to decent speed by 12am. Nothing different that I am doing so must be down to BT. As I work during the day, the evening is when I need the speed!"
Quay,"Chiswick/Acton, London",9/27/16,"Opted for fibre optic given long distance from Exchange but pretty diabolical all round

Pros:
Netflix works well (only tried in evening)

Cons:
- Consistent connectivity problems during the day (off peak!)
- Poor quality VoiP calls (mainly Skype)
- Incredibly poor support, helpline performs speed test and that is their key to connection being ok
- Any further support must be through their paid for service"
M,Devon,9/27/16,"Have been with BT since July !!
we have infinity which keeps dropping out wish i had stayed with Sky!!! will be gooing back after 12 months is up. Have tryed contacting customer services, over a hour waiting in a que they are a joke."
sandra amos,leeds,9/27/16,I have never come across such bad & unprofessional customer service.Ive spent hours on the phone trying to get my email address changed.I have been passed from department to the other .The English team are great the team of advisors abroad in India or where ever are diabolical.I wouldn't have anything to do with BT ever .avoid like the plague at all costs .
Henry Porcher,Oswestry Shropshire,9/26/16,"I have what BT jokingly refer to as high speed fibre broadband.
I live less than 3/4 mile from one of the most modern exchanges in the north west so theory is a good short run connection.
the funny thing is when we made an upgrade 3 years ago the engineer had a problem locating the distribution box. this was eventually located about a mile in the opposite direction. This is probably why the service is so abysmal as we may have (some doubt about that) the fibre optic to the box but then we have about a mile or so of Victorian copper cable thereon. Says it all for BT promises of better performance. Disgusted for £50.0 a month. As they say in Dragons den ""Im out""!"
Jodie,Canterbury,9/26/16,"Don't use BT, seriously. I've had the worst experience with BT, and although the advisors have been semi-useful, it's not good enough to compensate for the terrible service. To validate my claim:

I'm a student, this means that I need internet, particularly a reliable connection. I move into a new flat and ring BT and ask how long they'll take to get my internet working. I'm quoted 10-12 days. Fine, that's average, I can go that long on data, just. They check my postcode, confirm this and let me know that I can get at least 50mb in my area. I buy a BT Infinity 1 package. Super.

I get an email confirming that the hub will be delivered (c.£8) and the line will be switched (c.£49) in 11/12 days. Two hours later, I get another email saying that actually, it's going to be 21 days(!). The advisor suggests BT Openzone but there isn't one nearby, so they suggest that I get a MiFi data box for the time.

I buy a MiFi data box for £14.99 and buy 32gb data (there are 3 people in my household and this need to last 3 weeks) for £25. That's now another £40.

Finally, the hub arrives and the internet is turned on. Great. The literature that came with it says that it would take 3 days to settle, okay. After 4/5 days of terrible connection that drops out frequently and doesn't exceed 20mb (averaging at only 9.4mb) BT rings me because I put in a complaint about the wait. I explain how bad the internet is and the advisor tells me that it will take a week to settle.

I ask her about the 21 day wait, she says that I'm entitled to £14 compensation, but when pushed she offers me £20.

At this point, I've received my first bill and with all the charges it's over £80,and that's just my BT bill, it doesn't include the data I had to buy which pushes it to over £120.

Now I'm sat here a week later, a student, with a bill of £108 (minus the discount which hasn't actually been taken off yet) because of BT, after having to wait 21 days for connection. Oh, and to add insult to injury, my internet hasn't connected for the past half hour, even with resetting the hub twice. I'm writing this on Word ready to copy and paste if it does come on again, or for when I get into Uni-whichever comes first.

Don't bother with BT, if it's in your area, go with PLUSNET instead, faster/matched speeds, cheaper, and more reliable, it's what my friend has in her student house and what my parents use at home and they've had no problems.

Update: My bill is due tomorrow,before posting this review I thought I'd give BT one more chance. I spent 40 mins waiting on the phone. 30 mins waiting on a live chat, then later another 50 mins on live chat just for it to disconnect after I had told my problems to the operator. Useless."

Graham,Reigate,9/24/16,"Just paid for an ""upgrade"" which keeps dropping out. The customer care is the worst I have ever experienced, in any industry. The Outlook engineers have about 2 weeks experience each and are useless, literally. Even the BT engineers, who generally know what they are doing, cant stand them.

This dreadful company is a shameful example of what happens when there is no effective oversight. The fatboys at the top cream off huge salaries for no reason and no one gives a damn about the company. The board of directors should be savked for incompetency and the customer care should be brought back to the UK. I have nothing in principle against Indian call centres but the ones BT uses are utterly, utterly incompetent.

Probably selected for cheapness alone. What a truly dreadful, shameful company."
lister,bramhall,9/24/16,Installation puzzling end up installed where i do not want it. Was then told to install upstairs will cost me £120 / customer care rang twice both times I was cut off.

mike,wiltshire,9/21/16,they alter monthly payments without your consent so you wind up in debt 12 month contracts wind up as 9 month contracts without warning and I don't mean price changes when your with another isp and you have a speed fault like no usable service and you inform your isp they the report it to bt they in return say there is no fault after putting up with no internet for 3 months I phoned bt only to get the answer your not our customer so ok I cancelled my existing contract with my isp and joined BT broadband with a promise of 1.5mbs but when I connected up over three days of use the only speed I was getting was .001 mbs if I was lucky so there was a fault and my former isp lost a contract because of bt cheat also the speed that I now get is so say 5.8 mbs and yet if I connect more than one laptop or desktop the surfing use or bbc iplayer is trashed they then offer you infinity so you say ok then when you check the download speed from their cabinet the one you will bb connected to you find that the min speed is just bellow what your getting anyway I could write a book about the dirty tricks that BT use the sooner the government and local councils wake up to the useless service and con that BTopenreach are pulling with the grant money being paid to them to provide a superfast highway to the most populous users this area for one is not getting it their excuse is the copper wires my answer is what happened to the 21st century cabling promised by bt this was supposed to be completed years ago if we are on second rate cabling that provides a second rate service why are we paying a top rate monthly price for a second rate line that can't take the load. Ofcom should wake up to the ripoffs this company is pulling I could write a book of all the cons they have tried on me but the best is the councils and government are wasting tax payers money

Shaun,Deeside,9/20/16,"absolutely disgusting customer service, pushed from pillar to post, I have spoken with 6 different advisers today and only 1 could tell me the truth! that my order has somehow slipped through the net, after spending over an hour on the phone 3 weeks ago placing an order for tv and broadband and giving my card details, and to be told I have an engineer coming out. My appointment was meant to be tomorrow but I have had no communication from bt in the past 3 weeks so i thought id better call them to check as I would need to take time off work! after 1 30 minute live chat and 5 half an hour to an hour calls later they told me that there is no order for my address/name/contact details. Disgusting customer service, I was cut off 3 times and promised ring back numerous times which never materialized. I just cannot understand how a substantial order with a massive company like BT could go so wrong, highly dissapointed to say the least!"

Other companies I have been with would send reminder or continue with the package u signed up for. But instead , is ""ok"" and acceptable to charge u double of the cost you had initially agreed to!! It's like fraud!
Moreover, the line keeps getting cut off especially at night.
Not sure what you have been upgrading in your company!! Never with bt again. My whole family is leaving too! Generally an UNETHICAL company!"
Alan Daniels,"Newmarket, Suffolk",9/20/16,Absolutely dreadful. 0.44MB download speed! 0.22 upload? Our experience with BT has been uniformly poor. Never again. I am happy to walk away from our contract if I could be sure of finding a better supplier
Michael Walsh,Rochdale,9/19/16,"The broadband we get is very good. BT customer service however is beyond poor.

Issue started when I couldn't access BT sport through the app. Was told I had to ""refresh"" my package to reactivate. Told I would receive an email through later that day stating I had taken out a new contract by to ignore it. I did. No prizes for guessing that they had extended my contract without permission.

I have since had 7 calls with BT going round in an infuriating circle. Agreed new package, didn't put in place. When did charged me a sport cancellation fee when I was out of contract. On hold for 40 mins then cutting off (twice). Indian call centre with translation issues.

Eventually sorted the new contract only because they gave me 50% off & because the infinity broadband is God - otherwise would have gone elsewhere for sure.

Couldn't possibly recommend the company based on these awful levels of customer service."
Derek Barnes,Preston,9/19/16,"If I could have given less than one star for reliability and overall satisfaction I would have. Truly appalling broadband with signal drop several times a day, this was over a period of nine months despite numerous calls to customer service who claimed to have ""identified and fixed"" the problem. If it doesn't get sorted this time, I'm going to Trading Standards."
Dr Peter Nicholls,Canterbury,9/17/16,"Recently switched to BT broadband, and I have been totally SHOCKED by how apalling the whole experience has been. Mistakes in connecting the service, a router that doesn't work properly and terrible download and upload speeds at times when the ridiculous BT sport- which I do not want and do not subscribe to- is at peAk time for entertaining people in pubs who are sensible enough not to subscribe to BT at home.... For me, BT epitomises the worst of the UK- a post-colonial monopoly that thinks it is competitive because it is a private company. With such an appalling service, it would not survive in a truly commercial market like the US. A total farce, and one star is one too may in each category. I should have trusted my instinct and avoided BT like the plague instead of falling for the marketing hype."
kristian,norfolk,9/16/16,"I personally begrudge putting even 1 star this company has as many holes in its reliability as Swiss cheese the complete incompetence of its staff to communicate between themselves leaves you talking to a different person about the same problem repeatedly, from the beginning,. in my case every week for nearly four month. a two day fix is not justification for closing a complaint, which then has to be reported again. basically this company has got to big to greedy and basically couldn't give a £^%$ about its customers."
Prinsen,Lower Broadheath,9/15/16,Broadband speed is incredibly slow (1.7) and I would love to speak to BT about it but I don't want to waste another 2 hours of my life to try and get them to answer my call! I would love to switch but started our 12 mth contract with them 2 mths ago. Can we get out of a contract that obviously does not work for us?
Tony,Derby,9/15/16,"60 min wait to speak to their Indian Call Centre resulted in an engineer being booked to assess tv reception fault.
Advised I would be charged £130 if the fault was within the home. No engineer arrived in the 5 hour time slot. No explaination and a further 60 mins on hold trying to re contact the TV support line. This service is truly shocking. Best avoid BT."
Ahmed Razak,Bedfordshire,9/14/16,
Katy,Devon,9/14/16,"Worse company I've ever dealt with

After 15 years of being with Sky I moved to BT and I have regretted it ever since. Not necessarily the products but they are con artists!!!
I have been stung twice (stupid me) once was I was being charged wrongly for broadband so I called and then said 'yes I can see you have I can change it now'..... Didn't realise that meant tying myself in for 12 months for nothing.

And then same happened with BT sports I called and said on the phone there was a problem they said they can sort it- I replied with 'this isn't going to tie me into anything is it, I've been stung before'...... Got a no and then found out today it did!!!

BT found my call proving this was said by me BUT after the person recited there speel at the end of the call and I said yes to it, I was saying yes to tying myself in...... Couldn't make this stuff up.

What is disgraceful is I have no option to take this further without huge headache and it's not good enough from such a large company.

They should be ashamed of themselves!!!"
Paul,Berkshire,9/14/16,"Worse company I have ever dealt with in my life. Called them over two weeks ago to report a broken modem. I suggested it was the power cable not working, and i was told to go to my local market and buy a new one. After insisting they replace it, they informed me they can’t and would need to send me a new router and modem. This would be with me in the next 3 to 5 working days. Nothing arrived. Called them back, which took an eternity to get to speak to a human. They then informed me that the operator was not authorised to send me out the new equipment and he would call me back to explain within the hour. No call back so next day rang them again 50 min trying to get to speak to them. They then said the operator had tried to call me back on three occasions but my line was engaged. (I don’t use the land line for making calls) I was then told they would send me out the new equipment and I was given an order number. No new equipment arrives speak to them again and they say they have no routers in stock. But will call me once they have them available. Still waiting for the call back, so far 2 weeks without internet.
Don’t know who to speak to next as I can’t get past the call handler in India. Full of apologies and refuses to pass you on to a manager, but instead say they will email the manager and you will get a call back. Guess what… you don’t."
Anon,Brockenhurst,9/12/16,"Recently moved from ancient router to shiny new bt infinity as soon as it was available in our area. Supposedly creaky old broadband was 100% reliable. Supposedly much better shiny new infinity regularly goes offline in the evenings and sometimes during the day too. They forgot to mention that by ""upgrading"" we'd be degrading the reliability of our service."
Gary,Johnson,9/12/16,"Speed routinely poor, customer service disappointing."
sam,East Sussex,9/11/16,If you get a UK based call centre when you call BT then you will be helped quickly and professionally. If you get an Indian based call centre which 9 times out of 10 you will then just hand up because they are USELESS!! i have never had such poor customer service then when i call up BT and get an Indian telling me to do the same stupid speed tests over and over again when all i need to an engineer to come out. Absolute trash customer service (unless you get a UK call centre)
Fife user,West Fife,9/11/16,"BT are very disorganised, falsely reassuring and appear to be completely incapable of sorting out our very slow (phone line based) broadband. We also have BT line rental so they are responsible for it all and still cannot make anything better."
Michael Carroll,Bolton,9/10/16,"My daughter and I were both with BT for three years. Very expensive and customer service useless. When my daughter changed to Virgin they charged her $31 for disconnection. As a result I left BT as well, never to return."
James Thomson,Edinburgh,9/10/16,Absolutely disgusted with BT customer service. They have effectively washed their hands of providing a good customer service by sending it to India. I've been a loyal customer for 30 years and never experienced anything like it.
David,Glasgow,9/10/16,"BT are the worst Broadband suppliers I have ever had to deal with. For the past 6 months my internet connection has been cutting in and out. Any time I have tried to contact them they outsource the call to an Indian technical support office who have no idea what the problem is or we end up on hold for up to 3 hours before the call mysteriously drops off. Eventually we managed to get an engineer out to look at it, who told us that we had a line fault due to trees being in the way of the line. But the trees cant be removed until the line is first taken away so that the line isn't damaged, not only this but we had to get a new hub which after only 2 weeks of use has stopped working. BT still has not removed the line so that we can remove the trees safely.

GO WITH ANY OTHER COMPANY!"
Halle cairns,Banbridge,9/10/16,
John Hagger,CLACTON-ON-SEA,9/10/16,"I have been a BT customer for a number of years. Prior to this I was with AOL. I packed them up as I got fed up with endless calls from India (or wherever) trying to talk me into unwanted upgrades.
I am a fairly low user of both phone and broadband, but on the whole I have to say I have experienced few problems. I guess I am probably paying too much for the amount I use but, as the saying goes, 'If it ain't broke-don't fix it'.
After the first year, like most companies, they just throw you a few breadcrumbs to keep you with them. If you pay line rental 12 months in advance you save a few pounds, but at the same time, it locks you into them for the said period. They also throw in the number display and associated items worth £1.75 per month- big deal!
A friend of mine was with Talk Talk (I seem to remember). He had a fault that was found to be in a waterlogged telephone service box out in the street. This apparently comes under the jurisdiction of BT. He had an unannounced call from a BT engineer whilst he was out and (If I remember correctly) had around £80 added to his Talk Talk bill. They told him it was up to him to contact BT. He just could not be bothered- which made me a little cross at the time, but it's his money.
Hence I've decided to stay put- at least I know I just have BT to deal with. I can't substantiate this but I would assume that in cases like my friends situation BT probably prioritize their own customers.
Why it is called BT when the majority of their call centers seem to be abroad- goodness knows."
Romeo and juliet,London,9/9/16,"Customer service for technical support is a big FAT joke very rude, very racist! And unable to help dont waste your time no one will help. As long as the money is good for the company. What call center put you through to not help but become racist with names likes."
Rob,Solihull,9/9/16,"Very poor throughout, and it gets worse when your contract ends.

It is painful, and you will waste hours, probably 1.5 days being passed from one idiot to another, and they will keep trying to close your complaint.

Avoid at all costs"
Mohammed,London,9/9/16,"All i have to say is look at everyone's review. They have all pretty much stated that its terrible. They are trying for me to stay with BT and do not allow me to cancel for service i am paying for and not receiving anything in return. I have wasted approximately over 12hours i kid you not in this 5 days alone!

DO NOT BOTHER WITH BT AT ALL"
Lamorna Kirkbride,Cornwall,9/8/16,"Having had to spend 2 hours on the phone to this company I would not recommend them to anyone. Tried 3 times during the day to speak to someone but never made it through to a person . Then when we did make it through at 6 at night we just got palmed from department to department and 1 hour 35 of our phone call was spent on hold. After every month being over charged on our account we wanted answers as to why, after being told we had free weekend calls the lady we spoke to here basically called us liers and said this had never been part of our package. Her tone was disgusting and she was obviously out looking for an argument , one of the main reasons for leaving this company was her terrible manner . BT is the perfect company to be with providing you like to be overcharged on your account , pay an excessive line rental, pay in excess for using your house phone (19p to just connect a call) & want to be spoken to like crap basically , otherwise avoid like the Plague and go for a cheaper company that offers the same. Really disappointment with our treatment from this company shall be cancelling with them tomorrow."
Lisa,London,9/8/16,"Over 8 years with BT and eventually fed up with their over-priced poor quality broadband packages and the worst customer services so ever. The numerous issues with them from unshown-up engineering appointment, disconnecting broadband service in the old address without connecting in the new address for two weeks, customer services inaccessible most of time, up to an hour waiting each time for a phone call, made hundreds of calls to them in last two months but only got a few times to speak to someone, never called back as promised just waste time to wait, they are not interest in solving problems but in how to get rid of their responsibilities. What they've done made me feel that the staff don't care about neither their customers nor the reputation of their company. They just don't care! i was told that I have to pay £150 if I leave them after my broadband contract is finish because my landline and the hub will still be in contract, which is an absolutely joke because they came in the same package when we moved house last year. They don't let you leave even they don't treat you fair. The company is hopeless and don't understand that how they can still survive in the business. Made numerous complaint via online contact email and phone calls and eventually someone from the customer complanit review team contacted me regarding the complaints today! It is a nightmare which everyone should avoid to deal with them. I'm leaving!"
Alice NW2,London,9/7/16,"Switched to BT from Virgin as they were offering a good TV / phone / Broadband package. HUGE mistake. Signal incredibly weak and slow so paid to upgrade to a higher speed (£6 extra per month).

They say we can't be upgraded for two weeks. Spend two weeks with crappy internet.

The day of the switch, the internet goes down altogether. We call and are told this happens for a day as it switches around (thanks for the warning).

Day 2 - still no internet. Numerous calls to an Asian callcentre, no one can figure out what's wrong, no one will let me speak to a manager and the next time an engineer can come out is MONDAY (that will have been 6 days without internet).

Something tells me they either need to employ more engineers or run a broadband service that doesn't break down all the time. Having to wait until tomorrow to lodge an official complaint.

Absolutely appalled I can honestly say I've never had such bad customer service in my life."
Thura,London,9/7/16,Call back service never calls back. You get transferred or they hang up. Accounts are tied to copper landline nobody uses. No technical support is provided. Anything goes wrong and it takes weeks to resolve
Celine,York,9/7/16,
Sam,Cardiff,9/6/16,BT customer service is a big joke! The internet keep disconnecting in the past few months and it stopped working since 4 days ago. I spent 2 hours waiting on the phone and finally got someone to talk about the problem then we've made an engineer appointment on today but at the end no one showed up!! Then I contacted them again and they said I haven't made any appointment! They will call me back to arrange something tomorrow!!!!! That's crazy!
Trudy,Castlederg,9/5/16,
KB,London,9/5/16,"Unhelpful customer services, the company seeks ways to incur charges on every occasion. Example: agreed payment date for 29th of the month and on that date they disconnect services and add 12£ charge. When called up the customer services speak like politicians, no logic in it and talk to talk and waste your time."
Judith,London,9/4/16,One hour call back service is a joke. Used this service twice with no result - no one called. Then hung on for 55 minutes before getting through to customer services. Issue not resolved.
ian taylor,woodmancote cheltenham,9/4/16,"Impossible to watch catchup TV most days. Ethernet connection.
Often disconnects from internet.
Really disappointing service"
John baxter,Upminster,9/3/16,"Can't believe the difference, suffered BT broadband for about 10 years, now have basic sky, everything work as it should"
CJ,Weston Super Mare,9/2/16,BT have cut my Broadband for no reason! They admit it's their fault but after 2 days they don't know how to reconnect me!
Kathy,Suffolk,9/2/16,"Bt are an absolute joke!!!! I have been trying to get my bt infinity fixed for the last 3 weeks, you phone them and you're on hold for an hour + , even after that they transfer you to off shore fault team who have not have a clue, or just hang up! I've had 3 engineers booked. The first was sent to the wrong Address, which I've never heard of, second engineer didn't even turn up, third was booked , ( was told he was definitely arriving between 8-1) guess what???? He was sent to the wrong Address again the same Address as the first engineer!!! All I get is "" we don't understand why this is happening"". So phone bt for like the 50th time. I've now been waiting for two hours on hold for someone to answer the phone!! I will be cancelling Bt and demand compensation for time off work I've had to take for the 3 engineer appointments!! I'll never use Bt again and would advise anyone else not to go with them! The company is beyond a joke."
VALENTINA,Leamington Spa,9/1/16,
Mard,Coventry,9/1/16,"The absolute worst Internet provider in the world!!!! Do not get BT, always faults on the line, no customer satisfaction, do not provide the service the say they do, will increase prices without any warning, original bt router worked fine with WiFi until NEW router came out the all of a sudden WiFi signal was really poor ?? So you are forced in to buying new router, BT is the biggest con going, I will be taken them to court, please look at other review sites about BT 0.3 out of 10 !! Says it all"
Wayne,Essex,9/1/16,Customer service is non-existant would avoid at all costs. Reported a fault with broadband barely working 7 weeks ago and despite numerous complaints we have not heard from anyone except the odd phone call from India. Could barely understand what they were saying and still not fixed. Have tried to cancel contract and no response from that department either. Entire company a joke. Will be leaving and never using again.
feed Up,South Coast,8/31/16,"Works well in the daytime - sometimes!! but after 6.00 pm forget it, can't access most websites, e mails, or anything else. Told by BT customer service that with Infinity, that is due on stream next month, all our access problems will be resolved. Signed up, (probably the wrong decision) but we will see. At the moment makes me feel ashamed to have the British prefix attached to this pathetic service. Had better broadband speeds on a boat in the middle of Frace than we have here in the UK."
David,Kington,8/31/16,The signal has now failed completely twice in two months. BT took two weeks to rectify the first fault and two days to fix the second. The speed keeps dropping from 15Mb/s to 0.25. It is utterly unreliable.
K Lowry,Cheshire,8/31/16,"I am thoroughly fed up with BT's 'superslow broadband' I have been with them for 10 years but now I am looking elsewhere, Customer service,? WHAT customer service.? It took me 2 years to convince them I was paying twice, ! (I think this happened when I changed to their superslow service but they kept collecting for the old contract as well, I had 2 different customer accounts but the call centre just kept bluffing and blinding me with 'science' until one day they actually agreed and repaid (some) of the overpayments, If you want a homehub that disconnects 10 or more times a day, then BT is for you, otherwise avoid this appalling company"
AG,West midlands,8/30/16,"Worse customer service than the tax office! Impossible to contact and frequently cut off. Every time you try again, endless waits, then go through the whole situation again only to be cut off again. Website avoids giving helpful contact advice to the point of annoyance."
shay,london,8/30/16,"If you are contemplating taking any BT service please don't as you will regret it.
I have been having numerous issues with my wifi and all bt have been doing is fobing me off. I have spent upto 6 hours with clueless customer advisers telling me at the end of the call is call back next week. now if that isn't disrespect than i dont know what is."
Barry,Ipswich Suffolk,8/30/16,"Steer clear of this bunch of thieving cowboys.

Their customer service is worse than their very poor broadband.

I will use carrier pigeon before going back to this company"
Jason Moore,Northampton,8/28/16,"Stinking customer service caused me to leave BT, then they let out an even worse stink!

They had mugged me into restarting my broadband contract via my 'Free' BT sport renewal!

Just robbers plain and simple, I am glad to be gone"
Mr P.Hendy,Lazonby,8/28/16,"Our broad band service reliability is very poor as an example we have lost our broad band service 4 times today and this situation is not improving

Surely in this day and age broad band services providers must be able to provide a good and reliable broad band service at reasonable charges

Cartel marketplace springs to mind in our current customer broad band provision at this time

Opportunity for a good broad band service provider at reasonable cost would take a very high market share of broad band provision"
Mags Q,Burgess Hill,8/27/16,"Absolutely appalling 'super fast' fibre broadband and the worst customer service experience. Have had ongoing broadband dropping issues for 18 months since installing, dropping 8-10 times a day. If report fault online, it shows resolved in a couple of days but still dropping. To place fault via call centre have been on hold a minimum of 35 mins before speaking to a human being. Have now reported the fault 4 times, seen 4 engineers who promise ''it will be fixed today' then we never see or hear from them again. The most atrocious service ever. 4th engineer this morning confidently saying he'll fix it today. Came home at 4.30pm have no broadband service at all (bank holiday weekend), and have now been on hold for 50 mins asked not spoken Tia person yet. The online BT fault reporting website says we don't have a fault! Disgusted beyond belief that we're paying for this rubbish. The only plus side having experienced this, is that I procure telephony services for central gov depts, and no matter how good the sales people are, they won't be getting any new or repeat business as have seen first hand just how shocking their service has become."
s thompson,kings lynn,8/27/16,"the engineers have been here so often now we are on first name terms and have made up a bed in the spare room. They blame anything and everything, fix the problem, assure us all is OK, then 7 days after they leave, no broadband, t.v. service drops out, slow download speeds, same old, same old. The service is nothing like advertised and trying to get them to get an engineer out is like trying to find Lord Lucan!! Why do they promise what they know they can`t deliver?? Years ago we thought of car salesmen as the archetypical conman, it`s now BT sales and after sales service teams....problem is it seems, all other suppliers are just as bad!!"
Dave Rogers,Cheshire,8/26/16,"Long term customer and you get no favours for that. On the back of some email password sync issues I managed to get a ""deal"" for a better BB service. Should have kicked in days ago and hasn't.

The time I've spent using their online chat support service has redefined abject misery. It took time to even get a response from that but when I did I got nowhere fast. The emphasis seems to be on validating who you are, rather than resolving the problem. I mean who in their right mind would pretend to be someone else, and put themselves through the pain that this so called support service involves?

Without boring about details, I usually sit down with a magazine or such, because on average I spent over an hour, and most of that was just that, waiting. Occasionally getting responses such as ""hold on a minute"" or ""the server for that test is taking time"" or ""I'm just checking into that"". They are very good at apologising though. I got that a lot.

What has pushed me over the edge is being lied to by these people. I've got transcript evidence of 2, arguably 3 instances in less than a week where promises to email or call me back simply have not happened.

When it got to the point of agreeing an engineer needed to look at things I was then hit with what read like a legal statement about additional costs. Now I know nothing in my home is faulty but the tone of this was appalling and came across in a threatening manner. I firmly advised I will not be paying any extra to get the service I am now paying for. I'd add that the previous BB service I was buying NEVER managed 75% of its so called performance either.

Today I will be submitting a formal complaint. Whilst I would prefer to stick with BT as a 1 stop shop for my phone and BB, I honestly do not feel I am dealing with a company that demonstrates good customer focus, nor ability to deliver as promised."
ANDY,LARGS,8/26/16,"Had BT for 30 years then made the mistake of moving house. Filled in the order online with BT and was told at Midday everything would work in my new house. 2 weeks and 4 phone calls totaling 4 hours to India I got a phone Line. Broadband was another issue after a further 7 weeks and 13 calls to there call centers total 10 hours and every time having to repeat the same details I gave up. Called Sky and They gave me a date 7 days later all was working. Since transferred all my properties away from BT, nightmare."
Jim,Fife,8/25/16,We have had BT for many years. Poor broadband service initially was eventually fixed when they found the problem lay not in our home but in their exchange! Have had consistent 11Mb service with no dropping for years. Now considering moving to fibre but not sure it is worth it or that we will get a better service than now!
Gina,"Gayton, King's Lynn",8/25/16,"A much slower service than three years ago, but paying more. numerous calls go un-answered and problem ingnored. Very disappointing, but i'm just a small fish in a big pond"
Gilbert Small,Liverpool,8/25/16,"Absolutely appalling called BT to tell them I was moving home and they told me an engineer would be out to my PROPERTY which they never showed up so I called up to see what was going on an they told me an engineer doesn't need to be out when I had wires missing and I also don't know how set it all up, I explained this to BT for 3 days on the run and they sent me the same wire for 3 days. I really don't know how hard it is to send an engineer out to help a customer out!!!!"
Kevin Pellow,Lanner Redruth,8/24/16,"And absolute disgusting service pay for the full amount and basically get rubbish speed ! Can't believe what I'm paying for ! And it doesn't even work . Keeps dropping out ! Speed is on 3 ! So why do I have to be penalised to pay full amounts! Let's see if the customers service team contact me within 24 hours , bet they don't ! Would be great if they did and would be an added bonus if I could talk to someone British !"
Becca,Kent,8/22/16,I would not recommend someone I hated to BT worst company I have ever come across I had there over seas billing department mock the way I talk when he thought he had me muted I demanded to speak to a manager who apologised on his behalf If it was me mockin him I would of been called racist and been in trouble. I was meant to have full service on 27th June after hours of phone calls a new router a engineer out i received full speed n channels from 1st August n they want to charge me £194 for 6 weeks bill when I only had service for 15 days disgusting service AVOID
Luke Rodgers,"Watford, Leggatts Green",8/21/16,"BT... what could possibly be the biggest con ever.
I have had it for 4 years now with their ""Ultra fast broadband"", but really it never went over 3Mbs of download speed, or 1Mbs of upload speed. No matter how many times I called BT for help, no matter how many times they assured me that ""it'll work perfectly fine 24 hours from now"" after doing what apparently seems like nothing on their side, my broadband is terrible.

It seems they are incapable of offering any decent service or internet at all...

Go to Virgin media."
James Withers,London,8/21/16,"Charged me over £80 to cancel my line (my initial contact had finished a few months earlier). Over £50 a month for basic broadband, which wasn't that reliable. Ripoff."
URQUILLA,,8/20/16,"DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO ONE OF BT'S DEALS! I signed up for £5 broadband and £17.99 line rental for 12 months starting in September 2015. In July 2016, they increased the price to £6.10 broadband and £18.99 line rental. When I complained, they told me that they can increase their prices at any time. I seriously doubt the legality of this trick; if you advertise a product at a set price for a set duration, surely the company is legally bound to honour the advertisement or allow you to leave the contract without ""contract termination charges""?"
Paul,Pontefract,8/20/16,"Rubbish company AVOID we have been trying to get a phone line and broadband at our home for 5 Months now excuse after excuse but still no phone or broadband
They contact you to someone in India or Pakistan who place you on hold for 45 mins plus
They told me to be in today as an engineer was calling then an email mail stating the engineer didn't need a essential to our home and they had fixed the fault
This was around 2pm today it's now 18.43 and guess what not phone nor Internet
Please please Avoid bt"
Jon Murray,Whitley Bay,8/20/16,"Over the last 10 years we've been with Telewest / Blueyonder, O2 / Sky and more recently with BT and BT have proved to be far the worst in terms of quality of broadband (ADSL) and customer service.

The broadband is unreliable and struggles to cope with SD streaming and any other activity, frequently dropping out and requiring a reset. I've followed this up with technical support with little improvement. The Wifi dongle sometimes just cuts out, needing to be unpluigged and reconnected to pick up a signal.

To cap it all, our landline stopped receiving incoming calls 2 months ago and counbtless calls - during which I have to repeat the issue every time - it is still not fixed. Unsurprisingly we are cancelling our contract and moving to Virgin. It cannot possibly be worse."
Seb,Egham,8/19/16,"Like the majority of reviews I have just read, BT customer care is more than dreadful. Being in an area that doesn't have fibre, I was told by a lovey chap in the sales department that I would be guaranteed a minimum of 6mbps download speed at all times. As my existin provider (talktalk) were only able to provide me a guarantee of 1mbps, I made the switch. Having never achieved more than 4mbps and spent hours and hours (over 10 hours in the 1st week)on the phone trying to get things sorted, I was transferred needlessly from complaints to faults to cancellation. Every time I said I wanted to cancel as I am within the cooling off period. They deliberately tried to ""fix"" the issue. On day 15, they used the ""you're in contract now for 12 months line"". After finally getting through to someone based in uk, I raised a complaint to management and asked them to listen to the recorded call at point of sale. Having been accused of lying, and being told I am rude, I received a call back saying we are sorry about the issues you have had. Sure enough you were right sir. We will cancel your contract with no charge.

All that aggravation for nothing. BT have the most pathetic customer service of any company I have dealt with. No wonder sky get away with their ""believe in better"" slogan."

gregory,London,8/18/16,"Appalling service. We are in Central London and we have not had internet for 3 months. BT sent 4 engineers, 2 new hubs, I called them 30 times and they were not able to fix the problem. Also issues in the building with the landlines! Quality of service of the call centre is very poor, they don't care about customer service. We are struggling to get compensation for not having internet for a few months. Extremely disappointed and annoyed."
Don,Aberdeen,8/18/16,"Arrogant abysmal service.
Too focused on BT Sport.
How on earth do they still have operational control of Openreach when they only meet certain targets and deliberately ignore the little people.
I had BT TV with them for years before this obsession with BT Sport happened. Since fibre became available in my city area 5+ years ago I have been trying to get BT to connect the flat complex I live in as it currently has a very poor broadband connection. Typically less than 4 Mbps download and 0.44 Mbps upload. When BT 'upgraded' their TV service it became unuseable as the new service requires a fast broadband connection. I now have a Sky TV subscription as a result of this. I am now going to completely bin BT. Phone line, phone, broadband, TV, Sports, the works and move over to Sky for broadband and phone as well as TV. It will work out about the same total price (including my current Sky TV subscription) as I am currently paying these shysters £34 per month alone, on an abysmal unlimited broadband service. At least by using Sky they will be able to put pressure on these incompetents to maximise the performance of my current line. I will then try to get Sky to apply pressure to get fibre installed. My area is served by the Denburn exchange in Aberdeen and there is no excuse for not providing everyone within this area with fibre broadband."
john,england london,8/17/16,Customer service is appalling. Phones only answered promptly when you want to sign up. I cancelled BT sport and I am now outside the notice period but have just been billed for it for the next month. The only answer is for people to start taking BT to the SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Believe me it works. BT are so inefficient they would not attend the hearing....you would get judgment.
Beth,London,8/17/16,"BT = British Trash. After reading through other people's reviews, I'm really surprised their rating is overall 3 stars, it should be much lower, and you should give a 0 option just for BT. I've used them a couple of times now and each time their service, broadband and reliability is subpar in comparison to other providers. However, this occasion takes the biscuit. The most unreliable service I've ever used, extremely slow and cutting out several times a day for several hours at a time. So this means they are only providing working broadband service to their consumers for a few hours each day, yet charging full prices. They should be heavily regulated to ensure they are providing their customers with service they advertise, or be fined."
Michael,Nuneaton,8/17/16,"We moved to a remote part of Warwickshire 4 weeks ago. So wasn't expecting great speeds. Bt took 2 weeks to connect us. It ran for 4 days then went down on the 9th august.
I was promised by bt it would be repaired on the 11th, 15th and 16th August. ....I'm still waiting...no update from bt of progress...another call and put on hold for another 35 mins I guess....I DON'T RECOMMEND BT!!!"
DisgustedInBT,England,8/15/16,"BT are COMPLETELY, and UTTERLY disgusting.
I am SO dissapointed in their 'service' it feels as if im in some sort of debt with a mafia loanshark thats given me a piece of garbage worth £2 and asked for me to repay them with £90,000 before the end of the month and its the 28th.

BT broadband speed is laughable, videos buffer,(THIS ISN'T 1998) constant lagspikes, latency in games are in the 200's (to neighbouring countries) and their 'customer service'.
Ha. WHAT customer service? They don't even answer their phones!!

Router CONSTANTLY cuts out and everything to do with them is just absolutely aggrovating.

Don't forget the cancellation fees those loanshark THEIVES try to threaten you with.

Bunch of jokers.
DON'T get BT.
Stabbing yourself in the foot would be an understatement."
Chris,London,8/15/16,"My partner has been a BT customer for years so when we moved in our new flat this month, we decided to use the BT broadband services. However, the line came on and off all the time in the first three days so we called to cancel the order. Their customer service team sounded very nice and asked us to give another chance for them to investigate, so we did. We arranged a follow up call on the following day and specified due to our working hours we could only receive calls in early mornings. So their team did call back a few times but when we were at work so we missed all the calls, and there was no number for us to call back. Therefore we tried to call back again to cancel the order, then we were told the 14 days free cancellation had been passed (counting from the day we placed order). Then we spent altogether 5 hours calling their teams and got the answer that we either paid a £350 cancellation fee, or waited at home for an engineer to come over to check whether it can be fixed (but again during our working hours!). I am very surprised by their tactics and attitude to deal with their customers in this way."
Richard Lewey,London,8/14/16,"BT is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. I have taken out a contract for fibre optic broadband, TV and phone. As planned BT disconnected my old provider 2 weeks ago, but have not reconnected us. The phone works partially....but no internet and no TV. They won't tell us a connection date....the phone centre staff in India are beyond useless. They refuse to cancel the contract until the Internet is connected (I don't know why), but can't tell us when it will happen, but will charge us if we do then cancel!!!! So we are stuck with no internet, no TV and can only buy ourselves out of the contract when (if) they finally do manage to connect us. The also refuse to set up a temporary non-fibre internet connection to keep us going. The attitude is "" we have disconnected you and there's nothing you can do about it, we are not going to help out in any way all or bother to find out what is going wrong, we are not even going to bother contacting you to let you know there is a problem, you will have to spend an hour of your own time on hold waiting to speak to us, and we will then tell you that we won't be doing anything to fix the problem for at least two weeks, now please stop bothering us"""
cyanna,manchester,8/13/16,"broadband is expensive at £40/month for infinity max, but work well and is reliable.
I am however very upset to have discovered a little clause hidden in section 13 of the Terms and Conditions: even if you are not on a fixed term contract, if you move and don't want to take BT with you you will be charged, in my case £31. So beware when comparing prices..."
wayne,worksop,8/13/16,"customer service is just so bad it is unreal. Broardband reliability is good its always on just crap speeds are not as they say the poor customer service team keep telling me you have good speeds. All is working fine i don't think so 5 mbps on wifi and 22mbps on cable with bt infinity 1.
cant wait to leave very poor"
Andres,London,8/13/16,"I just can say, that before BT we used to have talk talk. BT broadband is terrible in comparison. I can't see a video."
Ivan Skavar,Hertfordshire,8/13/16,"BT – Bloody Terrible
We have been with Sky for 5 years now and have had no cause to contact them during this time. If an outage occurs they text me to inform me that they are aware of a problem in the area. Total downtime over 5 years no more than 10 minutes.
We left BT (for good) in 2011 as a direct consequence of their extremely poor customer service. It doesn’t look as though they learnt a damned thing in all this time.

Skavar"
Cat,Mayobridge,8/12/16,"I have been a loyal customer of Bt since 1996.I have up to now not complained but I feel I must tell others how I rate BT.Our internet has always been slow but within the past year it has been dreadful.I can't watch any utube,Facebook videos as it keeps pausing.I tried ringing Bt forty minutes later I eventually got through.I went with their protocol and was promised that speed with get better.I am still waiting as nothing has improved.I have tried ringing them again but again,can't get in touch with BT unless I have another forty minutes to wait listening to,We are experiencing a high number of calls please wait?I now understand the reason that everytime I call to complain that the line is busy,as I am paying full price for a service that isn't fit for purpose.I am on the lookout for a new provider,but very disappointed in BT overall."
NeveragainBT!,Sutton coldfield,8/12/16,"So, I am one of those people who read the reviews about BT before signing up, I thought, it can't be that bad surely! The sales team I called were great and I got a good deal online with some cash back. I had fibre unlimited 2 broadband and TV with an extra box.
I have just paid £135 to cancel my contact as BT are genuinely the worst company I have had to deal with in years.
The broadband wouldn't let me watch videos on YouTube from my phone (stood right next to the box!) without pausing. In the end I upped the allowance on my 4G phone contract so I could. The TV service is ok, it worked at least.
Now, on to the customer service, when you get through after 40 minutes you are greeted by someone who completely misinterprets what you are asking and tells you point blank that you 'are wrong sir' after explaining for 30 seconds after the assistant constantly interrupted it turns out I was right! No apology from the person I spoke to and no follow up from a complaint I made about over charging.

There is a reason BT has such poor reviews, it's because it is genuinely terrible and those giving bad reviews are sharing their personal experience. Which on the whole is abysmal.

I will never go with BT again and strongly urge you not to."
George reid,Worcester,8/11/16,"BT are to big, they don't appear to be interest in home support ."
Paul,Manchester,8/11/16,"I have to say I didnt think BT customer service could get worse. It is appalling.

I have spent 3 hours today on hold;
30 minutes talking to someone who clearly didn't understand the technology and couldn't speak English sufficiently well.

This is the worst customer experience I can recall. Bar none."
craig,lancashire,8/11/16,"Absolutely shocking service all round, have been without broadband now for 2 days, they are advising me it could be another 3 days before I receive a call back to get it resolved. It is a complete lottery if you get anyone that knows what they are talking about when it comes to broadband faults. If you are a new customer looking for a broadband provider I would advise that you avoid BT at all costs."
Steve,,8/10/16,Used to have speed of 1.4 mb year ago. Now lucky to get 0.7. Often 0.5 or below. Over a year and no sign of BT resolving speed or upgrading to fibre. will have pay out for satalite
Waste of time and money,Leeds,8/10/16,
Lynne mac finals,Glasgow,8/9/16,"Do not go with this company!!!

Customer service is the worst I've ever seen or dealt with! Every time you speak to someone it's either the wrong information giving or doesn't get logged. Each advisor tells you different things each time you phone and has you believing everything is sorted for you to later find out it isn't. Then they make out your the lier because they haven't taken any record of your call. Even the managers are no help, they don't even call you back when they said they would. The worst company!!!!!! Never will I be using them again!!"
Sarah,Malpa,8/9/16,Much money taken. Impossible to talk to them. Never their problem. Very poor speed - presently 0.09Mb!
Helen,retford,8/8/16,Rubbish i thought bt said they would have english call centre so they would understand you. Speak 15minutes repeating myself because they dont understand and all i wanted was past paper bill that i pay for and should have been sent for last 6 months and havent. They couldnt explain why my bill per month is £30more she just kept repeating if ur bill has gone up. Yes but why it should not have gone up my bill is unlimited broadband so round and round we go i got no where. Go on line no do ur job and find out why no. Just pay bt and do all the qork yourself when there is a problem. What are we paying for??? I still got no where with foreign and completely useless staff. Sorry but it isnt good enough when someone doesnt UNDERSTAND the english
Evin,London,8/5/16,"Absolutely awful, the broad band it self is disconecting contunuesly every couple of hours, so i thouhg it might be the hubs foult since it's not the newest one, so i ordered the latest (5 smart hub) so i have been told that this should eliminate the problem that im having. So the new hub came in after 2 weeks of calling and ordering it, since my order keeps missing. Everything worked fine for 1 (one)!!!day... then it just startet to show green light (witch means hub is starting). AGAIN, called for technical support and after 3h of talking they sent me a replacement. WHICH AGAIN was missing so after another 2weeks about 10 calls and aprox 10h on holds 3 placed orders and talking to numerous people i'm still waiting for a replacement.Thanks BT! So if you're considering to get a contract at BT, take further consideration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
NPR,Essex,8/5/16,"Why did we do it? This has ben the worst 12 months ever as far as phone and broadband go. Switched because it looked a good deal but they never met their contract promises. Average speed was .98. Tried to get out but they wanted to charge a stupid amount despite their failure to honour supply.
Service appalling an appointments never honoured. service due to be switched midnight 5th so they turned us off 18 hrs early!!! then wanted an extra charge to reconnect!! Thanks to new provider our business only suffered 4hrs loss. WARNING DON'T USE BT words fail me but inept useless come to mind."
Sue,Cumbria,8/4/16,Customer service is abysmal. Tried 4 times to cancel broadband. Kept waiting on hold for 20+minutes. Lost the will to live so hung up. Nobody rings you back. DO NOT use BT
Haroon Raja,Batley,8/4/16,Got but hub5 and i can't get broadband speed on wireless connection with wire it shows 45Mbps and on wireless it goes down to 0.19Mbps
Joyce,Stretford,8/4/16,"Worst broadband company ever, low speed (said to be 17 and I only received 3) , disconnecting very frequently like every day, no point using it all...

well it did call u back when u make a complaint, but then I kept being told that they'll ask someone to check to and get back to me, engineer appointment not available over weekend, and I tried to book it like 2 weeks later, and they said it's too early so can't book it for me?! Seriously?!"
Thatoneguy,Cornwall,8/4/16,"They are not good at all we moved on the 6th of july and they have put us off untill the 4th of august we then get a message saying we have to wait untill the 8th of october because apperently there is no line connecting even though our neighbours both have bt and there is a bt phone line in the kitchen but it has been switched off.
We got told to wait in on the 16th of july and we never had anyone turn up because apparently there was a problem at the box but we where never nottified so was waiting in until 6PM.
so they are bad in all areas as they just dont do anything and are in no rush to help anyone with poor customer service"
Laurent Baeriswyl,Canterbury,8/4/16,"Unfortunately, the terrible practices BT uses to extract a maximum amount of money possible are industry standard at this point, that however doesn't excuse them.

I've been trying to cancel my service for about 2 months now since I moved out of the house at the end of June. The online interface doesn't recognize my new address, and doesn't let me simply cancel without giving a new address. I've since called multiple times, been stuck in queues for hours, and still haven't managed to cancel my service.

Over the 2 months I've been trying to cancel my service, I'm still being charged, and not paying leads to them blocking me from cancelling the service."
Gary,Wales,8/4/16,To cut a very long story short. AVOID BT AT ALL COST. They have cost me two weeks with no broadband and £2800 in business sales lost.Customer services are rude arrogant and pass you around like a hot piece of coal.
Becky,Warrington,8/3/16,
Dave,Cardiff,8/3/16,"Appalling service - Broadband is slow and drops out all the time, sometimes it just disappears completely for hours at a time.

On top of this BT have just put their prices up by 20% 3 months into a 12 month contract. I am unable to cancel the contract as they notified my via email. Unfortunately I missed it as it got lost in all the millions of marketing emails they send me so this is my fault technically.

Customer service is appalling, long waits on the phone, aggressive and unhelpful staff. Cancellation fee to end contract is more than the remainder of the contract will actually cost me if I stay with them.

This short term attitude will lose them customers long term as I will just wait until the cancellation fee is under £100 and switch to sky who will pay this amount back to me for switching.

Terrible all round service, would not recommend BT to my worst enemy."
Ross,Warwickshire,8/3/16,"Fast but expensive and full of contract loopholes to cost you more. AVOID.

BT Infinity is not unlimited, it has a limit of 20GB per month which is not enough for general use. Upgrading after the contract costs twice what a new customer would be offered.
The TV service is not worth the money as offers no extra channels to regular freeview."
Susan,Staines,8/2/16,"Broadband regularly goes down. I spend hours in 'live chat' or on the phone. Their call centre overseas has no ability other than to log a problem and often don't understand enough English to do so.
Their record keeping is abysmal. i'm still being chased for an account I had fifteen years ago, before I moved to TalkTalk and then back to BT three years ago.
In any other industry this company would be closed down."
Doug,Ayr,7/30/16,"E mail is connected through my BT account. No access to it today. Account suspended. Talked to 3 different people in India and hours on hold. more than 2.5 hours attempting to make sense. They can't fix it and say someone will call me on Tuesday ,,, have a great evening. Utterly utterly useless company with no idea of customer service"
Tony,Bristol,7/29/16,The WORST customer service experience ever. If you go with BT be prepared to spend hours over days to get issues resolved.
GuineaGirl,N.Ireland,7/28/16,"Worst company I've ever came across. The customer service is atrocious!! Ordered my new broadband package on 2/07/16, was told the kit would arrive on 15th and service would be activated on 18th. No kit arrived. Tried live chat numerous times, these people pass you about as no one can actually help on here. Was told to ring. Called and was told a new kit would be posted - they posted a replacement hub only, not the full starter kit so was no use To me at all. Rang again 27/07/16 - was told a new set of cables for The hub would be sent out and arrive Today or tomorrow. They are crediting me £11 as a ""goodwill gesture"" for the time I haven't received the service. So basically they have no customer service skills and paying me £11 back of my own money as I haven't been able to use the service - never again will I use them or recommend to anyone."
Sui Lau,Portishead,7/28/16,"Overall unsatisfactory the service with Bt!
Definite not recommend to my family's and friends! And can't see any future business with Bt!"
Ed,London,7/28/16,"this is hands down the worst company I have EVER dealt with. painful experience and a time wasting bunch of idiots. the staff knew nothing and managers promised things and never provided them. I have been dealing with these idiots for 8 weeks now and I would rather die then deal with them. would never recommend them to anyone even if they happened to be by some miracle the last company to potentially provide a service. I have had money stolen out of my account, promised re payment and never received the payment. all calls are recorded and they have their managers and front staff promising a service and not delivering. an absolute joke of a so called British Telecoms company and I spoke with hardly anyone from England who could understand the situation."
Emily,London,7/27/16,Absolutely dreadful company. Broadband is fast when it works but if you have a fault it will take a week to fix then you will never hear back from anyone at BT. I have been trying for 4 weeks to get in touch with them and no one is responding. Full of rage and leaving for Virgin.
VictorB,London,7/27/16,"I have been a BT customer for over 10 years (service was okay - not brilliant). It is only today that I had enough.
I will have to pay to have a new router and Freeview box (had them for 5 years now) - new customers get them free.
Its not bad enough that we don't get the same great rates as new customers (my broadband was £20.00/month more expensive than new customers, and that when you do get a better deal they increase the price 1 month into the new contract.
Having contacted them I was told they sent me an email 2 months ago announcing their increases (this email I never received - ""must have gone to junkmail""). So I lost out on my free cancellation period.
Now I have been told I have to pay £270 to cancel my contract.
I find this whole matter galling - so I will stick out my contract - but will NEVER EVER again be using BT. Looking into changing the service at work as well. Lets see how much they want to charge for that."
sharon reeves,worcester,7/26/16,"I joined bt over a year ago just for the £75 gift card.I wasnt allowed the gift card as they said i didnt qualify for one although i applied for bt on line.Through the time i was with bt,my broadband was slow,kept dropping and the prices flutuated.I never had any of these problems with my previous supplier(sky).i am now with the post office so bt and stick their broadband."
Graham Wilkin,Taunton,7/26/16,
townsend,Horncastle,7/26/16,"Thought I would try BT infinity,got the bub and set up so it worked even though the signal strength wasn't as good as with just the old hub.I find it keeps crashing with no signal. Tried diagnostics all the things recommended and still it keeps crashing,phoned for technical help and after 30 minutes was told there was a fault at there end and a man was working on it and to wait for four hours or so. I explained that this fault was not just a one day problem but has been ongoing for months only to be told to wait 4 hours and call back. If that is service its no wonder this country is in the mess its in."
david,london,7/26/16,"The worst broadband I ever used !
Extremely slow, very slow response (no surprise - line are engaged for hours as so many people are experiencing problems)
Will switch as soon as I can"
George,Dumfries and Galloway,7/26/16,"Appalling!!!

Seem to be the only option where I live. 30 minutes waiting for helpline (which is in India), then they do not know what they are talking about. Just read it from a script.

I took out a package at £23 a month, 14 months later this has increased to £47 a month and no improvement in service.

I get 7.6 Mb/s (their UP TO 17).

Total rip off.

DO NOT USE BT."
Danny,Northern Ireland,7/25/16,"Terrible service, speed is slow and God help you if you want to run two devices off your router, 3G on my iPhone 5 is quicker, enquires about reducing my package to match my speed and they gave me lame excuses as to why it wasn't possible, if you need to google something go to a book shop, it would be quicker than using bt"
Gemma,milton keynes,7/25/16,"We have had the unlimited BT broadband infinity for just over a year now.
It is extortionately over priced, we now pay £50 per month for internet that is extremely temperamental.
I am constantly seeing better deals online being offered for NEW customers, but for myself who has been paying them for over a year now cannot get any of these deals, nor do they care if you say you are unhappy with it and that you want to leave.
I was receiving no internet for a few days and found it extremely hard to get through to the right people, and even the hold ring tone gives you no indication of how long you will be waiting on the phone, at some points the phone cut off and i had to ring back again.
When trying to deal with the fault with our internet and finally getting through to their faults team, they were totally un-personal and just read from a script rather then listening to me, and to top it off when i asked if i could get some of my money back as i was paying for a service i wasn't receiving i was hung up on.
I've never been so unhappy with a company before and as soon as we move home in the next few months, will be going with another provider."
Luke,Lodge,7/24/16,"Terrible, always goes down even when nex to the hub, pages are slow to load, videos buffer and fail its a general crap service"
Alison,Ceredigion,7/24/16,"I've been with BT for as long I've had a phone/broadband, I've finally had enough and I'm switching to another company. The final straw was being charged £129 by BT for a visit by an engineer. The phone line was struck by lightning, the hub blew, and I had to replace the phone. The engineer knew that it was lightning to the line that had caused it, we discussed it at length, yet his report didn't mention a thing about it. Spoke to endless BT staff and have been told that it was our fault and we have to pay the charge. Countless times over the years the phone or internet have not been working, we've never once had a penny knocked off our bill. They once took 6 weeks to come out and look at the fault. I am tired of the call-centre staff being overseas, I'm tired of the endless options when phoning them - press 1 to speak to an idiot, press 2 to speak to a lesser idiot. I'm tired of their ineptitude, broken promises, and lack of customer service. They are too large and unwieldy, they don't care about individual customers, they have too much of a monopoly, particularly as they own Openreach. I hope that the company we are in the process of switching to will be a breath of fresh air - they already score points for staff being in the UK, being smaller and friendlier (we're moving to Zen, they have really good reviews). Between the phone, broadband, and BT Vision we spent on average £50 per month, may BT enjoy their pyrrhic victory, they made us pay the £129 charge but they have lost £600 a year in payments."
Annie O'Leary,TN31,7/24/16,"Broadband Provider Pah!
Totally unreliable Broadband Provision."
Lucy,Somerset,7/24/16,"I have had interrupted broadband and limited service broadband for almost a week now. Prices went up and I started a new contract three months ago.
I keep having to reset hub several times a day. This is hopeless."
John Bruce,Southend,7/24/16,"AN expensive mistake on my part to take on what quickly proved to be very unreliable broadband. Same old BT arrogance - 'we know best, ignore the customer, buy the new router'. I can't wait for contract to end so I can put them out of my misery."
James bangs,Glossop,7/22/16,"BT telecommunications have possibly got the worst customer service team that I've ever spoke too. Firstly had a great service for two years, even without fibre the connection was excellent. Gradually the monthly bill crept up and then it came too moving house. We informed BT that we were moving and gave the correct details , all sorted.great no worries. Wrong we received a letter of confirmation on the date it would be switched on and a email. The day came didnt realise how much I would miss wi fi, mobile data sucks. No connection,so we waited a day and nothing. So I rang BT and after 40 minutes of being on hold I got through to a lovely gentleman in a call centre , who could barely speak English and after ten minutes just to relay my postcode it was not going well. After a further 20 minutes off frustrating conversation, which lead nowhere he decided too try and tell me that someone had cancelled the order and gave me the number it was cancelled off. The number he gave was my phone number and said it would take a further two weeks to connect us . Absolute joke and a complete mockery of the word customer service. I'm sure if I was a new customer I would have got a much better service. Now with talktalk, cheaper, more channels,and didn't take two weeks, Rant over"
Simon,Greater Manchester,7/22/16,Rubbish customer service and intermittent problems with the internet speed. Avoid!
Yvonne,stoke on trent,7/22/16,"Been with them 15 Years poor service , not receiving a good signal . I can only receive a signal if l am with in 12 feet of the hub . No one seems to help , will Change from BT asap service disgraceful"
Monica,Acton,7/22/16,"I have needed to cancel my contract, and I am currently trying to do this. It's still a couple of days into my cooling off period and I am well within my rights.

I've been trying since last night to cancel. It was quite easy to set up with bt, and was told if I changed my mind it would be easy to leave so long as it was within 14days of starting. Well I'm trying now and finding it near impossible.

What is not acceptable is internet providers thinking they can inconvenience you out of not cancelling. The best way to keep customers is by good customer service and good products. Get that right, people stay longer, refer others and you make more revenue. Trying to stop people cancelling by making it sp hard is ridiculous."
Jan E Robinson,dt11 8jn,7/22/16,No other choice than BT and the speeds and relaibility are appalling...promises of a better and faster service never materialise....Trying to run a business using a broadband connection in DT11 8JN is impossible !!!!
Annie,Salford,7/21/16,"If you are considering joining BT then don't. Signed a 2 year contract in October, no internet for over 2 weeks, insisted we had internet, sent 2 Openreach engineers who both said, you're right you don't have internet. They eventually fixed it but had to give us a new 'contract' this happened 4 times. They took money on all accounts so we payed them over £370 too much, we are still arguing with them. Today they tell us they are putting their charges up !!! So, what was the point in signing a contract. Utterly scandalous company."
Charlie,Surrey,7/21/16,"Just HAD to come and add my review to the pile of negative comments that get posted here due to the service BT gives. Here we pay for 30MB/s download and are on BT's buisness fibre optic deal. I am HUGE tech geek so i know when somethings up. We constantly get sh*t on from a height from bt with extremely slow services (at one weekend download went down to 0.4MB/S!!!) and constant connection interruptions. We haven't had a week go by that we have a constant connection. The 'broadband' sign on the router is always orange or non-existent when the connection drops. The only times we have had what we pay for seems to be ridiculously early in the morning and for a week after we phone them to complain. We have sent an email covering all the bases they seem to constantly say ""this can have an effect"" like hardware bottle necks. Getting us to go ONLY on certain sites to check the speed which we are sure are exaggerating our network speeds. Bt are THE WORST ISP out there and I highly recommend looking elsewhere. Possibly someone that can withhold their end of a contract that they sign you into because it is most likely that after your contract ends you have had enough of their bullsh*t and decide to go to a worth ISP of your money. I feel the need to say this so that maybe one less person is screwed over by bt and one day (hopefully) the company ends up where it deserves to be. In the dirt. TLDR: DON'T EVER SIGN WITH BT THEY WILL F*CK YOU OVER."
Chris,Slimbridge,7/21/16,My internet though infinity is so unreliable I have to use BTWifi-with-FON if I want an internet connection.
Keith,Devon,7/21/16,"We are now on our 4th BT Router! The speed is poor (1 MB/second)but worse is the Broadband service keeps dropping out. There was a public meeting with BT in the village hall at which BT said that a fibre link to the exchange could be installed. This would however need match funding i.e. if BT's cost was £30,000 the village would need to find £15,000 of that. All for a service which they should be providing in the first place. OFCOM should regulate the cost i.e. based on line speed, 20M/s = £12/month then 1Mb/s = £0.60/month. Not one price fits all, this would focus BT on improving their service."
Antonella,Cambridge,7/21/16,
Jim Jnr,Glasgow,7/20/16,"Here we go for an epic list of failure from BT broadband. For 4 years there is ongoing work due to Infinity upgrades in my area (it like 70's Eastern bloc technology) and every time work is done near my home lose broadband and/or phone line. First time as hadn't a mobile told me they'd call to arrange a repair on broken landline - yes thatwas their solution, get repair done three months later same again and next repair this happens again and again one engineer advised buy a new hub router which I do. Next one advises me cabinet is not fit for purpose at my housing estate and best to pass on Infinity as will be years before it actually works to fullest capacity.
So around a year on same happens again Kelly Communication engineers are working across street from my house and lose broadband again in this time three engineers tell me with an engineering degree they have broken a cable joint each time. At this customer services assure me will never happen again.
On 13/7/16 drop out is not resolved so start a webchat but difficult via my phone so don't get a resolution then away at work for a few days and call 17/7/16 advise of previous issues and begin a complaint so given a date of 20/7/16 for repair causing me untold hassle to re-arrange my diary but do so. On morning pf 20/7/16 re-read SMS sent to confirm this discussion/appointment it quotes 13/7/16 the week before and I reported this on 17/7/16! So after an hour two handlers agree this will not happen however their manager tells me I'm due for repair in next hour. Hour passes by and no engineer so another call and webchat which at this time advised I livei rural Scotland I dont 6 miles from largest city Glasgow seemingly it was a logistics issue for rural living which I do not have add can see two engineers vans along road so there are engineers in area- no their not well I can see them call ends with being told can't help anymore as will not accept lies and additional five day wait.
BT customer services are from the goon platoon tell you anything get called out as liars with proof each time and they rudely hang up as you tell them politely as I don't shout or swear at them as too tired of this now. BT your worse than pathetic and now leaving to get a pigeon its more reliable than your service."
Michal Suchorab,Bridgwater,7/20/16,"1.3mbps to 1.6mps
We have bought new house over two years ago
We were promised to have fibre optics soon, but I dont know what it means soon in BT language, probably whenever.
2016 and they are still building houses with those crap copper cables...
Average speed in Vietnam is 1,8mbps!!
We all here(not just me) have this issue."
Phil,Crewe,7/20/16,Wish I hadn't bothered to go with B.T. My internet speed is 1.8mbps and download is about .7 on a good day. I have spent hours speaking to customer services and to be honest I wish I could cancel my contract. My speed at night can drop below .8 Mbps but because they check during the day when there isn't so much demand on the service...any other provider couldn't be worse than these
lin,halifax,7/20/16,"terrible service - use broadband everyday and although I live in the 'near' countryside, expecting with fibre optics to get 15GB
I end up getting less than 10 - and even 5 most days
the broadband 'sticks' and web pages stick most times
also - I DO NOT like the way they add sneaky little extras like 'display view'with TPS on the bill - I do not have a display phone, still get loads of unwanted calls (about 3+ a day)and when I try to remove the option, it is so complicated to understand the choices (they have a sneaky way of hiding options) that you give up in case you choose something worse!"
Ala Hall,Bromley,7/20/16,BT Broadband is just dire and is only matched by the service which is even more dire. They insist the broadband dropping out numerous times per day or so slow it won't even laod a simple website is working properly and a formal complain acknowledged in writing has not even been actioned months later. Just don't bother.
Rich B,Herts,7/20/16,The worst customer service - Disgraceful for such a big brand. They do not answer the phone. You end up in a queue and it then just cuts you off after 15 mins. This happened to me 4 times in a row this morning. Wifi is rubbish - signal keeps dropping from all devices.
Tom,Reading,7/20/16,"Non existient customer service, unreliable bband connection, billing errors and inability to handle simple reqest like transferring the service to new address. Constant calls from their rude sales team."
Julian,Forton somerset,7/19/16,I went with bt when I was told not too only wanted to go with them as I wanted bt sport I joined at January and still can't get it now I have given up ringing them as you never can understand what there saying just can't wait till new year so I can get rid of this useless contract and next time I might listen to what people say when they tell me not to bother with a company
Barend Botha,"Belgravia, London",7/19/16,"Poor!Poor!Poor!. My broadband was supposed to be on on the 19th June. Writing this review on the 19th of July! Still not working, I was told it should work by midnight tonight. Applied on the 6th of June. On my engineers visit of the 18th no one turned up. On the Saturday sent me a new order ref, and put my service back to 19 July. Appartently there was a Glitch on the system and they could not bring my date forward, so had to wait till today. I received a tect at 11 am this morning that my broadband should now be working, Still Not!!

Do yourself a favour and stay away!! There are more professional companies out there. BT, pls stop scamming people with your adverts to join Up. Cant even help the ones that are already signed up

All they can say on the 25 calls I made to them is Sorry...Sorry...Sorry...

Never again in my life!"
Norman Kidd,Ky154gxgordon.kidd@gmail.com,7/19/16,Think twice before subscribing to BT Broadband unless you want to be charged £60 for exceeding your broadband usage limit for which BT say I have used but I have no explanation for only use broadband for browsing nothing else standard broadband very poor anyway --- very unsatisfied customer
Antoine,London,7/18/16,"I decided to use BT for my new restaurant and it's been a nightmare since the beginning.
1. They first got my order wrong: we agreed for fibre and they installed ADSL
2. When I notified it, they said sorry we will sort it out. No one ever bother to call me back despite their promises by chat or by text.
3. After I chased them, they finally raised a new order that was cancelled 10 days after without any explanation or notification.
4. I chased again to get a new order. An engineer eventually came onsite to install the order but said he could not do it because the line was not ready for fiber.
5. 10 days later another engineer came to say exactly the same.
6. 10 days later another engineer came again for the same result (this is not a joke!)
7. Today, I am still waiting for someone to get back to me with an explanation.
In the meantime they of course did not forget to take my money. When I asked them to get access to my online account they told me they could not do it because I don't have my details (I am a new customer, I did not receive anything). I replied OK, give me my details. They told me to ask my bank in order to get my BT account number!!!! They are my supplier but can't give me my account number!!!!

3 months after having suscribed, I am left with no fibre, no invoice, nothing but with hundreds of pounds debited on my account.

Really awful service!"
Kamrul Islam,,7/18/16,I wish there was a zero star for rating because BT sucks slow internet connection sometimes it doesn't even connect. I am just waiting for the 12 months contracts. As soon as it's over I am gonna throw this Broadbrand in the bin
SHAUN,LANCASHIRE,7/18/16,"Ignore the word ""CONTRACT"" It means nothing.Prices went up within 6 months on the pretext of better service and because line rental went up.Not seen any difference in sevice yet Cant wait to get away from them BUT What do you go for? these companies all have their snouts in the same trough!!!"
Jeremy,"London, UK",7/17/16,"I have been with BT many years, however within the last 18 months (since getting the latest versions of their 'Home Hubs' the reliability has become so poor that I am moving provider. The connection drops out/resets several times a week - I use the connection for streaming and gaming, so a stable connection is crucial. When you ring support to ask why it has dropped out, they're unable to provide a solution and you're told that unless the connection is dropping more than 6 times a day, they will not consider sending out an engineer. Successive replacement Home Hubs have not resolved the issue. The speed is good but if you depend on reliability, do not go with BT.

Wifi is also poor - even when close to the router, the speed is either slow or the connection just seems to randomly drop out.

Better providers out there that provide better value for money and greater reliability."
Martyn,Essex,7/16/16,"Like previous reviews I wish I could give zero stars. In short do not touch them, go elsewhere. I have engineers out twice and told there is no problems. Hub fine, wiring fine and yet the BT Affinity spends more time down than up. Last engineer discovered that BT were actually 'suppressing' the line and I was only getting 11meg and was paying for 40meg connection. Please don't waste your time or money with them"
Craig,Troon,7/16/16,"Terrible service, we have an issue with Internet and phone connection....we have been on the phone since 9am this morning....2 hours latter and the clowns at BT are incapable of solving a simple solution. Pathetic customer service."
sothatsit,Rural Wales,7/15/16,"Aghhhhhhh! Guess we'll be the 5% of population that gets left behind in this superfast roll out. We can't even complete an online shop. As for trying to watch catch up TV, iplayer or anything else on our 'smart' TV forget it. Not been able to connect to the Internet for more than a couple of minutes for a week now! They are 'looking into it'. Not recommended"
O,Hampshire,7/14/16,"Been paying £32 a month for 'BT Infinity 2' since it was available (so they claim) in my area / road. Never been able to achieve a download rate above 2megabytes per second. Speedcheckers on various websites showed I was getting 17.7mbps, now this is well below BT Infinity 1, let alone 2.

Simply put, they sell you a product that doesn't exist. Their own technical team stated I should expect speeds of 20-30mbps. Where is the ""up to 76mb"" they advertise and sold me?"
Sean Holler,London,7/14/16,If i could give lower stars I would. This company and their customer service team are useless. I was contacted 5 times about the same issue from multiple people saying it was solved only to be told by the next the issue was not solved. They could not locate a line in my property despite them saying they had one. The company can barely walk and chew gum never mind handle services.
Dave,Bolton,7/13/16,"A word of advice to anyone thinking of using BT. Unless you really want it don't subscribe to BT Sport, even though it may be 'free'. HIf you decide to change supplier the don't automatically cancel the sports package. They send you a message stating that they'll switch you to full priced BT Sport lite at £13.50 a month, unless you ask to cancel it. This means you have no option but to contact them. When you ring you'll be put through to a customer service adviser who would make the hardest of 1980s double glazing salesmen blush. After 15 minutes of screaming at him to just cancel the sports package he then informs you that there is a 30 day cancellation clause for which you'll be charged the £13.50. What a con"
chamali,FELTHAM,7/13/16,"very very bad service ... bt are professional scammers ..customer service staff are not helpful at all ... have changed broadband service without informing me, put me to the highest tariff and had to pay 65 pounds for a month for phone and internet ."
Sam,London NW5,7/13/16,"First they told me several times there would be a half hour window between switching from sky to bt, 2 days later they are sending an engineer in 3 days 5 days total so far. The Asian call centre are 50% useless. I left BT 5 years ago for Sky. Sky's customer service is Rolls Royce and BT's is pushing a handcart uphill. I will complain to the regulator and I suggest everyone does the same."
Beach01,Gloucestershire,7/13/16,"I wish I had found and read this site before placing my order with BT. I currently have no broadband at home because my order is now one week late. Every time BT email me with a new date (in words that suggest they are doing me a big favour!) it is a later date than the unacceptably late one they have already given.

I cannot comment on the quality of their broadband as I have yet to experience it, although I am now expecting the worst.

The customer service however cannot be described as terrible or appalling. It cannot be described in that way because it simply does not exist. Totally and utterly pathetic."
Phil,Northwood,7/13/16,"If only I could award zero stars. BT Internet cuts out several times a day everyday. I have literally spent hours trying to sort it out with awful Indian call centres (they should rebrand as Indian Telecom as it would be more accurate). They have hung up on me, promised and booked callbacks which they fail to do, they also did not send introductory offer prepaid MasterCard for over six months, they promised to do this six times and then claimed I was not eligible. I only received the MasterCard when I threatened legal action with small claims court. They are a terrible repugnant company. I was a sky customer previously and had zero problems with them over 4 years and wish I had not switched. I will be changing as soon as my contract is finished. Do not use BT."
Tom,,7/12/16,"I consider myself a patient person, there have been many an occasion when I have had to be on hold on a phone call or not received the level of service required, but I always think to myself 'maybe the person on the other end of the line is having a bad day!' And so I just put it behind me and move on ... In BT Sports case, they are a pathetic and useless bunch!

Having tried to resolve a simple issue, BT Sports not working after paying for subscription, you would think after three horrendous, longwinded and incompetent phone calls, I still do not have BT Sport... And the incompetence far reaching, I am staggered to understand how there could possibly be so many layers of outrageous incompetence. That in itself, I have to admit is impressive. I mean credit to them that they can behave this way and still have a viable business.

In my last call (note not final, but last) the customer service assistant - 'customer service' being a figurative speech - they suggested the fault lies not with BT sport but rather our own TV. This was until I pointed to her this was the same TV that played TV sport a mile down the road only 4 weeks ago ahead of moving into our new house. She appeared perplexed, like a deer in headlights, at the prospect at having to veer from her scripted speech of blaming long suffering customer... I mean could it possibly be...BT sports fault???"
jack,Leicester,7/12/16,
Anthony,Worcestershire,7/12/16,"I don't usually leave reviews, but in this case I have to make an exception. BT have been appallingly awful. I ordered BT Infinity online on the 28th April, paid for a line rental saver and connection charge (£243.28) only for them to cancel the order 10 days later claiming I needed a new line (I don't). I was offered the same deal on the phone and they said they would waive the £130 charge for a new line (which they tell me at this point I need, but later tell me I don't) so reordered Infinity only for it to turn out to be considerably more expensive than they promised when the details came through, so I cancelled that in May. Since then I have had a bill for £34 taken from my account, and a final bill for £9- despite never having had telephone or internet from BT. I have made 8 phone calls to them- over 5 hours in total- and still have not had the 243.28 refunded nearly 3 months later, despite repeated promises to do so. BT you are awful, and I wouldn't even recommend your services to someone I didn't like. Beware."
sally,scotland,7/12/16,Moved house (to next door) No phone or broadband for 6 weeks now. No customer service. Delay management just manage to delay. Lies and excuses. Failure to communicate. Connection dates continually changed. Still receiving monthly bills. Need I go on.
Andrew,Gloucester,7/11/16,"BT, once a nationalised business, was privatised, sold its mobile business (surely the most stupid decision ever!) and has now made a bold leap into the world of glossy marketing and advertising, as well as a brave foray into the sports broadcasting arena. It has the underlying telecoms infrastructure, and is expanding the fibre broadband network, improving the speeds of many householders. All of the openreach engineers I have interacted with are helpful nice people, likewise the call operators.

Its customer services leave a great deal to be desired. When I say customer services, I am not referring to the individuals who are on the end of the phone (who are friendly and professional), but the underlying processes, and the design of their customer interface systems which are devious and designed to obfuscate.

BT is far too aggressive in its wish to sell sell, sell. I would happily jump ship to another supplier, if I could. Sadly I have 9 months left to go. BT's website is designed as a glossy magazine style space for selling BT's 'products' rather than a broadband and TV supplier website oriented towards the customer. It's single aim seems to be to sell more 'products' as it calls them. You cannot cancel a service, you enter into another 'product'. It's very odd, and smacks of contractual requirements from which it is hard to extricate oneself. Nothing can be cancelled online, you must call the BT call centres, usually busy, and often in India, where you will get conflicting advice from the customer advisors. For example. I was told that I would be eligible for a partial refund for my poor performing broadband - I was paying £45 a month, including £18 for a phone line which I don't use, for 17MB connection, when in fact I was getting 6MB. I thought it reasonable to ask for a partial refund, and I was told that would be acceptable, once the problem was fixed. I was later told that I would not get any refund for a service which was poorly performing, only when it was non-existent, and that it would be up to me to demonstrate that the service was poorly performing.

There is no doubt that the underlying tone of a business comes over in all that it be. I find BT to be way too aggressive, and not remotely bothered about keeping its customers happy. We pay a lot of money, and we must ask ourselves, are we getting value for that money? I don't feel that I am. As soon as I have an alternative, I will be cancelling my contract ith BT and going elsewhere, and customer service will be my first priority. A company which treats its customers as a cash cow, to be exploited for maximum financial gain, does not deserve any of my hard earned, hard taxed money. Dear BT, try becoming customers of Virgin Media and see what 'customer services' is really all about. Piss off your customers, and as soon as they have an alternative, they will disappear. You have been riding your monopoly benefit for far too long, and you don't deserve your prized position"
dARIUS,Abingdon,7/11/16,"Been with BT nearly 2 years and I have to say what a big mistake I've done choosing this broadband provider as the services are extremely expensive and not worth a penny of what people pay..
1 st thing they say that the broadband speed is up to 76 - NOT
The fastest I've seen was 7 MB/s which can be classified as fraud and telling lies to customers as its far away from 76 MB/s
Another thing is that connection is never stable and I always keep getting disconnected, tried speaking with the fault team and they've sent me a new router and nothing changed, after trying to sort that out for months just gave up ...
all in all very expensive , very unreliable and very disappointing... Wouldn't recommend to anyone"
graeme faulkner,broughton,7/11/16,Had problems with signal from day 1 they tried to blame it on all sorts of things even though my previous provider had no problems . I had to buy a WI fi extender which helped but signal drops out all the time even though all different settings had been tried just gone back to sky and the problems are now sorted not cut out once bt has a bad hub bad service avoid the hype about the hub 5 being the best there is it's false advertising !!
christine,isle of skye,7/10/16,I'm having problems week on week. Keep ringing BT they sometimes put the download speed up to a decent level then within a week it's back down to circa 0.06MB! Not fit for purpose! Last week I was told it would be up to 3MB and stay that way. What a fool I was to believe them! I'm trying to set up a business from home and need the internet but this is getting past a joke. I was on the phone for over an hour last week trying to get things put right. Bottom line is I'm being robbed: paying for a so called service that isn't there.
Steven abrahamson,Cornwall,7/9/16,
Ramin,London,7/8/16,"Very poor customer service!!!
Charged me without any explanation!!!!
I sent them many email and call them many times but unfortunately nobody was responsible!!!"
Phil,NORWICH,7/6/16,"Worse than pxxx poor performance. Unbelievable that BT's ""outreach team"" OPENREACH cannot justify up grading the service. Money has been ""stolen"" from BBFN to upgrade already fast urban speeds which should have been allocated to rural communities.."
J Sargent,Milton Keynes,7/6/16,I was promised fibre optic within a month of joining if I left sky and have never got it despite hundreds of calls. Sky was better. I asked for 78 and get 1.7 or up to 2.0 if a lucky day. It drives kids and myself mad with buffering and slowness even on mobile phone!! Bt call centres lied and I am in a contract until September paying £51 per month which includes phone line and am paying for useless Internet and useless service. Even the engineers come out and say it is useless but there is no space in the fubre box st the end of my road. Is there anyone who can guarantee me 100% around 78.00 fibre ???
Dardan,New Barnet,7/6/16,Very bad experience. They changed the price and I received an email saying that I don't need to pay antything if I would like to close the contract as the price changed. After a month I saw THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO STILL £251 from my bank account!!! I called and still now they did not risolve the problem and are trying to get some money. I really don't understand this brand and only now I realised why it's so difficult also to write an review like everybody does through google or social media. Ridiculous
Josie,Sheffield,7/5/16,"Now I don't usually do this, leave reviews I mean but I desperately want to discuss my issues with bt even if it only helps one person refrain from signing up to the worst service provider ever; no I am not being theatrical. So it all started when I ordered my infinity 1 and entertainment plus tv package, now anyone who has read up on bt knows how expensive the services are, but hey you must pay good money for good services, but hey, I did my bit now I'm just waiting on bt to do theirs. At first they gave me the wrong hub so I got standard broadband instead of my infinity which in turn led to me not receiving my premiuim channels, sucks right? Well when I called up I was hung up on twice and then finally spoke to someone who seemed genuinely interested in sorting out my problem, or maybe it's just because we all know ""calls are recorded for quality purposes"" HAH what a joke that is I am actually in fits of giggles.. no, I lied, I most definitely am not. So anyway even though I didn't receive the correct services for the first month I paid my bill having faith that good old abdul or as you and I know him as 'Adam from bt' well you let me down didn't you Adam or abdul or whatever. And now my second payment has been taken and can you believe the cheek??! They've taken almost triple what my bill should be out of my bank.. I am still greaving over my hard earned cash. I mean I don't even have a landline so I can't be going over on my call package, I have unlimited broadband so it can't be that WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GET BT SERVICES"
Colin,Angus,7/4/16,"This review is of a new connection and we are new customers to BT. BT's broadband checker suggests 2.34Mbs where as 3 other independent speed checking sites suggest 1.82Mbs, 1.94Mbs and 2.04 Mbs. BT have failed 4 times to connect our Broadband, each time giving a definite date, assuring us that the connection has been fast tracked. On the 5th attempt after the engineers rejected the request for fast track, it was connected but a day later than promised. Customer support was appalling - both call centres based in UK and India were as bad as each other, BT's policy will not let you speak to a manager - who you get taking your call is the person that you will deal with, yet after each person assured us that they would personally check and email and call me to update - NONE of them have. A complaint was raised and the person dealing with the complaint said they would call me back at a specific time, it is now 4 days later and no call. Apologies if this is a rant but if this is what a company is like to NEW customers, i dread to think what it will be like once we are no longer regarded as NEW !!"
keith,Warminster,7/4/16,"Worst provider I have ever had, I would advise anyone thinking of joining BT to look elsewhere. Customer service is non existent, and you can rarely speak to anyone who understands or speaks English.
The broadband speed is lucky to reach 1mb, stay well clear of BT"
JM,London,7/4/16,Awful product. Always failing. Do not switch to BT. Go with Sky
Phil,Northwood,7/4/16,"Do yourself a favour and do not get bt broadband. Our internet just cuts out multiple times a day; this dispite several engineer visuts and literally days trying to get throught to and speaking with indian customer services. The company should change its name to indian telecoms. bit also took them over 6 months to honour our introductary offer as we signed up online.
As soon as our contract is finished I'm going back to Sky."
rashah,London Finchley,7/3/16,"over all satisfaction veer poor
customer service extremely POOR
Broadband speed Poor never experienced 1 MB for the serviette they sold me as 10Mb
Broadband readability very poor often without. They were charging me £15 a month for a service I had not most of the time and I have send them hundreds of email."
Geraldine,London,7/3/16,
Barnaby,PAIGNTON,7/2/16,"Terrible custormer service was on hold for 30mins to be diverted and on hold another 10mins, take money they arnt supposed to then try to justify it to you! Con artists and not good people dont give them your money"
Marlon,London,7/1/16,"I opted to join the new BT revolution from sky TV following the EPL games being shown. I would have signed up for the whole package and found a great deal online including cash back. The first (broadband) order was cancelled as apparently sky tv put a cease on the line. I cleared this with Sky and put in a second order (which was also cancelled) so after faffing around with their automated system I eventually got through to someone who did a line check and confirmed the cease had been lifted but not before I put in the second order. So I losing patience put through a third order, this was also cancelled. This time I lost my patience and asked to speak with a manager, I was told one wasn't available despite one having already cancelled the the third order. I was told one would call me back on Friday coincidently AFTER the deal had finished. I did receive call but on the house phone (they did have my mobile number but obviously decided it wasn't worth calling on that). I called back as soon as I arrived home from work. I waited on hold for 24 minutes then was told (by you guessed right, an automated service) that it was now 8pm and they were now closed (no sh** Sherlock!).
Their service (if you can call it that is utterly shocking and I would NEVER use these clowns)."
John,Peterborough,7/1/16,"The service is terrible . The automated system with varying voice tones to keep you in order is terrible . The engineers analysis is sometimes very poor . Over 6 hours of my time on the phone trying to get them to sort it and in the end sorted it myself using an old hub . Now I wait for a replacement hub . They don't pay recompense for list time , time off work , lost use of equipment or anything ."
Mrs D,Essex,6/29/16,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. We pay for ""super fast fibre optic"".... What a joke! The connection regularly drops out, the speed is often less than 1MB, and BT do naff all about it!!
We have had 2 cancelled engineer visits because BT are unable to organise a p*ss up in a brewery! To top it all off, if we want to cancel it is £150 for the pleasure. AVOID BT!!"
sami,Hove,6/29/16,I moved to a house that had been already using BT for a couple of months. The service got broken 2 weeks ago. We have contacted BT several time and every time they gave us different reason and different expected date to fix the issue. It has been two weeks now with no explanation from them. It is irritating and i would never every recommend BT for someone else.
Stephen todd,"highlands, scotland",6/29/16,"If you want to have the worst experience possible then you have come to the right place.
BT are horrendous for customer service, they don't care about the customer alls they want is your money, whether or not they are providing the service that you are both in contract for.
I had nothing but problems for the month and a half that I was with them.
Even when I cancelled they tried to bill me £500+ for cancelling as they said I was breaching the contract by terminating early. Even after I quoted their terms and conditions to them (and emailed the advisor the terms and conditions and the link to their website) they still tried to charge me.
They don't have a clue what they are doing and don't care about the customer.
Worst company ever... Sky all the way"
David Langhorne,Solihull,6/28/16,For several months my Homehub 2 was cutting out. I reported it twice and was fobbed off by customer services who said it was - connected to wrong socket/interference by microwave/cordless phone etc etc. They would not believe the homehub could be faulty.In the end I bought a Homehub 3 from ebay and have had no problems since. They appear to have logged only one complaint even though I complained twice earlier this year and refuse to compensate me for several months bad service.
Ana,Enfield,6/28/16,"BT customers service is the worst I've ever received (and I've had some bad service). I wanted to change the contract we had into my name - everything else to remain the same and they wouldn't allow me to do so witho paying £50 connection fee even though they weren't connecting anything- nothing at all was changing. When I refused to do that and asked to cancel the contract they charged me £30+ to cancel- even though I was out of contract. Just plain scam artists, would never use again."
Harry,London,6/27/16,"8 months, 21 case managers, 10 engineers, and 4 missed work days later - you can probably see that I have had enough.

BT's level of customer service (especially after outsourcing their departments to Banglore) is shocking and unacceptable for these reasons:

1) the did not deliver the services I paid for
2) are using delay tactics to out stretch any chance of rebate
3) they lie and use deception to give an impression they are dealing with my complaint, as every person I spoke to was swapping roles, reciting the same script, redirecting me to one of their colleagues
4) wasted my time by not reviewing my case before calling
5) not informing me when engineers would be coming, not accommodating for vulnerable people
6) were rude and intimidating
7) try and get people other than the account holder to close faults.


My family and I have been severely distressed during this ordeal. We did not have a working phone line for a period or time so my elderly mother could not call the emergency services if she needed an ambulance, nor did I have any piece of mind in case my children were to fall ill, and my professional life has suffered as I could not access work resources to work from home.

I have financially lost out a lot more than I ever expected. I have had to spend additional money on travelling to work when there was no need to do so, incurred additional mobile phone costs, and more importantly have had my time wasted which is something I will never get back.

I am still having my time wasted wrapping up this issue and do not want to simply change providers for my phone line and internet because if BT own the communication infrastructure, getting it resolved by someone else will be an even longer process.

I am a realistic person and accept there are factors which may affect my services, but what cannot be justified is the unacceptable level of customer service, the unrealistic fix times especially when vulnerable people are involved, and the lack of consideration for the customer."
D Harvey,GL74BW,6/26/16,"I was Ok with BT , not the best line speed with drop outs etc but the main problem was when i came to move home. I arranged the move and they told me all would be fine and i would be connected within a week. It didn't happen and they ended up cancelling my contract and told me that as I had cancelled early there would be an early termination charge. I have not been able to resolve this and when i asked them to connect me as a matter of urgency they said it would take another 3 weeks.
They don't listen or care and when things do go wrong they make no attempt to correct it"
Megan,London,6/25/16,"Terrible! Wow, avoid completely.

I am astounded at the level of customer service the company offers. Truly sad. My poor 70+ year old mother moved and when setting up her phone in her new flat the line would not call in (calls out were fine at first). She called to let them know. A very unhelpful person told her to disconnect the phone and plug it into the box. This did not work, and after plugging the phone back in outgoing calls stopped working as well. That is when she was told it was the developers problem and not BTs. Obviously, it is BT problem as the prior tenant, the landlord (who lives in the building), and other neighbors do not have this problem. After sitting on hold, speaking with multiple so-called customer service reps, having my called dropped, having loud noises played in my ear I have decided to file with the OFcom for dispute resolution to have the non-working line that my poor retired mother is paying for.

Truly sad, and very disappointed that any service provider with the name British in it would treat a senior this way. How, er, un-british at best, more like a scam."
Kevin,Southbourne Dorset,6/25/16,"They promised me broadband speed of 6-8mbps when I signed up, and I've never had more than 2mbps. 6 weeks later, still no closer to them even admitting there's a problem."
Mark,leamington spa,6/24/16,"If you want to lose the will to live, choose bt infinity.
I have had it installed for 15 months.
It has never worked properly.
I have spent over 45 hours on the phone, had engineers visit 4 times, had 3 sets of bt powerline adapters, had 3 different tv boxes and have never had a reliable working broadband and wi-fi.
The last engineer ( 3 weeks ago) said that it would not ever work in our house.
bt will not let us out of the contract even though they are not providing the service as advertised."
Davenport,London,6/24/16,
BT is nonsense and a joke,Lincolnshire,6/22/16,What a joke BT is. Broadband line regular drops the connection. Down speed in between 1 and 2 Mbps and upload today is .24! service from the helpline is a nonsense. They have no understanding about broadband not about BT equipment - they just tick boxes and read from the script. AVOID BT.
cliff cowie,dunblane,6/21/16,"I wish I could score zero.the worst company I have ever dealt with.a few weeks ago I decided to switch from another provider,i placed my order and paid my money,bt cancelled it,ordered again,same result,placed a third time,once again cancelled.i went back to my original provider.meanwhile despite not havinga bt order I have now had three hubs delivered to me and even had a text to confirm a date for engineer to install tv.really could not make it up.they are also sending bills but worst of all I cannot get my money back from them,it,s a lot of money so I won,t stop until I get it back.i am now getting my bank involved,then Ofcom,watchdog and paper.please do not use this incompetent useless company.BT should be ashamed of themselves but they don,t seem yo care"
Robert,Lewes,6/21/16,"I have just moved house and was going to transfer my BT Broadband to the new address however when looking into things i saw that my original deal had ended and that I was now paying £47 and i don't even use the phone as I have a digital number, BAD DEAL In my opinion they should have sent me a letter regarding the new increased charge. I phoned up Sky and they can offer exactly the same deal for £17, so much better and you are effectively getting exactly the same thing. So I called up BT to cancel my package and they said that I needed to give them 30 days notice and pay a cancelation fee of £31. All in all this a lot of money wasted and I will not be returning to BT because of this.Yes this stuff is probably all in the small print but in my mind this is just a way of fleecing consumers because people don't tend to read this stuff, and they know it. Not impressed BT, short term thinking."
Techman,Yorkshire,6/20/16,"What customer service? Six days to fix a line fault in this day and age? Typical of a large company...they just can't deliver good old fashioned customer service. What's more, they don't appear to care."
Alan,Shropshire,6/20/16,"overall poor. Since I decided to quit BT ive had 4 fraudulent telephone calls maintaining they're BT until I ask for their number then they hang up. This has been reported. They maintain there is a fault with the system

Beware"
Tommie,Were,6/19/16,"Drops out constantly - customer services ""re-set the line"" works for a day - then drops again - repeat process"
Adam birtchnell,Patrington,6/18/16,Took 18 months and dozens of phone calls to get them to even connect us to broadband. Utterly useless in everyway. AVOID FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH.
Natasha,Manchester,6/18/16,"AVOID joining BT at all costs!!!

My partner signed up to get BT sports, he cancelled it in September as we were moving house. We've ended up with a debt collecting agency on our backs with a huge bill!! Partner spoke to them at BT who said they had not received a notice of cancellation.. when he asked where the bill had come from and what is was for they said it's because we didn't pay our cancellation fee.. so why would we pay a cancellation fee if theyre saying they haven't cancelled it!?!?!? Totally contradictory!!!
When we asked why did nobody contact us via telephone to sort out this matter sooner we were told ""That is not how we operate""
Very unhelpful customer services, they talk out of their arses!!
Such a big company and yet dissatisfying customers all the time it seems.. absolutely disgraceful - it's be because of greedy firms like BT why people like us who work hard for a living end up in debt!!! Which could have easily been rectified with a phone call.. Going to take this further we are absolutely livid!!!"
James,Huddersfield,6/18/16,"I tried to place an order for internet and there was hidden fees when I got to the end of the order process. I called to helpline to query the added fees and was met by an unhelpful individual who told me the fees where to install a BT line despite a BT line being in the property already. He also gave me a false name on the phone followed by abuse. However, BT are conveniently unable to trace the call. I would avoid at all costs!"
Nathan,Northern Ireland,6/15/16,"Slow as a tortoise and disconnects every 15 minutes, quality."
steveA,southend on sea,6/15/16,"Infinity 1 installed on Friday. Over the weekend had problems with access and internet stability. Phoned help desk and was told it takes 48 hours to settle but they would monitor my line. Phoned again on Tuesday because the problems persisted. Connection speed 5Mbps. Told that my order was still open which could cause slow internet and that someone would phone me. Phoned again Wednesday as no improvement and no phone call as promised. The help desk put in a fault and said they would monitor the line. I told them they had promised that on my first call but their records did not reflect that. Also no record of the promise to phone me. I now have to wait for a call within the next 48 hours to let me know what they are doing to fix the problem. I am willing to place a bet that they will not phone me. I told them I will not be paying for the internet until it performs as advertised.
The advertised offer also CLEARLY stated BT SPORTS with BT infinity 1. After installation I was told it was only BT SPORTS LITE and if I wanted BT SPORTS I would have to pay an extra £5 per month.
I deeply regret changing my internet provider and will cancel my BT contract if they fail to improve service."
Rachael,Hereford,6/15/16,"BT have had me in tears, the engineer did not ring when they said they would, took time off work, so stayed in all day and they did not come, then they offer me a date 3 wks away, shocking treatment from BT, if you want stress go to BT and the staff in support don't speak good English. Nightmare"
T Meade,London,6/15/16,I have never experienced such poor customer service on all fronts. I have just raised a security issue and been told that to fix it I will have to use a chargeable service. I spent countless hours online and on the phone trying to fix the infinity connection problems and it was like getting blood out of a stone. I am counting down to the end of the contract with bt.
Brian,newtownards,6/15/16,Not getting speed I was told I would get when I started contract.customer service rubbish.
neil,manchester,6/14/16,
Peter,Oxford,6/14/16,"I attempted to upgrade to fibre as the copper speeds I was getting we're slow and I could not stream reliably. Also internet based heating system kept failing in view of poor broadband reliability. Upgrading to fibre was disastrous. There was a glitch with the address (incorrect house number listed on open reach network) so the engineers kept going to wrong address. BT would not fix and ultimately B was left with no broadband.
Any interaction with them takes 1 to 2 hours via a call centre off shore. Problems need to be explained time and time again. After about 8hours on hold over a 6 period and failure of their complaints department to fix things I gave up and left."
ms gul,london,6/11/16,"Son signed up to BT whilst I was away and they authorised payment! Came back from holiday and realised we have a new internet. Mis-sold product to low allowance mb so upgraded to infinity package. This made our contract expand meaning our cancellation date was set to a longer date. Poor customer service line, speaks general and defensive over their T&C's and do not value a customer realising they are leaving them and moving to their competitors. BT TV hardly works and always have to restart the modem and then they blame it on our area. I live in the heart of London, how is that possible? I do not live between mountains. Overall, will not recommend to ANYONE."
Alan,Llanharan,6/8/16,"Customer service is having to wait 30 minutes for an answer, then another 30 minutes for the ""technician"" to mess about. They then tell you that it is all OK now but will have to wait 24 hours for it to reach full speed. 2 hours later broadband is running goin so slowly that my e-mail server is timing out when retrieving mail. I suppose that I'll have to go through it all again tomorrow!"
Mrs Bowden,Four Marks,6/8/16,the worst provider we have ever been with. Customer services are unhelpful and patronising. Think very hard before joining. Was with Talktalk for 14 year and wish we never left
Mrs McGill,"Minting, Lincolnshire",6/4/16,"Do not use BT. We are consistently receiving a broadband speed of 0.2 to 0.7 megabytes, nowhere near the PROMISED 1MB.
We can only use one device at a time and, even then, we get messages stating that our broadband speed is insufficient.
Terrible customer service who say that the exchange is 1.2 MB, so they have fulfilled their part of the contract.
AVOID!"
Brian Morris,Hereford,6/2/16,"I must be one of the lucky ones after reading such bad reviews. I've been with BT for a number of years and only had one problem when our phone line went dodgy. But overall, the speed isn't as fast as it could be, but it's okay. Customer service is pretty good. They have made the effort to call me back when I've been on the wrong shift. Broadband reliability is good too. No breakdowns. In fact when I switched to BT from Virgin and Virgin turned me off three weeks early, BT gave me 4000 minutes of free internet to tide me over until they connected me. Now that has to be good service."
Richard williams,LLANELLI,5/31/16,Absolutely shambolic! No Internet for over a month and told if I cancel my direct debit then they will take me to court! No fluent British speaking customer services either is a joke!
Stella,Southampton,5/31/16,
Joel Macis,Midlands,5/31/16,Good broadband speed but BT has little customer support and frequent broadband downtime.
Lynn,South Oxfordshire,5/30/16,"Well, 15 weeks into contract and issues still not resolved and eventually they have the cheek to say they will now let us cancel our contract. First two weeks no service at all and they said we must have set it up wrong so had to take half day off work to wait for engineer to call. The engineer confirmed it was their fault as they had set it up wrong at the exchange. This was supposedly corrected. Still no broad band tv channels after fix was applied. Was then told it was a line speed issue and ours wasn't fast enough to receive the required channels. Two days later was told it was a line capacity issue and the fix would be applied in a weeks time. The week passed and no fix was applied. Will skip the rest but 15 weeks later received a call to say the actual issue was one of their engineers had connected the wrong cables at the exchange and the fix was now in place. Great- I'll watch the channels I want - Sadly not. After re-setting all the kit for some reason all our services had now disappeared so the fix actually made the appalling service even worse. In total 1.5 days off work for engineers, 15 hours on the phone to overseas call centres and still not the service we are paying for. They have the cheek to offer £30 compensation which I promptly told them where to put it. I want a full refund as I've never received the service I paid for. Steer well clear of BT. APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE and incompetent in every area."
unhappy bt customer,near london,5/29/16,"Very unhappy have complained now three times, wish i could take legal action as they are taking fees under false pretences. am not receiving service paid for and then cannot get any sort of customer service.
Change speed to router for few weeks then reverts to rubbish, paying for 76mbs only receiving 29mbs."
Malcolm smith,Paignton devon,5/28/16,"Broadband speed is not reliable,stops working for 10 minutes when watching a programme . Download speed takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour instead of couple of minutes. When is bt going to change the cable to better cable to carry the information that broadband requires .I have infinity 2 I do not recommend it not reliable to expensive."
Stephen todd,Thurso,5/28/16,BT is terrible. Their customer service is appalling and none of them know what they really talking about. So far I have spoken to bt pretty much every day for the past two weeks and been given 4-5 different excuses as to why my account isn't active. The latest one was because they have cancelled my order due to difficulties???? I am still waiting for a callback from them from a week ago from their complaints department... surprise surprise. Absolutely shocking company! How they have business I don't know???
Unhappy bt costumer,Cumbria,5/27/16,"Poor poor poor. PLEASE DO NOT USE BT!! I started a deal 4 years ago £5/month. Since then I've had poor costumer service, poor phone and broadband connections, have had previously free packages added to my bill and direct debit without notification, if you have a connection problem/fault you get an automated service or end up spiraling to someone in India. And my last bill came to £42!!! (We only use the unlimited broadband)
Disappointed doesn't even come close. They entice you in on a seemingly great deal. Trap you on 12m/18m multiple running phone and broadband deals. Then proceed to put up the prices and tell you it's all in the terms and conditions!! I'm looking to leave as my contract ends next month but I have to give them 30d notice to leave or 14d notice to switch supplier....even though my contact ends in 2 weeks anyway (....apparently that's in the terms and conditions also, even though I won't be in contact anymore). Summary:DO NOT USE BT!"
hayley,brighton,5/27/16,"WORST COMPANY EVER!!! staff don't know what is doing on, they are rude, they are clueless, plain stupid.

Too expensive for what it's worth, constantly getting things wrong. SO overcharged so glad my contract ended this month."
Mr B,Kent,5/25/16,"Having believed what I was told on the phone I placed an order for Fibre broadband, home phone and three mobile sims.

The sims arrived the next day and I set mine up. Number transfer happened the following day and caused 3-4 hours of no service.

It was then that I discovered that basic functionality was not supported. As an iPhone/iPad user, tethering devices is a way of life. BT disable it!
Visual voicemail either was not set up or is also not supported. So if you have devices you expect to share connection with ... BT refuses to enable this.

I discovered the lack of this basic feature whilst out on business calls, I had explained I needed this when ordering, caused me to need to change mobile provider. When I phoned to cancel (5 days after order) I was told I could not have a PAC code to move my number unless I could quote the account number (but email was on iPad and I could not tether to connect). I drove to a wifi hotspot, located account number and called back.

This new contact said, sorry to hear you need a PAC, but issued it without needing an account number.

So now I had been lied to twice! It has taken another six calls to try and cancel the order. Every time my new provider tries to take on the service they are blocked by BT saying they have a live order.

In summary, do not believe anuthing they say, their customer service, although polite is useless as what they promise does not get done. And as for their automated call answer service ... there is no polite way to describe it.

AVOID THEM, use any other company, don't put yourself through the pain!"

M scott,Lancashire,5/23/16,"I furthered a query I made last week, about new contract. I spoke to a very helpful man, who sorted my problem immediately and told me to then check my e mail, sure enough if was there explain g exactly the terms of my new contract, I couldn't fault the cstomer service,"
Boglar balazs,London,5/23/16,"DO NOT USE BT! This year was the first time that I have used BT for my broadband services and I completely regret it. Customer service is useless, you have to bug them over and over again to get anything done and it takes on average 10-20 minutes to get through to them. They made mistakes which led to me having issues and even my installation was delayed multiple times. They charge you for anything and everything and even the cancellation fees are more than with any other company. I will never use BT again and definitely recommend Sky or Virgin over them."
Thomas Robinson,Huddersfield,5/22/16,"I switched from Sky to BT a month ago and deeply regret it! BT`s ""Superfast fibre-optic"" achieves` a miserly 5.1 Mps broadband speed, despite their advertised speed of 23 Mps (GUARANTEED!) to 52 Mps. This speed is too slow for HD viewing of my chosen channels. BT admits the fault is ""At our end . . . ."" and are `working on it`. WHAT A RIP-OFF!"
Peter Owen,"Braintree, Essex",5/20/16,"I ordered services from BT and was told the order had failed on their system so they cancelled and told me they would raise again. I then received a call saying they where sorry I hadn't completed my order. Their system said it had been cancelled and not re ordered this is against what I had been told previously. I then stayed with my current supplier. However my credit card showed a charge from BT I called and they have said it will be refunded. They also said I had an active account but would not give me any details as I don't have the account number (I have not received any paperwork from BT after being told the order was cancelled). THe agent I spoke with would not help without me giving them the account number which I don't have. He then became rude when I asked to speak to a supervisor and refused to transfer me he just said he would post the account number and I had to call back. I have spent enough time on the phone with BT and can't believe how unhelpful and how much of a mess they have caused and stress for me on not knowing if I will lose my services. I am also concerned they may try to charge me and it may effect my credit score as I have cancelled the DD. I have not received any services from them and refuse to pay for their errors
I have never felt the need to escalate an issue but this time is different this is the worst service I have ever encountered."
Mrs. Lawrence,SWINDON,5/20/16,
Louise,"Garmouth, Moray",5/20/16,"We had a very reliable BT service until the end of March when we received a communication the exchange had been upgraded. Since then nothing but problems with broadband dropout, lights on the hub more flashing orange and orange than blue. Three engineers later and not a resolution in sight. The call centre in India are no help making you go through the same procedures time after time. There is nothing wrong with your line, we may have to charge you. What about any compensation due from BT for the inconvenience and frustration experienced. It is time BT came into the 21st century, we are not all touching our fetlocks saying yes master. DO SOMETHING - even if we live in a rural area we should not be treated like this."
Kevin Sisley,West Wickham,5/19/16,"So BT have provided me with 500Gb of free cloud storage, great. However, why can't BT provide customers with a User Guide that is usable to explain how to set-up / configure their cloud solution. A few bad YouTube videos and some appaling material on the net that does not reflect what the customer actually sees on their desktop will just not do."
Tony,Romford,5/18/16,
iain,Cambridge,5/18/16,"BT are terrible and have been for many years. I've had to use them twice due to circumstances beyond my control.

18 months into my contract and I'm still waiting for them to install a phone line. Took them 6 months to install internet.

Phoning customer support results in the call being dropped at a guess about 75% of the time. I've had to book days off work just to finish phone calls with BT. I've spent more than 4 hours in one sitting in the past without getting to a resolution (10th May 2016) and today I needed to book an engineer to come out and that phone call took an hour.

They've also signed me up to BT Sport for free initially, then started charging me for it. They said they informed me by email, but I receive an email from BT every couple of weeks that contains nothing but spam and so I happened to miss this, which they blamed me for.

Please please please, do whatever you can to avoid them."
Craig Lovely,Weston Super Mare,5/18/16,"Absolutely absurd to think I get 1.9mb speed, I spoke to BT just before buying my house 2 years ago and they assured me that works were due to take place to install fibre optic, not a single sign of an engineer, every time I call I'm told it's due to take place in 3-4 months, if I visit my brother in law who lives literally the other end of my road and use his WiFi, I get 55-60mb speed, it's an utter disgrace, not only are they liars, their customer service is diabolical and I cross my fingers that this new law gets passed where customers have to have a minimum broadband speeds. BT hang your heads in shame, yours sincerely a soon to be ex customer(p.a dial up is still head and shoulders above your lousy service)"
Dave,Chorleywood,5/18/16,
Nick,Northern Ireland,5/18/16,"The BT broadband is slow and has intermittent faults. Once it did not work for over a week with no compensation(still charged full bill for the service). The speed averaged 3mbps though this could occasionally drop as low as 0.25mbps. When I complained about the speed I was told I could upgrade to infinity for an additional £20 a month. £57 a month for a decent Internet connection is a lot so I declined.

When cancelling(after contract had ended), I was hit by a hidden ""cease charge"" of £31. At no point during the sign up was I told about this charge, even although I specifically asked for a break down of all costs. The sales team conveniently omitted this fact. What is the purpose of this charge? To me, it seems like BT are on a last rob before I finally leave them.

I would 100% recommend you avoid this company until they get their act together and provide a reliable, fast and transparent service."
Asif H,High Wycombe,5/18/16,"Absolute garbage customer service. Do not sign up wit BT. If you're moving home or try to leave BT, they will screw you over. Instead of accepting their mistake they penalise customers for leaving them. I'll never use BT ever again."
Goksel Osman,Chelmsford,5/17/16,"We left sky to come to bt, We ordered bt phone and broadband on the 25/4/16, we was told our services would go active on the 10/5/16, the day came, broadband speed was good but then it gradually got worse and worse until we got to the point that we couldn't even change the page, we made numerous phone calls complaining, was told by an Asian woman that we still had 9 days left to cancel if we werent happy, phoned today 17/5/16 which is 10 days after we became active only to be told that we can't cancel as we are out of our 10 days period from the date we ordered, we wasn't told any of that until we tried to cancel, but by have told us we can cancel but they will charge us £350 to end the contract when we was only told 2 days ago that we still have 9 days to cancel if we change our mind but now we want to cancel they want to charge us, we are leaving bt and going back to sky, at least sky are honest, bt are just a big conartist company who like to entrap their customers! Please please please don't go to bt, avoid like the plague, they are crooks, customer service are all Indian people who can't even speak English properly and their services are appalling!!!!"
stephen,carlisle,5/17/16,"after giving bt 15 years of being a loyal customer,i was forced to go part time at work,i phoned them last october to see if there was anything they could help me to reduce the monthly cost,they reduced my account by £10,i have now been made redundant and need to move away from my place and live with my brother and sister in law,i phoned bt yesterday to stop my service,and they are charging me £113.27 until next october,they said i changed my contract,when i get my own place and get on my feet again,i will never ever use bt again for anything"
Taylor,Derby,5/16/16,"I was currently with EE broadband had no issues with them the broadband was just a bit slow. So I changed to BT broadband. Since changing I have had no internet because it won't connect I have spoken to customer services and they say I will have to pay £129 and wait 4 days for he problem to be fixed! I have already paid around £56 first installation fee and also £35 a month. I have yet been able to use the Internet or make any phone calls. Service is unacceptable. I spoke to one of the managers called abhij and he was useless, he had no intention of sorting the issue out fast and for free as BT have already had a lot of money out of me and I have no broadband or phone line. Angry is a understatement."

Takes weeks to get someone out and look at it. They are happy to pocket your money with no service. Hud has more lights flashing on it from red, orange the blue then back to orange again. And they want to charge £28 a year more. Think Gavin Patterson better look for another job."

Norman Maclean,Western Isles,5/13/16,"BT a complete nightmare to deal with. The engineer did not turn up after me taking time off work. Worst of all has been the poor customer service - they never phone you back when they say they will. At times very difficult to understand what's being said. I was offered £10 compensation, I refused as I considered it an insult after everything I had been through. Once my contract is up I will leave, any other provider would be an improvement."
Aaron,Leicester,5/13/16,We currently have work and home BB with BT. I can honestly say this is terrible service and the BB always stops working. We are always calling them and the phone call takes on average 1 hour waiting time. Do not use them terrible service.
Matt,Carlisle,5/11/16,"I echo all of the other comments, I've wasted so much time, and life should not be this difficult. If I could give Zero starts I would.
Advice is NEVER EVER USE BT for TV or Broadband. Don't say I didn't warn you.
As the Bill payer and overall person in charge of such things, there has been anarchy in my household, with 3 adult daughters, and a wife all totally peed off, they have lost all respect and patience, and its all my fault!
Counting down so I can leave them."
David Suckling,Durham,5/9/16,"Never use this company, their customer service is a joke. I have been on the phone to them for three hours today and am still no further forward. Waited in all day today for an engineer visit, no engineer showed and no phone call to let me know. When questioned on this I have been given a pack of lies ranging from no engineer was booked, to an engineer was booked but did not need access to my property then eventually I have been informed tonight that an engineer was booked but the booking got lost in the system. Please please please do not make the mistake I have made, never sign up for BT broadband"
shaie rahulan,london,5/9/16,"They will say anything to get you to sign on. They will reel you in with the cheap advertising but once signed on they will add little charges here and there.

If you ask them if there would be any additional charges they will tell you no but they will only say that to sign the contract. After that it will be too late.

That's how they got me. Be careful people."
Margarete Crane,Pembrokeshire South Wales,5/9/16,"Dreadful service promised to call back within 24 hours it doesn't happen, excuses, I was without any BB service for six weeks in 2015 again now no email tech help desk level 2 called when I threatened to cancel shouting at me over phone received text all sorted I replied NO five days ago still no callback!!! I will find a more reliable provider after 40+ years a customer it's shocking!!! I wouldn't recommend to anyone!!!!"
Martin,Littlehampoton,5/8/16,"Have been a BT customer for many years. Have had few problems and overall fairly satisfied. However their impending price hikes are the last straw for me. My research tells me and I'm going for another providers package for about 1/3rd of my current BT Tarrif. The BT new prices email which I got recently promises a 500GB cloud which I don't need, Best Ever security which I don't need either and the promise to fix faults faster....Would much prefer a promise for their customer services to respond more quickly with less dreaded option selections, a lot shorter wait in queues with the constant repeat of the expression ""Your call is important""
Also very disappointed with BT sport.After the football season there's likely to be absolutely nothing I'm personally interested in watching"
M,Dorset,5/7/16,"Went back to BT as it seemed competitive and quick to get set up. Answered questions on needs, don't watch live streaming download films etc so package sold should be enough. Wasn't strong enough to look at facebook, broadband stopped customer service unhelpful. Emailed that engineer was coming on more than one time but no emails because of no internet!!! but still charged,Will never use again Shocking all around."
Andres mitchell,Carlisle,5/6/16,"What a useless company this is today received Email telling me my bill is going up by £4.65 or 11%. No explanation, nothing. When I try to log in to sort out using CORRECT details ,it says not recognised so cannot complain. So my bill goes up 10% with no comeback other that to leave...which is exactly what I will do. If you haven't joined BT please please don't. They are a bunch of cheats who despite billions of current year profits have increased current charges by 10% ..or higher. Disgraceful. Andrew Mitchell. CA89BA"
Paul Burke,North Yorkshire,5/5/16,"The worst company ever to deal with. Sold me a dream and have yet to deliver - a complete nightmare from start to finish. Libby Barr promises the earth and delivers Hell. many emails and texts telling me it's coming - the greatest experience of my life. on the day of installation, many texts telling me 'Simon is on his way, be in' I was. then a text, 'Simon is here' Whoop whoop, Libby has whipped me up into a frenzy. But wait, Simon calls... Sorry Open reach have directed your line to the wrong exchange (something Simon told me they do often). ""What happens now I ask"" he stated he would file a report and they would be in touch. They weren't. many weeks later, over 100 operatives , over 27hrs on the phone, live chatting and tweeting BTCare (#BTDontCare). i still have no idea when they are going to install. the most awful experience ever. avoid them like the plague. no wonder they are the bottom of trustpiolt reviews. TAKE THIS AS A WORD OF CAUTION. I am sure, when it goes right it's great. but if it goes wrong, it goes disastrously wrong and good old Libby, is upstairs taking fares. get your act together BT you don't deserve the millions of customers and rather than spend millions of getting Mr Bacon to tell us all how wonderful things are, invest in some decent customer service processes and take ownership of this pitiful experience. SHAME ON YOU BT"
Ernest,Belfast BT8 8DA,5/5/16,"Leaving BT today Appalling customer service, billing incomprehensible both written and verbal. Institutional rip off the worst kind. Do not use these idiots"
Nancy,Middlewich,5/4/16,"Paid for BT Infinity2 - realised that my speeds weren't correct, so did a speed check. 19mbps! Phoned them up. Said an engineer was booked, then received emails and phone calls saying it was an exchange problem, so the engineer was cancelled. Went out on the day the engineer was supposed to come, thinking that it had been cancelled, only to get a phone call from the engineer saying he was on his way. Apparently the lines coming into my house were the wrong type for infinity 2. Once he sorted the setup, the internet speed hadn't improved, so after visiting the junction box, he informed me that there were 'manhole' repairs to be performed. I've had my BT contract for over 6 months and paying for the infinity 2 service, but didn't have the correct setup coming into my house. I keep getting passed from pillar to post. The customer services staff agree with all you say, but nothing actually gets done to solve the problem. I'm getting to the point I want to wring someone's neck, but there is no one there with responsibility.
I am sooooo frustrated!!!"
Vici crole,Northumberland,5/3/16,"We changed from sky to BT. BIGGEST mistake! Half the equipt didn't turn up in time, so 2 engineer appts had to be made. Now the broadband is sooooo slow. Can't get half the channels. Customer service has told me to check google to see signal strength. Something I thought they would do prior to ordering the service.
They just want yr money and do not care if things are not right. Do NOT go with BT infinity !!!!"
WaitingForAnswer,London,5/3/16,"This is about the BT fibre to home service. A complete joke. I have been waiting for the order (paid in March 2016) for 6 weeks now but the orders (yes, re-ordered) kept got cancelled without telling me the reason. The only way to contact is through 08005874787 and you have to wait for at least 15 minutes to get to talk to someone who doesn't know the answer to your problem. The problem is it's a new built and BT provided the router system so no other providers can set up the broadband service for me except BT--- Monopoly is really bad for consumers --- a new evidence! Just now I called and was told to wait for a call from them, just like what happen on Last Friday. I never got the Call! Please tell me how I can make a complain! It is terrible! what's wrong with BT!"
Nicola,Ely,5/2/16,"Forever having direct debit problems on monthly payment plan of £53 a month so I can budget, BT just help themselves to double from my account most months and I have tried to call numerous times to rectify and it goes back to normal for a month then back to double payments again. Have been cut off by rude indian staff numerous times after spending half hour explaining the situation. One woman ""anya"" was so rude on the phone to me and shouting I said I would report and she said she didnt care and hung up!! Worst customer service ever they have no clue and spin you stories and are very rude!"
Darren,Basingstoke,5/2/16,"The customer service reps are completely Useless. I had intermittent internet connection for about 4 months where suddenly the connection would drop and not connect again. I had to get 3 bt engineers out which all said there was nothing wrong even when they saw the problem happening. This resulted in my diagnosing the issue myself and actually fixing it myself! The came a time which now my BT Vision box doesnt work, my recordings fail or my chanels get Pixelated. broadband and aerial are fine which all points to the box. BT would not swap this out for me but sent an engineer out who was 2 hours late and all he did was a rest on the box. The following dady i checked and it still wasnt working so going back to BT they not expect me to run all these checks again! The customer service and engineers are useless so dont waste your money on this company go for a better one where you will get the service you pay for!"
Tom,Shrewsbury,5/1/16,As a new customer I was told it would be two weeks before I receive my router this was the quickest they could send one out. I recieved the router exactly two weeks later and installed it only to find that when they said it would go live it didn't. After phoning the customer service number I was informed after 40 minutes waiting I was talking to someone in India which is where the BT customer service team is based. When i informed them of my lack of service they informed me it would be fixed within 48 hours. Now 72 hours later I rang them back where I was told it will not be fixed for another 4 days. This means from initially starting my contract with BT it will of been 3 weeks before I have the chance of internet. The customer service is shoddy and 'british telecom' seem to have no interest in the British customer. Appaling.
Paul,wickford,5/1/16,"DON'T USE THIS COMPANY... MISS SELLING IS RIFE... Think of the worst double glazing company and x it by 10.. We were missed sold the package by a telephone sales rep... He promised 4 times faster connection then our existing SKY broadband, and that we could connect 7 wireless devices.... Well we are sitting here with less then 1 meg and unable to connect any devices wirelessly... It took over 1 hour to down load a film on sky.... BT take no responsibility for the false promises made and completely disregard the fact that there representative lied and missed sold... We are now left stuck in battle to increase the speed of our broadband so me and my family can live life how we used to.... BT's answer "" YOU CAN UPGRADE FOR AN ADDITIONAL £18.00 PER MONTH"" This is an obvious plan to sell poor quality products and service and false people into having to upgrade... TERRIBLE COMPANY THAT DESERVES TO GO BANKRUPT. LESS THANK 1 STAR"
Dave,Pontypool,4/30/16,"Awful, just awful.

I upgraded to Infinity last year, but in the past 2 months the amount of dropping out that is going on is so bad that I am now losing money because of the constant unreliability issues of BT infinity.

I have had an Engineer visit my property on 3 occasions in the past month only to tell me I have nothing wrong with my internet connection, etc, etc.

However, the person I am dealing with at BT agrees that I have issues as he has been monitoring it, but apparently he unable to advice on whether I can get out of my contract in order to go to Sky Fibre without a massive charge from BT for the remainder of my contract. Even though that BT are in breach of their own terms, I am unable to get out of the contract, even if the person at BT who has been monitoring the issues agrees that I have issues with my broadband, but they are unable to rectify those issues by simply allowing me to get out of my contract.

So he admits I have these problems and they are not honoring their own service contract, but I am unable to get out of it, ha ha. Awful company that insults my intelligence and I am sure many other peoples intelligence.

They are a joke of a communications company, and my telephone and broadband spend is annually around £2000+. Well they can F off because that business on the two lines I have in my house, including my home office and broadband are all going to Sky as soon as I can get away from BT.

The way they have handled this problem has been just utterly stressful and inept.

The loss of money I have had due to one specific day where the router crashed 14 times, yes 14 times in an afternoon was just stressful and completely unacceptable. I am going to seek legal advice on how to force BT to let me out of the contract and also seek substantial damages for the loss of £ due to the unreliability of their inept infinity service.

I will also add, that BT throttle the network everyone. I know this from a friend of mine who just happens to be a BT Engineer who has worked for BT for 20 years, has basically spilled the beans as to why I really have issues with my Broadband and why so many BT customers have issues, it is because they throttle the network to boost other areas of the network. Obviously this is completely illegal and BT are walking on really thin ice.

I have had enough of BT, the stress of dealing with them, they are the most inept company that I have ever dealt with.

I am going to sue them for damages and I am going to go public with my findings about how they throttle the network. BT made the wrong move by aggravating me. Now it is my turn to cause them stress and embarrassment along the way.

1/10 for BT in general. Sky offer a far superior service. They may not be the fastest, but they are more reliable and far cheaper to use.

Virgin like BT are inept as well from what I understand, and they too have been from what I hear been throttling the network. Completely illegal, and I hope they get massively fined for it one day and taught a lesson."
Simone Regina Lourenco,newmarket,4/30/16,"Speed to low , lost conection every day , not happy , they dont do anything.Hard to talk long waiting time , when talk nothing happens ."
nigel,mistley,4/30/16,"The great BT con. We went with BT because they promised a reliable service oh what a mistake. 6 mths down the line we find ourselves trapped with a shambolic result. Promised with a minimum of 3mb ( which is still pathetic) and a promise of a get out if it fails our average for the past month is .79 yet because it reaches 3 at least once a week they want £ 180 to terminate the contract, con being the operative par. our neighbour has managed to sort them out but only after legal action and we don't have that sort of cash to throw away. meanwhile we are stuck with helplines that don't speak English and a useless service. WARNING stay away from BT"
Aly,West Cumbria,4/29/16,"SAVE YOUR MONEY--FOR A COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THEY ARE A HUGE FRUSTRATING JOKE.
We have switched from SKY and their ever increasing costs and lack of loyalty to loyal customers, to BT INFINITY 2 home hub 5. Plus the TV package etc. In addition we requested a landline and Internet installation at our houseboat ( that's a whole other sorry tale)
The speeds are rubbish, the connection constantly drops out and streaming is useless.
According to BT there is no problem, and they have suggested lots of technical things WE could do to try to improve connection and speeds, as well as things like not having more than 1 device connected, moving the modem into the middle of the house, not trying to use the Internet whilst watching a film......I could go on but REALLY.
Our house isn't large,and there's only us 2 old codgers in it.We aren't technically knowledgeable nor are we engineers, so the technical suggestions they have made might as well have been in Chinese, all we want is to be able to switch on, watch to/ movies/sports and check e nails/ browse the web and download books and music, I don't believe any of these things place huge demand on the poor old broadband, but it seems they completely overtax it.
I have moved all electrical apparatus away although the tv is kind of integral to the package! I draw the line at knocking down walls, and majority of the time I'm sat no more than 10 feet from the router.
I had the installation done by their engineers, but despite this it's still rubbish.
Wish we could get Virgin in our area, but for now looks like I will have to go back to SKY and their slow expensive but reliable service. COUNTING THE DAYS tick tiock"
steve,worksop,4/29/16,"where do I begin.....just dont use them, I went online ordered infinity2, they gave me date for two weeks and.... well nothing happened so I called back in.
on hold for 10 mins as is the norm and a bloke answered, kept me on hold for 10 mins to speak to someone who may help me but put me through to another department without saying anything, guess what another 10 mins on hold then a very unhelpful lady from India said the reason I had not got the broadband was the order I put in hadn't gone through and that it was my fault , so I queried why I had been given a date and why someone had called me to check the line number was correct to which she said I have cancelled your order and you will have to go back on again and carry out another order..... so I replied you have been most unhelpful, thank you very much for cancelling the order you have saved me some time goodbye."
Kim,Folkestone,4/28/16,"We moved over to BT Infinity having been promised wonderful connection throughout the house.... They lied! We can only get broadband in the room where the hub is situated.

I caught my husband sobbing when he realised that if I wanted to be on the computer in the study then he couldn't watch TV through sky connect. I now have the hub as a wonderful ornament in the hallway, by the lounge door, whilst I sit in the kitchen with my Ipad - still wondering what I can use my study for!

I contacted BT, Consumer Services are extremely rude and unhelpful. I can leave BT if I pay £700 - yipee, so stuck with them for another 9 long months, but leave them I shall.

If you're looking for a decent broadband provider AVOID BT"
Dr Shelina Hetherington,Herefordshire,4/28/16,"I am disgusted with the poor customer service. I was with Fleur telecom who are exellent, but dont provide fibre in this area. So i signed up for fibre with BT. External works due then a week later internal works. External engineer did not do the job, no one kept us informed, then today the day before the connection was due, openreach phoned to say they cant do the connection as the external work hasn't been done. BT customer services said they would still be cutting me off tomorrow for an undetermined length of time. THe engineer would give a report within 2 weeks! I told them i am a GP and work from home out of hours telephone triage for emergencies. they said it made no difference. I said it was entirely their error why cant they stop the cut off, they said it's at the stage of no retur. I asked to speak to a manager and am awaiting the call back. I am gobsmacked at the appauling service. Entirely their error but absolutley no acknowlegement and no concern for my livelihood nor patient's lives. Plus they have taken £74.11 out of my account without having provided the service and still want to cut me off! I phoned Fleur telecom who were brilliant as usual. They have put a stop on any hand over to BT for tomorrow so hopefully that will work. I will be cancelling the fibre broadband package with BT even though it's over the cooling off period so no doubt they will want to charge me. I will be contacting DSA and taking this further. THey have not delivered on their contract and therefore i will not pay. What a lousy company. I will never go with BT again."
mr salt,leicester,4/28/16,"The worst service i have ever came accross. Priced way to high. It took over 1 hour and 4 differnt departments. 1 in india and 3 other cities in the uk.
How old peaple get anywhere with them i dred to think. But that is how they rip customers off.
No loyalty from them.vafter 40 years.
Stay clear"
Sylvia,London,4/28/16,"I switched from talk talk to BT 18 months ago as they had a good deal and we're offering 50£ worth of vouchers yet all that was not worth it ... speeds are same or worse than TT prices higher, customer service useless ... Oh and forgot to mention that no sign of that promised 50£ Voucher (said that I do not qualify as I requested it too late ... 6 month time limit and I filled the form on 3rd month so I was basically robbed) switching to plus net now. Cheers"
Mohammad,Nelson,4/28/16,"Switched from copperwire broadband to the fibre optic (infinity broadband) 54mbps allegedly getting between 30-35mbps. Switched because old broadband was around 17mbps, also router kept resetting, was told because we were running too many devices at once? The hub was struggling and that the new hub could handle the load much better, however still getting the same problems as before, internet keeps dropping whilst watching youtube or facetime, even dropped whilst playing xbox online at 2am with no other devices connected!"
Upset customer,London,4/27/16,"The worst customer service in history! First, the order was messed up. This delayed the installation by 2 weeks! Then the engineer did not show up on my day off that I took specifically for that!!!!!!! Then I was 3 hours on the phone to find out what happened! Them they refused to schedule an appointment for a more specific time! Then they forgot to send me a confirmation of a new date! We are ready to take a legal action!!!!!!!"
Vix,Basingstoke,4/27/16,The worst I have experienced since days of NTL! So far on-hold for 50 mins without speaking to someone. WTF? If I could give no stars or minus I would. 100% dissatisfied.
Peter,Glasgow,4/26/16,"I can not wait for November when my BT contract is up. From broadband speed to billing to customer care, the whole experience has been abysmal."
John,Glasgow,4/26/16,"Quite possibly the single worst experience iv had in dealing with any company .
when I was getting an intermittent fault with the net going offline 5-6 times a day when I asked the BT agent why should I have to pay for a service like this the reply was ""thats just the way it is ""
Im now with plusnet !"
Oedipus,London,4/24/16,"Just finishing my 1st years contract with BT Broadband, it was like a farce at the theatre, suddenly cancelled my service by mistake and tried to charge me £55, this involved many many calls to India where no one listened or changed anything, have been complaining about the drop out (can't actually use wireless unless Im literally standing over the router and even then its intermittent) but it took nearly 8 months for them to send a new one! Have now signed up with another provider and they are blocking the transfer, I have complained officially, no response, called and wasted several hours of my life being put through to various useless people who DONT help, now finally had enough - DONT USE THIS COMPANY!"
Paul,East Boldon,4/23/16,I have infinity 2 and get less than infinity 1 speeds - It was better until I cancelled BT Vision - now they are saying line speeds have increased but ours has fallen by around 5mbs and the drop out rate has increased. They give it away to new customers but charge older ones more and ore fort less and less service and trying to contact them or get a straight response is beyond my comprehension. Overall pretty dismal service.
Tim,Wigan,4/22/16,"Cant describe the frustration , original connection date 07/03/16 now quoting 05/05/16 . Have spent 90 minutes , 25 minutes, 45 minutes, 45 minutes on the phone . The result each time? they hang up . Don't go near them."
Lea,London,4/21/16,"I've had BT for over a year and the first year was fine.

Then this month my broadband went down 3 times for a total of 2 weeks and my phone went down for 1 week. BT decided instead of refunding me for 1/2 the MONTH of broadband and 1 week of the phone, they would refund me for 1/2 a WEEK of broadband and 1 week of phone. Seems a bit unfair doesn't it."
David,Rural,4/21/16,"Broadband drop out rate unacceptable. Frustrating, time wasting calls to India with no resolution, line refreshed, no more problems. Do they not keep a log of the number of call received from the same person, every time you have to go over and over the same things again. Might I remind BT we are still being charged for this very ineffective service. It is all very well to say do things on line, most of the time you cannot get on line. We had four emails regarding the engineer who supposedly came to fix the problem, guess what we could not read them until he had left and BT deemed it acceptable to let us have an Internet connection for a few hours.
Thoroughly disgusted."
robert,Froxfield,4/21/16,"If I could go any lower I would. The service is at best awful. Villagers refer to it as ""snailnet"""
Lorraine Brown,London,4/20/16,"I have fibre optic 76Mbs I get about 60. BUT it seems everytime a BT Openreach guy shows up to do something with the exchange box on the street my connection drops. This happens about 4-5 times a week.
Recently my phone & broadband went down and I looked and saw the Openreach guy at the box. It never came back up. I have called everything single day for a week and get the roundaround from a support centre in India somewhere. No one calls back, and they keep saying it will be fixed today.

DISGUSTING. I tried to raise a complaint and the customer service person said there was no Complaints Dept at BT!

Clearly they don't have enough engineers and the support desk lie."
Matthew,Wales,4/20/16,"I cannot put across strongly enough how many problems BT have caused through a simple telephone system office install, not to mention the extreme costs quoted by inexperience's representatives.

No care in the world for any downtime for our company or cost and time taken to fix the problem that were created needlessly after multiple conversations about the same thing.

Internal accounting processes are shocking and everything promised or anything amended goes wrong (I mean EVERYTHING). Not one representative that visited us knew what the plan was after a total of 6 x meetings and multiple engineering visits. The wrong equipment was supplied for which we were charged after advising multiple people BT;s end about the incorrect delivery. Delays of over 2 months for office renervation all down to BT and lack of planning.

Very unprofessional as a whole and not impressed at all, will be pulling plug on BT as soon as i am able.

I will never be using BT again for commercial or private use out of principle - Terrible service! - DO NOT USE"
lee bunting,belfast,4/20/16,"worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life!! so my broadband was due to renew, was offered an ok deal to stay with bt, so said yes to it, after being in phone for 1 hour, for some reason they couldn't load the order,put me through to guy in india, he said he couldn't fix it and I would get a call back on Monday( this was Friday. Mondays call didn't come, so phoned Tuesday as my deal was due to expire on the Thursday, girl answered put me on hold for 30 minutes, then line goes dead. called back again next day to be told all sorted, got home Thursday night service cancelled. called bt next day, got cheeky girl on other end who started to ask why didn't I call last night?? obviously my call was an inconvenience to her, asked for her name to complain, she wouldn't give me her full name, and proceeded to argue with me for the call. so told I would get call back , guess what call didn't come. so iv phoned bt 14 times totalling around 4 hours on phone, each time explaining my situation again. each time bar 1 get a defensive person on other line who proceeds to argue with me, customer service is obviously something that bt don't care about. week on and still no issue resolved, each day I have to phone and go through scenario all over again and get promised a call back that never comes. last call girl actually had the cheek to say they have been trying to call me. so if you want bad service, you want to frustrate yourself and get nothing in return and abused by call centre staff and listen to hold music for 40 minutes at a time, join bt, I know I really regret it. such a shame that what was once a great national company has let itself go this badly."
DM,Northamptonshire,4/19/16,I changed provider from TalkTalk to BT because TalkTalk we're unable to provide fibre. But the change over was far from smooth and BT left me without internet access for 3 working days. This could have been avoided but BT don't care.
Darren o'hanlon,Garvaghey,4/17/16,
XYZ etc,South Bucks,4/16/16,"On the 76MB 'Pro' package. Connectivity consistently drops throughout the day, and speeds when connectivity is available is comedically short of the 76Mb headline speed. On a good day wifi speeds are around 2mb and hard wired speeds closer to 6mb. Utter joke. Unfortunately Virgin Media isn't available, so only alternative option is to stick with whichever ISP chooses to front the BT 76Mb service claim."
Alberto,Manchester,4/16/16,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!
One of the slowest connection ever tried. The signal keeps dropping 'till there's no connection at all. I have been calling them for 1 month for having it fixed. After 1 month they send an ""engineer"" who only change the socket and guess what? problem still running"
Paul,Milton Keynes,4/15/16,Would be no stars if possible. Having read all the other previous reviews what more can I add? Joining BT was a massive error and I will be leaving asap!
Carr,Southampton,4/15/16,"Very poor service. BBand sppeeds of about 0.2 - and after some weeks, BT admit speed was restricted due to connection issues.
Do not understand why they did not tell me this when the line was restricted.
Need to change supplier!"
Lisa,Staffordshire,4/14/16,Probably the worst company I have ever had dealings with.The equipment never turned up for ten days and only then when I sent in two letters complaining.I asked theam to cancel within the 14 days they still carried on.When I asked for a credit for the 10 days of service I missed out on they said yes.Then stopped my account as I didn't pay.The reason I didn't pay I was awaiting a credit.Told them to shut it all down cost £137 for 2 months and for ten days of that I didn't have a service but still got charged.Ensure your equipment arrives before the package and within the 14 day cancellation.I have had to pay for their mistakes but it was the only way I could get rid of them.Call themselves British they should be ashamed of the service they provide or not.
m carr,seaham,4/14/16,changed to bt for fibre optics nothing is working properly.my old supplier both phone & broadband worked ok but slow.but now its hit or miss it took 5 extra days to put in iv had to take one phone out its not compatible!yet it was working before. big mistake changing
Lance,Northampton,4/12/16,"Shockingly bad service -- it's impossible to get help on the call centre and you won't get any real help when you manage to speak to someone. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
Carlos C,NW116AT,4/12/16,I changed from Sky to BT to get their infinity package's promised speed. First of all. My connection was not changed. They kept me on the cooper wire. Connection drops so often that is ridiculous. I should have stayed with slower but more reliable connection
Anya,Bushey,4/12/16,"Our internet crashed today, not great when you're working in a busy office that relies heavily on the internet. I spoke to Val from BT who was very helpful and incredibly patient considering I did not have a lot of the information needed to help her work out the problem. She got our internet back up and running again and was very friendly to talk to. Thanks Val!"
Nick Swan,Kingsclere,4/12/16,"Extremely poor service especially when trying to report a problem -(aways foreign speaking engineers you cannot understand them and they cannot understand you, and the problem doesn't always get resolved) in contrast should you require to purchase something you get clear and precise english speaking assistants.
overall a very very disappointing broadband service"
Karen,Staffordshire,4/9/16,"I have a basic BT broadband package as we are still on the copper wire network, so paying extra for Infinity is pointless. WHEN it works, the speed is fine, but it drops out at least once an hour, usually for about 5-10 minutes, so streaming live movies is a test of my patience. BT customer service is appalling. After waiting 20-30 minutes to actually speak to someone, they just respond with a sales pitch for Infinity. Their website is as unreliable as the rest of their internet services. I have been trying to set up a secondary email for a family member. It's a relatively easy process (if it were with any other provider) but the BT website keeps crashing on the final page and, you guessed it, no-one to fix the problem and I'm now on the fourth DAY of attempting it. I have 8 months left on my contract but I can't seem to find a provider who actually provides the service they advertise. I'm not asking for some all singing service that will run a space station full of live games, just a very basic, reliable internet service."
Nigel Matthews,Foulden,4/9/16,When you go to desk top help and they tell you (1) Switch off the power supply at the socket or pull the power lead from the back of your hub. (2) Wait for the green light to come on you know something's not right
H Thomson,Scotland,4/8/16,"The service has always been poor. Now BT have introduced Open zone locally, the service drops 4-10 times an hour. BT like to tell me the speed is good at the local exchange - but that's not where I live."
Mike W,North Devon,4/7/16,Diabolical speed from BT (1MB ONLY!) Supposedly upgraded Shebbear exchange. Waste of money.... no better than before. Fibre cables put in to within 200m of property but have they offered to connect us to provide AT LEAST the 8MB we are supposed to be able to get? HAVE THEY HECK! Just can't be bothered. No doubt the excuse is 'not enough customers in our post code so get lost!'
Tom,,4/7/16,"Worst, sorry excuse of a company I have ever had the displeasure of coming across. Do yourself a favour and switch to people who don't scam you of your money. I don't recommend these utter scammers at all."
Osric,Kent,4/6/16,"First of all I have to say I resent giving even one star because BT really deserve a big fat zero.

Having been with TalkTalk I decided to move across to BT Infinity when I moved house. I called and went through the order process, and was advised that BT would sequester my existing number from TalkTalk and move the service across to coincide with my move in February 2015. Cool! I paid a years line rental up front along with an extortionate connection fee and looked forward to my super fast internet and phone service.

The first red flag was when the engineer didn't turn up as booked. I called BT and was connected to their call centre in India, and was informed that the work had been carried out remotely and my service would be active before midnight. The following day I had a dialling tone (RESULT!) However, when i called my home number the phone didn't ring. I call call out but couldn't receive incoming calls and the internet was S.....L....O....W....

After many, MANY weeks of dealing with the same individual in India, (I didn't request the same person - she was the only operative who ever answered the phone) I was getting nowhere. Then, out of the blue TalkTalk emailed me my latest bill.

Um... How can this be when BT provide my service?

Well, it turned out that BT had never adopted the line but had partially switched it at the exchange. Soooooo, when I called out it was with BT, but incoming calls were received via TalkTalk....wait for it.... AT MY OLD HOUSE!!!!!

Isn't that brilliant?! Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.

I called BT again...and got through to the same person in India again...and I explained the situation again...and she promised me she would fix it again...

In fact she promised me she would fix it by the following day and then call me to make sure everything was working as it should be. No one called.

I called BT again... and got through to the same person again... She told me she had actually tried to call me the previous day, but no one had answered.

Um... because it didn't ring. That was the issue in the first place!


This went on and on for months. Me pleading, begging and eventually threatening. Them nodding, smiling and doing nothing. Eventually I did manage to get the phone issue sorted, but only after a very nice man at TalkTalk offered to contact BT and idiot talk them through the line transfer process. (Thank you TalkTalk, I'll be back as soon as Im out of contract).

Anyway, to cut a long story short-(ish), its a year on, I now have phone service, but I'm paying for BT Infinity whilst they provide regular broadband. Aaaaand I've yet to receive the refund i was promised.

But it's ok... they're working on it.

Don't do it people. Buy your broadband elsewhere. Life is just too short."
Mark,Taunton,4/5/16,
Kevin Majmudar,London,4/5/16,"It took over 4+ months by BT in LONDON to get my Fibre up and running which previously had been running PERFECTLY for 2 years. Terrible customer service, multiple engineers visits (6) often out of the blue and essentially an organisation who has no idea about it's core business anymore. Was offered £4 compensation for over 6 months of useless customer service that often suffered from drop outs and took my complaint to the highest level. When you do they then mess with your connection further as you've black listed and it would stop every so often. I work in the IT industry so know how things run and often was told the problem was always in my end, i.e. home and not their network whilst i knew otherwise and fought them to address it. You're consistently threatened with charges if you're found to be wrong so it's a VERY good thing i know whats's what and refused their rubbish assumptions and analysis. Avoid BT like the plague!!! Z**** Have moved to Virgin Media and their worlds apart. BT should be broken up and sold off it has no idea what it's doing anymore!!!!!!! Will never use AGAIN!!! 18 months of pure crap!"
Robin,Woodside Perthshire,4/4/16,Used to be excellent now really dire
Sean,New Malden,4/4/16,
Gary,North Yorkshire,4/4/16,"BT are by far the worst large company I have ever had to deal with.

I have had an intermittent broadband fault for over a year that many competent providers would have diagnosed and fixed but not BT.

The customer service (only good thing is 150 is free) frequently has delays of 30 minutes plus, 9 times out of 10 you deal with off-shore call centres who do not have much knowledge and are difficult to converse with and on two occasions hung up on me (no swearing or shouting either).

When you do complain this falls on deaf ears and the promised callbacks fail to be honored even when they send texts confirming the date and time.

As an organization they have become a joke in terms of customer service, even in a non-fault related manner there ordering process is a comedy of errors.

Finally when BT stuffs up most major suppliers would offer a bit of compensation as a way of goodwill, however with BT you have to plead your case and when they finally pay out this is a computer calculated amount of a pittance that bears no relation to the stress you will have endured dealing with them.

If you can choose anyone other than BT I would advise you to seriously consider your health and mental sanity before joining them."
Mal,Manchester,4/3/16,"Terrible customer service. Disconneting calls, staff saying over and over this same without listening, not helpful at all. Delay with connections, no help during the weekend. Sending not updated bill. Broadband slower than others company. AVOID"
Harry,Midlands,4/2/16,"BT infinity with Hub 5 - dont bother.
The speed is not the issue. Works fine when it works but it constantly drops and BT have no idea why.
Have had 4 routers in 18 months. Still got issues now.
Once the router failed completely and had to wait 3 days for a call back only to say they will order me a new one. Another 3 day wait.
Connects to andriod most times but hates Iphone for some reason.
18 months is over so now cancelled. Sky was better before even if slower."
Miguel Angel,London,4/2/16,"Terrible, never again. They will cheat you overcharging for things you never asked for and never solve the disputes.
Avoid like hell"
Chris Newman,Cornwall,4/1/16,"Well, after having the one with terrible customer service (Talktalk), the one owned by BT (Plusnet) and BT itself now I can honestly say that BT'S broadband is the least reliable of them all. Plusnet and Talktalk provided faultless service however Plusnet does have the edge on customer service. I will be leaving BT at the end of my 12 month contract!"

Andrew mcelroy,Didcot,3/31/16,"That star was a mistake.
I contacted BT over a month ago to give plenty of time for them to sort my connection in my new build property . I told them the house was fibere but I was told BT won't know that until I order a phone line which I did 2 weeks later I had a call telling me it had been cancelled by open reach so I would have to put a fresh order in . So I did this an another 2weeks passed and I got a call saying it had been cancelled again. Next excuse was I was ringing the wrong department which just happened to be the same number ? This is still ongoing and I am in the property without phone or Internet BT are the worst business I have ever had the misfortune to deal with . If you have the choice avoid them"
G W,York,3/30/16,"I have just returned to BT after many happy years with talk talk.. mainly because I wanted a cashback deal and a bt deal. I left BT originally because of the appalling service. My recent experiences tell me nothing has changed. They give dates for installation which they dont keep, the engineers dont know what systems they have to use i.e. They told me that they had no cable in my area and cancelled. The admin team told me they did so they reinstated my order. To cut along story short I have no tv, no broadband and no landline as talk talk have now cancelled and BT cant do anything for anither week. I am 20 days past the original instllation date. Absolutely uselss"
Ben Williams,London,3/30/16,"So bad I'm assuming must be a joke. Ironically after the latest delay with installation they said ""Don't worry ... we will call you back on 1 April"".

Ordered BT TV, internet (as well as the obligatory telephone line) 6 weeks ago. Since then I have had 26 phone calls, 15 hours of my life wasted, 1 unexplained non-attendance by an engineer and
5 occasions having the Indian colleagues guys putting the phone down on me when they didn't know what to say.

I STILL do not have television. AND spent the last hour on the phone speaking to 4 different people to find out what was going on (3 of them couldn't).

The promise I will have TV tomorrow. But they promised this on Tuesday but then sent me a text saying there was a technical fault

Without doubt one of the worst product / customer service experiences I have ever had anywhere in the world."
Martn,Bishops Stortford,3/29/16,"Thinking of switching to BT Broadband, DONT. I switched from Talk Talk due to slow speeds and poor customer service but believe me TalkTalk seems to be infinitely better than BT. Firstly we were left 1 week without internet connection at the switch. A very poor standard of call centre customer service officer told us that the problem was the Hub that they sent us. They sent a second which also didn't work so an engineer was called who got us up and running. It was not the hub at all. Unfortunately we now find that the speed is well below the TalkTalk speed we tried to move away from. The final irony is that our internet speed is so slow that we can't even run the BT speed tester!"
Andrey,ILFORD,3/29/16,"For me now BT is a synonym of horrible, I never have so many problems with any providers as with BT.
I lived in several countries, used about 7 int. providers.
But never, I mean never, had so many problems as with BT
I have a contract with BT since 2011 in all those years random disconnects, speed drops, in all those years our property visit so many engineers that I lost my count.
I think I had less girlfriends in all my life, then engineers visiting our property.
And guess what, when I tried to cancel the contract, because I've had enough of...
They said that's impossible unless I pay termination fees of 100 something.
Sorry for my bad English!"
T Sepi,,3/28/16,"Random disconnects happen far too often, even if I'm metres away from the hub. It can't be relied on. It took too long to find someone in customer support that actually cared. I seriously don't recommend."
Graeme Sims,"Llanover,Abergavenny",3/28/16,"erratic, unstable ,non existent customer service . I see Openreach vans every day but what they are working on ,only heaven knows"
Sarah,Eastleigh,3/28/16,I moved house in January and took 2 weeks and many hours of phone calls to get my broadband infinity connected as the original order was cancelled but the new order was not put in by the customer service assistant they then charged a £130 connection fee even though i was an existing customer and again several phone calls to get my money back. one of the calls lasted 2 hours and i was put through to 8 different people. Absolutely appalling service. I am now trying to upgrade my TV package and have been informed there is a fault on my account. I was told last weekend after speaking to 3 different people that this would be fixed and I would be contacted but so far nothing. I phoned today to chase to be told that they needed to submit the fault again. This was obviously ignored the first time. I will be phoning every day until this is resolved. Hurry up Virgin Media in my area!
Robert Alexander,Albans House,3/28/16,"I have recently found that my broadband speed was 0.5 Meg per sec. I made an effort to improve this by contacting BT. They informed me that I could get 9-15 MBPS. I then went through the process of upgrading and was told that this would be completed by 18.03.16. I called BT on 28.03.16 to find out where my new hub was and that I hadn't seen any improvement with my broadband speed. I was then told that I couldn't get anything better than 8MBPS. They also informed me that there was no evidence of the order being place.
I have wasted several hours of my time attempting to sort this out when it should have been quite an easy process. Also, why was I sold a package that can't be delivered?"
Mark,Northern Ireland,3/27/16,"Despite hearing all the horror stories of BT's terrible service I made the mistake of leaving sky for BT in the hope of getting better broadband speed. I ordered my package (BTinfinity and full tv bundle). Basically I seen a deal for BT package with 80mb infinity broadband. So I typed in my address and it said I could get infinity. So I went ahead and placed my order for 1 months time because I had to give sky 30 days cancellation notice. I had booked the BT to be installed on Monday 21st March, a week before this date the engineer would be calling out to the cabinet to hook me up to infinity. So before my engineer called out I just decided to log into myBT so see order progress if any and it said ""your order will be complete on Thursday 24th March"". So I contacted them and they said it had been changed to 24th, nice of them to not email and let me know this. I was also not even able to track the progress because it just keeps saying an error occurred. So anyway my sky ended and because BT were going to be 3 days later than I booked I was going to be without any phone/internet or tv service for 3 days. Then on Thursday 24th the phoneline came back online but no internet. I contacted them and after numerous times on hold and being blatantly hung up on I was told that the internet order had been canceled due to ""a mismatch in reference ID"", which apparently means the cabinet the engineer called out to has the old copper connector which can't be used for infinity, the girl said I might not be able to get infinity and they would update me on Tuesday 29th March (my semidetached next door neighbor has infinity and used the same cabinet so seems odd). Keep in mind the only reason I switched from sky was because I was told I could get infinity, which in my mind is basically false advertising. So I am without internet for over a week so far and not knowing what service I will eventually end up paying for."
kittykat,Ilford,3/27/16,"Worst service ever. Never had issues with sky. Router is rubbish - you cannot pick up a signal after a few metres, cannot use another router withit, tied to rubbish bt dns that keeps failing and technical support blame it on router or your computer, when it is obvious it is the bt dns that has gone down and then after lengthy phone call and escalation they finally admit the issue is at there end. Speed is on par with dial up on a bt infinity 1 contract with no fibre running into home... so no fibre only copper! MISSOLD! Then you call to log faults and they lie that it has been raised when it actually has not. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! ANYONE THINKING OF MOVING TO BT - DON'T - YOU WILL REGRET IT! THEY LIE AND CHEAT CUSTOMERS!"
Mary,King's Lynn,3/26/16,"We placed an order several weeks ago for broadband. 2 days after we moved into our new house, still no broadband so we called BT. They told us to wait a few more days, then they would call us. No call after a few days - they'd tricked us into waiting longer so our '14 day opt out period' had expired. We now cannot leave as we are 'contractually bound' to use BT now. Still no broadband, 2 weeks later. We're still paying for the service. Unable to cancel. We've been disconnected from the online chat by them as soon as we mention we have a complaint! We've been promised a phone call in 4 days - as if that's going to happen! We still haven't been told what the problem is. I've never had such bad service in my life as with BT."
Andrews,London,3/25/16,I have been with BT now for two years first year was good broad band speeds brill then renewed my contract and that is where the problems started speeds keep dropping can not keep the speeds I have even emailed bt openreach executive and they are not helpful at all went to the ombudsman and they fell on BT side even my MP was a waste of space have sort legal advice and told cant do much but start a twitter campaign might get BT openreach to do something
Hughes,North Wales,3/25/16,"I changed providers from Talk Talk to BT Infinity 2. BIG MISTAKE.

Their claims of up to 76mb is utter rubbishy and was not even able to get half of that. It's all a scam.

They blame it on old cables or aluminium cables from the cabinet but won't invest in upgrading this infrastructure.

So basically, it's lump it or like it.

Don't waste your time with BT. Come back TALK TALK, all is forgiven.

Wish Virgin were in my area."
Abbel,Sheffield,3/24/16,"Disappointed is not right word for this, as a new customer I have been given 3 different activation dates to now and still theres a technical fault with my order they. I regret to have left my old provider and now stuck in this...un believable"
Karl,Durham,3/23/16,Fed up with speed playing up!
Rikitita,,3/23/16,"BT has the worst service I ever had in my life! As a freelance IT consultant I live by internet. 7 calls with no information provided, misleading messages on the site and sms (not even talking about direct chat) and a lot of frustration. They were not even able to give me a date when service will be provided! Disgusted by the service! Monkeys would do a better job!"
Andrew,York,3/22/16,"fast broadband when working, connection drops out on average 10 times per day usually at most inconvenient times. You can always contact customer service of course if you have a spare hour or so and they will do everything within their power to NOT solve your issues, tell you there could be an extra charge and try sell you other products that you neither want nor need. In my area they are the only provider of superfast broadband meaning for now I haven't much choice but to stick with them but as soon as ANY other company can provide internet I will be changing. I would strongly recommend anyone else over BT."
Mr G Carr,Southampton,3/22/16,"Very poor due to line fault. Repeated connection failures.

BT show little interest and will not check line without me agreeing to pay 'when' fault is found in my equipment. Review of line indicated to be in about a week maybe.."
D,Yorkshire,3/22/16,
James Martin,"Chelsea, London",3/22/16,"Allow me to explain my rating...

Unfortunately the minimum is 1 star. The reason this is unfortunate is because I cannot tell you what the speed or reliability is like. After 8 months, I still do not have BT internet.

My flatmate and I have spent an astonishing amount of time on the phone in order to reconcile some sort of service (any will do at this point) from one of the most poorly run organisations I have come across. We have both lived and worked globally and this is the worst company I have dealt with. It is an organisation which is about as reliable as Tony Blair's promises.

Back in July 2015, we purchased BT internet on a bundle with BT sport. We waited a month or so to be connected but got nowhere. BT could not connect our wifi and they said they would send an engineer out. They then texted to say ""apologies, this our mistake, we will cancel the engineer"". They did not cancel the engineer. Instead, they charged us £130 for the engineer.

We used to have BT Sport. They stopped our subscription around Christmas because we haven't paid our wifi bill. We have had no wifi.

After about 28 phone calls, with an average wait time of 50 minutes each time, they actioned a formal complaint on our behalf. they said they would call us back. Guess what..?

I urge anyone, in fact no, I beg EVERYONE to not purchase BT wifi. You will be making a grave error. If you choose to ignore this advice, then best of luck. You'll need it."
F B King,Glossop,3/22/16,"Tend to get knocked off-line once or twice a week though it does re-connect very quickly.
Checked speed today - 37.51Mb - this is supposed to be infinity fibre optic!"
Roy,WORCESTER,3/21/16,"I placed an order as a new customer with BT for TV, Broadband and Telephone services back in February all I can say is that I'm not yet a customer and I've already experienced what can only be described as complete and utter incompetence from BT.

I phoned today to enquire as to why I had not received any communication with regards to my order, only to be told that there was a problem with my existing phone line which was being seized by my current provider. This meant an engineer that was due to call on at the end of the month wouldn't now call while my services with my current provider are due to cease next week. And yet no-one from BT contacted me to advise of this. I was then tersely told by the BT advisor to contact my current provider to inform them that I won't be moving to BT so ensure my line will be released. And yet I already informed my current provider over a month ago that I was ceasing with their services, would be having my direct debit cancelled after the 28th and have also had my last payment with them adjust accordingly to reflect the termination of my contract with them. And yet BT are asking me to contact them to restore my line because of BT's incompetence.

And worse is that I had a conversation with BT 2 weeks ago to inform them that my current provider wouldn't release the line (which meant I couldn't keep my telephone number) but I was told by the rather cocky advisor that everything would be fine (inc being issued with a new number) and that my order would go through and that my BT services would commence at the end of this month. It was also during this conversation that I was informed that my previous order with BT, placed online, would be cancelled and replaced by a new order which result in further savings for me compared to my previous online order.

So, I'm not even a customer and I'm already experiencing problems with BT which doesn't bode well for the future. I should have heeded the warnings from some of my friends who said BT were a nightmare to deal with.

All I can say is DO NOT move to BT. They are frankly useless!"
Clare Connor,Dorset,3/21/16,"Similar to other reviews - after waiting 3 weeks for a date they gave us, the engineer visit was cancelled without warning and it was impossible to get through to anyone who knew what was going on. The order call centre is in India and staff had trouble understanding English let alone why our order had been cancelled. After speaking to about 6 different people and a week later we found out that an Engineer would not need to visit after all (although the 5 people prior said they did, which would have meant another wasted day off work) when the broadband was set up but would need to go to the local exchange, however BT were stating that Open Reach kept cancelling the order every time they tried to re-place the order. We still don't have broadband but apparently they are still trying... I would avoid BT broadband at all costs as have never had this trouble with any other providers. It is clear that their systems do not work and their staff training would appear to be terrible with people not understanding the basics of how their service works. If anyone from BT reads this, your live chat is also awful. It can say that you have 8 minutes waiting time until the next agent but it regularly reaches the end of the countdown but still spends ages searching for an agent. At this point you are without a countdown or idea if someone will respond, or you have dropped off the waiting list."
Dean Pearcy,Doncaster,3/21/16,"This company should not be trading. They are arrogant, rude, threatening and just supply a poor shoddy service. I am paying over £30 monthly for a standard broadband connection of 1meg, this is discounted and should be nearer £40. New BT fibre, which has just arrived here is £10+phone so I asked to change. Nope, you can't have NEW, so please pay us £25 +phone!!! Not a chance, so moving elsewhere. Since I notified them of this, I have been called or emailed every day. Threatening letter covering extra charges for loads of things that MIGHT happen. I will NEVER go to BT again. Look after your existing customers BT, it will reap dividends in the end."
Jen,Lancing,3/19/16,"The most horrendous service! I've had 3 BT hubs over 18 months and my internet cut out dozens of times during the day. No one at BT seems to speak English and they get very annoyed when you ask them to repeat themselves as you couldn't understand them. I was told to perform repair checks myself and was given an automated helpline number which apparently talks you through the process of fixing it. It goes on about wires, circuits, cables etc, which I know nothing about. I have dyspraxia and I'm not good with anything practical at the best of times. When I rang BT again, they told me to get my screwdriver and unscrew the phone socket box. When I told the guy I didn't own a screwdriver as I can't use one, he got very annoyed and told me to out and buy one. He kept ringing me every day for several days but I couldn't answer my phone as I was at work, like most people between 9-5. When he finally got hold of me, again, he was very rude and told me he had been trying me all day. I told him I was at work and he had the cheek to tell me that he tried my mobile but I didn't bother answer that either. Again, I told him I can't take personal calls at work. He was very hostile and rude. Nothing got done and I've now changed to Virgin. I'd rather never have wifi again than go to BT. Awful company! Don't even deserve 1 star!"
Veronica,Leominster,3/18/16,Appauling isp. Our download speed was deliberately reduced in May 2015 from 0.9mb to 0.3mb and now we only have an infrequent connection. BT and their pals Openreach and the Ombudsman are all in cahoots and blame each other. So much for the governments promise of highspeed broadband for all - feel as if we live in a third world country.
alana hills,Worthing,3/16/16,"Absolute joke of a company.

Engineer was supposed to come between 8-1. Got to 1.30 so I called BT and they said the engineer booking failed. Had no explanation, no apology. I had no call or email to let me know of this change.

Not one person I spoke to was English, I couldn't understand a word they were saying. In total was on the one for 2 hours! JOKE never join BT"
Dan,Swadlincote,3/15/16,"Had an issue with my fibre optic internet as speed that were initially excellent dropped to a level that were somewhere between dial up and slow broadband (closer to dial up). Suspecting a problem with the crap BT homehub 3 I phoned BT and was actually told ""that's just the way it is"" basically ""live with it"". I changed the wireless router for an ASUS model and presto the hi speed fibre optic internet was back. Now the whole inifinity network has gone down where I live and yet when you do the on line service test it shows ""no problems in your area"" - which kind of contradicts the ""service status"" page on the website that shows that there is. 2 days and no internet - all they do is push it back another 4 hours every time they miss a deadline. Omni shambles."
Carl Roberts,Ashington,3/14/16,BT was good for the first year however they have decreased my broadband speed and it is now 10x less than it should be. I do not recommend this broadband.
Adrian,London,3/14/16,
Andy69,Nottingham (Zurich),3/14/16,"From the outset: I have *no* commercial connection with BT, and - as I live abroad - am not even a BT customer myself, but merely administer my ageing mother's UK account on her behalf. Reading the litany of dissatisfaction in the comments posted here, I really wonder if we are talking about the same company. Having extricated my mother from the clutches of TalkTalk some years ago (now *there's* a company to steer clear of, if ever there was one), I switched her to BT and have been more than happy ever since. Sure, there are some niggles (like the so-called ""International Freedom"" chargeable add-on which is actually capped at 600 minutes per month and so should be re-named accordingly), but by and large we have no cause for complaint. The phone lets us make and receive calls when we need to; the broadband (which I use when I'm staying with her) is fast, reliable and reasonably priced, with no usage limit; and the bills add up as they should. When we need to contact support staff, e.g. to renew or modify my mother's contract, we find them helpful and efficient. Which, incidentally, is more than I can say for many a vastly more expensive media / telecoms company over here in Switzerland. So why not give BT a break, folks?"
Zee,London,3/13/16,
Jag,Harrow,3/13/16,I have requested BT to have a look at he issues I face whilst using the broadband. First time they did the line test and asked to open up the socket and check they concluded there was some issues with the line coming into the property external work done on the pavement had buried the junction box and when it rained the connections got crossed. It has now been six months and I still get intermittent connection. Bt have not been helpful and requested payment of £100 to look into this reoccurring problem. I pay all my bills but am not getting the high service I was promised in the original contract. I have also sent them details via their website when connection is there. Please fix this
Gareth Puhj,Warrington,3/12/16,"Do not buy any BT services. After being with Sky for years we decided to change to BT for the BT Infinity service. Took 1month and 2 engineers (one of which disappeared during the job without saying and without solving it) to connect. After that we were put on a completely different package where we accrued data usage fees. Promised to remburse us but never happened. Trying to sort out the problem was a nightmare. So many phone calls without resolution. There followed dozens of phone calls, where we were cut off often and we were back to square one. 6months down the line, still getting charged for a service that we were missold. Cancelled and gone back to Sky, should never have left. Appealing customer service and rip off merchants."
Ann,North Wiltshire,3/12/16,Best advice. DON'T even consider using BT. Words fail me to even attempt summing up the complete lack of Customer Service and product service. The only department that seems to function is the Accounts. They have a brilliant ability to rob their Customers
Adam,Greenford,3/9/16,"Really bad experience... Speed very slow, CS is annoying - had to cal them 5 time in the last 3 weeks, average waiting time is 25 minutes!!!! Switching away from them. Upset and disappointed."
Z mclean,Newtownhamilton,3/8/16,"Poor speed
Unreliable
And customer service is frustrating when calling up"
jodi,tonyoandy,3/8/16,
david bird,herefordshire,3/7/16,
simon,wiltshire,3/5/16,"The biggest mistake I have made is signing up to BT. The company are a joke and it's an embarrassment that they are a British company.
First there was a problem with my order which I thought they had quickly sorted.
Then my services were not installed when they said they would and after countless missed dates was eventually up and running 5 weeks later.
Once my broadband was up and running I realised my BT TV service was not working and called only to find that had been wiped from my order so had to phone to get that sorted.
Once this was sorted the next day my TV package was not the one that I ordered (channels not activated).
Once this was sorted I phoned to check that my billing would be as per my order and not at the current prices as they had risen. Was told my billing would be at current price and not as per my order with the offers at the time (2 months prior). I was told this would be corrected and prices would be as per my order.
Every bill since has been wrong and was told I would be reimbursed on my next bill only for that to be wrong.....and so on and so on.
I have not received my £100 voucher as promised and have chased this up being told it would arrive within 30 days and then 10 working days....... still not arrived.
My broadband stopped working and was told this would be fixed within 3 days and 5 days later it is still not working and had no update or info from BT. Can't use broadband,BT TV, Netflix, now TV, playstation plus. So I'm paying for all these services I can't use.
BT are shocking and I have phoned to cancel my contract only to be told I have to pay £206 (remainder of contract). Next step is the ombudsmen for me to get out of this sham of a company.
WARNING......stay away from BT at all costs,they will make you pull your hair out and customer service is non existant and no help. In 4 months I have spent around 10 hours on the phone to BT to sort out the issues I have had. I had be with sky for 8 years and plus net 8 years before BT and never had a problem. I can't wait to get out of this BT hell and will be more than happy to pay the extra £10 a month and get back to sky."
Smith,Stroud,3/5/16,"BT is literally the worst broadband company in the world, I would even give it 1 star for all categories. We've been having gigantic problems with our broadband for the past 2 months. We've tried to contact BT multiple times for help and solutions, but all we get is some person telling us they are going to ""monitor"" our connection for a few weeks. I don't want that, I want a reliable internet service that can give me more than 0.25mbps 90% of the time. I do not recommend BT to anyone who is buying broadband. Worst. Company. Ever."
Ana,Southampton,3/4/16,"Poor service, no respect for customer! When we changed to BT we explained that the line and broadband would b used for business and we need a guarantee of a reliable service. Today Ive been told that who ever set us up didn't put us on a business plan and that now we have to wait until Monday for a phone call (which I was promise to recurve today as the fault was reported yesterday) to let us know when problem will b sorted.

So if you are thinking of changing or getting BT (BT infinity) don't bother! Go with SKY."
Michal,Daventry,3/3/16,I'm disappointed at the customer service BT provides. It is a joke to wait almost a month to switch the broadband from one place to another. I believe that governess of BT don't know that the customer satisfaction is the most important in the business. I will never ever sign next agreement with this pathetic provider.
Alistair Murray,Thurso,3/3/16,"Amongst others in our estate we are 200 yds from superfast broadband, yet cannot access it, and our own BT 'speed' averages 1/8 of what is promised and 1/3 of other providers. Service here is only marked a '2' as people on the phone are polite, but they reside in another country, have no accountability and basically the whole set up is a disgrace, as well as a joke given that our town is advertised as a shining exemplar. The truth is the service is highly patchy and I obviously reside in barren ground, so much so that my BT download was so slow last week that I had to get someone to physically post me a file on a disc. Welcome to the 21st century!!"
mimi,edinburgh,3/2/16,"i have to type twice this review bacon BT wifi sucks! We have to wait for a MONTH to get a modem. A MONTH! everytime when we called the customer service,we have to wait for 30min-1hr to get through the operator, to find out that our home address is wrong. even when we changed the address, the MODEM never came. we have to call the customer service for 10x and wait for a month before FINALLY getting our modem. we use BThub5 infinity, but the line is always disconnected, and sometimes it is so slow. WELL DONE BT!"
DD,Orkney,3/2/16,"They should be taken to court and sued. Any time they can their customer service team are rude and arrogant, don't listen and actually lie about other service providers to scare you into staying with them. I would actually go without broadband and telephone just to stop giving them any more money. They are obviously sticking to a script and have been trained in sales techniques in the guise of customer service! The same techniques were used to sell ppi and I guess the experts have now moved on to train but customer services!"
John Sakars,Lincolnshire,3/2/16,"Generally unreliable with awful speeds and prices, but the worst part is the Customer Service. You're frankly better off fixing any faults yourself."
natalie,EDGWARE,3/2/16,"Very unhappy! Don't advise anyone to have a contract with BT! Will just get you frustrated, they are absolutely 100% not delivering on their promises!!! Shame on BT! What a thieves!"
Marshal,Chesterfield,3/1/16,"Well, this is mostly about customer service I guess. I'm currently over an hour into my wait for an answer on the helpline and the web chat system kept me waiting for 40 mins before just disconnecting. I don't expect other suppliers are much better."
Anthony Siveter,Lound,3/1/16,"Totally pathetic, unable to watch tv because of constant buffering. Frequent breaks in broadband supply. Unable to upload photo's to, for e.g. eBay. Overall service is dreadful"

David,LISBURN,2/29/16,"We bought a new house and bt messed us about something serious. BT sent texts telling us to be ready for the engineer. I took a day off work they didn't turn up. Text again read new appointment. My wife took day off they never came, no excuse. After being connected for two weeks my broadband has died. They refused to send engineer so I've now cancelled my payments to them so they will have to contact me. It saves me waiting for hours waiting to speak to some illiterate gimp speaking pigeon English.
Do not use bt they are an embarrassment."
Abbi,Warwickshire,2/29/16,"Worst company ever!! Had broadband and landline problems for over 11 months. My broadband drops out over 100x a day! Also when the broadband cuts off so does my landline. Every time I ring to get the issue resolved the "" tech "" department runs a ""test "" tells me I'm a liar and there is nothing wrong with it then puts the phone down on me... the only time you get to speak to someone in the same country as you is if you ring to cancel ironically... i have had numerous engineers out for nothing to be fixed and still paying FULL PRICE. One of the engineers had crossed over my landline so someone with plus net had my number and I had nothing.. still being charged for the phone calls they made!! I've made complaint after complaint. Somehow ended up with bt sports package I asked to cancel that. Never got done I was made out to be a liar over asking to cancel that too. Avoid at all costs. I'd rate 0 stars if I could the company is a disgrace"
Jayde,Norwich,2/29/16,Well good to see its not just me. I am so annoyed at the customer service. Was on the phone for over an hour building up my phone bill to just get an answer of. Can't help you. It's such a discrace. They are of no interest of helping you they just want any excuse to take money off you for service your not getting. Moved house and took 2 weeks to get my service back and still had to pay for the service I wasn't getting plus extra. I will never be going to thus company again. I would be happy to pay more to a company that cares about their customers and receive good service ect. They don't even deserve a penny in my eyes.
Kevin McCarthy,Bexley,2/29/16,"BT has recently plumbed the depths of incompetence with regard to technical support and customer focus.
I have put up with years of needing to re-boot my hub upto 3 times a day and facing hours on the phone to an Indian call centre. A new hub was offered along with a statement that the fee would be waived even though I was not under an annual contract, I stated that I had had enough of their service, a hub 3 turned up anyway and despite returning it BT billed me anyway, since they work entirely on PoP and not serial numbers and did not accepted that I had been told that the fee would be waived.
A BT employee rang to put matters right and I agreed to rejoin - a hub 4 duly arrived and the service was actually quite reliable.
An associate BT company then took over my service without any notification - it took India 2 hours to work out why my BT service had suddenly failed. The associate company stated that even though I did NOT even have a contract with them they would not do anything about the takeover and I should contact BT Wholesale - I gave BT Retail another go due to the reliability of the new hub 4.
After a period customer support then recommended that if I cancelled my very latest BT contract then I could go for fibre in a couple of days - he would ring me back then - no ring back - the guy had obviously realised that there is no fibre for my street for NINE months.
Tried again - standard broadband can actually be put back in place within a week! SMS - sorry there's been a delay - please wait another 9 days. 3 more calls to customer support (including 1 obnoxious guy in an Indian call centre who kept stating that it was entirely down to BT Wholesale and he could not even chase it). Fortunately another customer service's rep did chase it and an expedited service request went through and was accepted - unfortunately this only led to a 1-2 day improvement.
Still thus waiting for re-instatement - something tells me that I should have just put up with re-booting my 'hub 2' multiple times a day!!
If you were thinking of joining BT please take my advice and use another provider - ANY OTHER PROVIDER - at least if you do not want to spend hours on the phone to customer services (largely really nice, if not always competent people) and technical support (they like to follow their scripts no matter what)!!!"
Ant,Leicester,2/29/16,"I did time with talktalk and that's what it's like ,poor service ok when you pay £19 a month that went up slowly to £35 started getting scam calls talktalk not interested.switched to bt cost bit more but get sport fast internet catchup flawless change over no problems."
Catherine,London,2/29/16,
Roy Fox,Essex,2/29/16,Don't touch BT. They have admitted to me on the phone their BT Hub has problems with Apple products. They simply hide behind the ombudsman and are not interested in getting to the bottom of the problem. I have lost a lot of money due to BT.
amir,harrow,2/28/16,"BT is the rubbish company running in Endlang, not organised, liars, they are ripping me off. Cancelling my line without my permission and information and cut my £604.00 from my account. They cancel my line because some stupid and idiot company called them and they happily agree without informing me,I will complain this matter to ofcom and I'll make sure I'll take them to court and will get my compensation for that.
My advice to everyone dont ever go with BT"
Sohaib,Glasgow,2/28/16,"Tried to place an order over 6 times over a period of 4 months. Kept waiting for things to activate. Each time, after waiting 1-2 weeks after the activation date, I would ring them asking them why it was not activated. I was told it was a 'technical issue' and they kept blaming my current provider of having 'tags on the line'. Why did they not bother to follow up with me after problems had arisen?

Eventually, got sick of it and I moved over to Sky who managed to change my telephone and broadband over in one smooth transaction.

BT are an absolute joke."
Ian Anderson,Ayrshire,2/27/16,"Paradoxically, I was glad to see so many reviews rubbishing BT, I thought it was just me!
I won't go in to the probs I'm having with them, suffice it to say, I'm the same as everyone else!
Why on Earth don't BT read these review pages!
It all seems so simple.
1. Man the help lines with people who are fluent in good English.
2. Provide the service its customers are paying for.
3. Admit it is in the wrong where appropriate and refund customers they have failed.
4. Acknowledge receipt of feedback where due.

All customers who are dissatisfied with them should avoid all the balleywho of using help and feedback etc. and should start bringing the matters to Gavin Patterson (CEO) personally by snail mail letter if nec..
Maybe if we started leaving in decent numbers and refused to pay severance fees (I don't understand why these can be due if they haven't provided the promised service) making them proceed thro' court cases by the hundred/thousand, they would start paying attention!
By the way, looking thro' the alternatives on various review sites, I am at a loss to see who is the best provider, everyone of them appears to be rubbish - any ideas?"
David Conyers,Shropshire,2/26/16,The village was connected very recently and posters trumpet the fact. Why? The speed is slow at best and connection is non-existant for several hours a day.
Dominik,,2/26/16,Bt is a bunch of layers. After I order my broadband 4 months ago I'm still Mieczysław Ciomek for vouchers. Broadband never is up to speed which I paid for.
Gray,London,2/25/16,"Nothing like what they sell you. This service is not fit for purpose. Customer service may be very good, if you can understand the people at the call centre. The staff often put the phone down on you because you have to keep asking them to repeat themselves to try and work out how to sort out the numerous defects with the equipment. If you are thinking of changing, don't bother Virgin is far, far better. BT is an acronym for Bl**dy Terrible"
Henry Bexley,Bexleyheath,2/25/16,"Extremely disappointing broadband speed: very unreliable and definitely under par of what I am supposed to get (up to 76Mb, according to BT)."
Charlotte,Bolton,2/24/16,I subscribed to BT Infinity 1 on Sunday and already I have received absolute diabolical service - I am absolutely astounded they get any business at all - I am going to cancel my order... and why cant I write on their facebook probably because they want to hide that fact they don't know the first thing about customer service!!! Anyone thinking of swapping over I would strongly suggest they think twice and then again because you haven't received diabolical customer service until you have to deal with this lot!!!
RAVI,LONDON,2/22/16,"BT Possibly the worst company I have dealt with for receiving broadband and tv.
Placed order in January now end of February still no broadband or tv.
They are cheaper for a reason.
""Very poor customer service/care ""
Overall Experience
Please remember that their tv runs of the broadband so if your broadband is slow you will get buffering also no broadband no paid for tv channels will work. Engage with them at your peril i'd rather pay more for to get consistency of service
quality of product
and good quality customer care.
Going back to my previous provider *** 15 years of uninterrupted service take my hat off."
BRIAN,WATTON,2/21/16,"Despite being informed by BT that we should be getting speeds up to at least 20mb/s, we are lucky to get 6 for downloads and 2 for uploads. No one seems that bothered when questioned about it but they still insist on charging for a service that isn't fit for purpose"
Mark,South West,2/21/16,"Ordered broadband about 5 times and 5 times they have messed up the order saying ‘it's a technical issue’.
Sales department misled so much about product, you can’t help be disappointed with results.
Was promised 35MB download speed, router only connected at 20MB with a through put of 14MB.
Home Hub 5 was noisy when in use; sounded like something was fizzing inside, was concerned about it catching fire. BT sent me a new one but this one was exactly the same. Router was always rebooting.
Overly all experience: expensive company that is overly aggressive and fails to deliver.
This service was costing me £32pcm + line rental. It included all telephone calls but BT always found a way to charge me for additional calls.
Change to EE; a hassle free experience; speed is now 31MB (EE only promised 22MB – nice to see a Company offer realistic speeds and then beating them, rather than lie on what can be achieved). Cost is £15pcm + line rental. Includes all telephone calls; including calls to mobile and international calls. Zero noise from router."
Linda monk,Basildon,2/20/16,"I went to bt on a promise of better broad band and better service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, I was cohersed by very convincing sales pater to believing I was going to receive a better service!!!!!!!!!!!, what a load of rubbish, all I can say is don't go with bt. It's the worst broadband provider I have ever had. BT YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE"
Nina,"London, w8",2/20/16,"The first revue in my life. The worth service I ever met in my life. Hours and hours on a phone to connect bt. Nobody know anything in this company and even manager can't give an explanation. The comain department didn't apologise. I was siting and crying in ""coffee concerto"" after 3 hours useless conversation with bt and the staff told me: don't worry we have the same, all the time with this provider. Nightmare."
Lee,Wisbech,2/19/16,
Kristof,Littlehampton,2/18/16,"They advertise they have the best hub, well actually the worst I think. My wifi keeps playing up. I should be getting 38Gb/s. Sometimes the speed drops down to 1-5 Gb/s. They did try to fix it over the phone. Still the same. Unexpected speed drops. Total disaster. Expensive mistake. Going back to sky shortly."
martin,birmingham,2/17/16,"they are so bad ,but we have no choice but to use them,if possible stay well clear"
Stuart B,Woking,2/17/16,"I've been with BT for 23 years for phone and took out BT broadband in 2013 when it came with ""free"" BT Sport. Last year they started charging me £5 a month for this ""free' service. I tried to cancel it on their website only to go round in many loops and circles before finding out that its not possible and you have to call them - shoddy tactics.

I called to cancel it. Was told I'd have to pay next month's charge anyway as it's 30 days notice. Waited 15 minutes on hold to speak with a supervisor only to be told that they'd call me back. They did - would not budge (I later found out t that Ofcom had told BT to refund customers who asked for this which they had been doing).

He got a sales person to call me to give me a better deal to make up for it. I was offered £10.85 instead of £18 for broadband. I said no on the basis that they are offering the same to new customers for £5 pm. Pretty insulting offer really and they clearly don't care about customer retention."
Graeme Winfield,Norwich,2/16/16,"I have just switched to BT from Plusnet. Its probably the worst thing I have ever done.
1. They messed up the order and I have had 1Mb instead of 7Mb for over a week (and counting)since I switched. They basically ordered a Bussiness 1000 line which is capped to 1Mb.
2. I took the whole package but they didnt make it clear when ordering that unless you have 10Mb you dont get the free BT sports.
4. The service desk is a joke. They appear to continually want to test your line and then relate what you already know. My belief is they just read from a script.

If you are considering BT my advice would be dont."
Saini,West London,2/15/16,"Worst ever mistake joining
Broadband still not working
Had taken nearly four weeks to install
Still a fault with the apparently third party
Wait 10 minutes to speak to help on the chat
Then 1 hour on the phone being passed around to
Order team, tech team then back to order management
Still no resolution! Apparently the broadband team also have us on the end of their start list. Why??
They say it wont start until another week and half!!!
How do BT keep their customers with such bad service
I regret joining BT and paying a upfront fee
Still waiting for a call back one hour and a half later"
Ray,South Yorkshire,2/15/16,"I joined BT on the 7th December 2015 and was very happy until 6th January 2016 when my phone line and wifi went off, After lots of calls from me to bt and promises the service would be working the next day after 5 days the phone line was fixed but we still have no wifi 2 months on. We keep getting told it will be next week and when that week and date comes we then get told yet again next week. I give up with them. What a waste of time."
S Nicholl,London,2/14/16,"Horrific company to deal with.

Avoid BT. I was with Onetel for years and they were actually better. Sadly for me I am locked into this contract for now but will end it as soon as I can. My broadband which is unlimited (supposedly) is functional less than half the time and very slow- I live in central London. All my attempts to resolve it are met with a non response. I even have a reference number for the complaint but they don't ever call me back. I have had three scheduled ring backs that never happened. They even lied and said they couldn't get through when I gave two numbers and kept both lines open. They take plenty of money from me and say customer service is a priority- well no wonder my broadband stinks since its even less important to them than the appalling customer service they don't provide. I am unable to use my smart TV for Netflix etc ok not the end of the world but not great when I am paying for it, and my student son is unable to use Moodle or upload essays by deadline- thanks BT!"
Abhi Chopra,Winnersh,2/13/16,"Extremely poor BT Infinity 2 broadband speed compare to Virgin, customer support is appalling, impersonal support agent, wait time to speak to support team is crazy 60 - 90 minutes! waisted money, effort... absolutely hate them !!!AVOID!!!"
PR,"Marylebone, London",2/13/16,"Perhaps if BT were paid consistent with the manner with which they provide broadband service - intermittently, slowly, and without recourse - they would take service more seriously. BT broadband is an embarrassing 3rd world service in one of the world's most advanced and delightful cities. A national shame!"
Anton,London,2/12/16,"Very bad Packet Loss from BT. Would not recomment at all, try other ISPs always before BT. You will won't regret it."
julie,hammersmith,2/12/16,the worst service ever. They are misleading. The broadband is crap the service is terrible. And quit frankly I cant wait for my contract to end.
Colin Lancaster,Northwich,2/12/16,"Moved from sky in Sept last year to BT and have lost days since trying to get the bband workink correctly.
DO NOT SWITCH TO BT I have had poor speed and constant connection issues which has meant my son has not really been able to use his xbox online, currently trying to cancel but they want in excess of £500- to move to another supplier"
Aqsa,Scotland,2/10/16,
Morgana,Middlesex,2/10/16,"Customer service: HORRIBLE! Chasing a refund and they tradferred me two times, the second time the person asked how she could help and she then put me on hold without even saying anything.
After 5 mins on hold the lone got cut and I couldn't even speak to them!"
Tula,Truro,2/9/16,"I made the foolish mistake of switching to BT from my broadband and phone line supplier over 12 mths ago, from the beginning it was a catalogue of errors and hassle. It started with my phone not enabling us to phone out! after hours on an offshore call centre getting nowhere with someone who knew absolutely nothing about BT services & how they worked, and was quick frankly rude!! I gave up after 2 days. My partner eventually found the solution on a forum of disgruntled BT customers!! eventually after 3 mths BT resolved the issue! my broadband speed was pretty useless most of the time and stuck with the contract I pushed on until it was due to expire. I was then shocked to see a debit for over double go out of my bank account with no warning ! Yes right on expiry good old BT with no warning stuck me on a tariff that basically ripped me off for double the amount! no email, no paperwork warning me my contract was due for renewal! I have since switched and surprise surprise BT can now email and write asking me to stay and offering a different contract! i should really contest the last 2 debits taken but I do not have the heart or the courage to try and ring their god awful call centre in India! It is by far the worst I have ever encountered! my advice is stay clear of BT, poor service, no customer care and quick to charge and debit you when without any warning! glad to be rid of their rubbish broadband and phone package!! oh and don't try and complain on their BT homepage or forum! they never respond and ignore you!!"
john,milton keynes,2/9/16,"I ordered bt broadband and tv on the 25/11/2015, I had to call them to point out an error on the order, I then got sucked into the bt call centre run around, 2 days later I decided to cancel my order, well within my cooling off period, it is now the 9/2/2015, well over 2 months after my initial contact and bearing in mind that I never actually became a bt customer and I have just managed to shake them off, they have made final demands for money they was never owed, taken money from my account that they were never entitled to take, and don't even get me onto the off shore call centres, if you do mange to pull one of the robots off his or her script they can become quite aggressive. well I can now breath a sigh of relief and it`ll be an experience that I will, never repeat"
Ivo Macedo,London,2/8/16,"From a customer service point of view, BT is by far the worse provider I have ever experienced.

Took them 2 months to get my broadband + sports working after multiple engineer appointments and infinite time spent on the phone and online chat. Had I not been pro-active, I'm afraid I would still be awaiting for my service activation.

It has been a very frustrating experience. As soon as my contract ends I'll be moving out."
James,Tonbridge,2/8/16,"I've got to say the BT broadband/TV itself is really fast and reliable ever since it was connected. I'm using it for web surfing, cable TV and streaming. Down side is that their phone and online chat service is a mess. Overall 4 star I think it's fair."
Patricia Martin,,2/6/16,
Saj,Pontypool,2/6/16,"I am so happy to see so many negative reviews on BT. Based on my experience, they all seem to be true. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE. I will not take their service even if it is free. They charged more for what I've used, when called the response was cold and took a long time to sort out. When I decided to leave BT, a customer service representative called me who was absolutely rude and I felt like being interrogated.

Take my advice, never take any service from BT even if free."
Rhodri,Rhymney,2/6/16,"My broadband has been ok. However there was a problem when I wanted to add a new device to my broadband.

Partly my own fault as I lost my password... however trying to get a reset is absolutely impossible!

The Internet page is completely useless and you have to wait over 40 mins for an answer from 1 of the 4 people who work there and the automated services is a complete joke."
Matthew,Soberton,2/5/16,"Just a poor level or service delivery, I mean all the adverts boasting about the fastest internet etc..

My average download line speed is 1 mb i mean that's awful compared to the country average of around 17 mb.

Just not happy!!"
Chris,Surrey,2/5/16,"Bt what can I say? I went with them two years ago to get the TV as infinity had been instead and Virgin couldn't give us TV. The pallaver to get the broadband phone and TV installed an running was unbelievable with endless calls to BT and the so called technical centre in India [ who to be fair at the time did at least call back ] even though they couldn't fix the problem of a ""stuck"" order. The whole thing had to be cancelled at started over again and still there were delays and letters asking me to return equipment which didn't need to be returned. Eventually it was all sorted [ but it took around 4 weeks to get everything working properly anf=d hours frustration on the phone to polite but useless people who didn't or couldn't keep their promises or who couldn't understand the issues ] .Since then the broadband and TV service has been fine with speeds as promised of 38mb. Prices have however risen considerably over time .

Recently they wrote to me putting up the charges saying if I didn't take out another contract with them they were going to charge me around £7 more and would no longer get Sport lite [ which I don't watch anyway ] .I called BT ,after getting quotes from other suppliers and they kindly agreed to offer me the current service plus BT sport for considerably less than Talk Talk or Sky - I was happy again or so i thought . Then the problems began .

The BT sport duly arrived the next day and I called their sales team to ask if i could have the HD channel bolt on . You would have though this simple request but no . This was agreed and an order submitted told it would take probably a couple of hrs but at worst it would be 24 max.

No HD channelled 24 hrs later - nada. Called 150 [ long wait and user automated system with a Scottish lady telling me how important my call was and would i like to use their web site which proudly announced ""sorry for the delay"" and gave information none of which was relevant or did not solve the issue ] .On getting through to the Oders team or tech dept or who ever they were the saga with their Indian call centre began. 150 answered and after a further interminable wait to muzak was put through the ] I have called them 5 times and on each occasion i have been assured the service will start and on two occasions would be called back as they were personally monitoring my order . I have to say no such calls were ever received and I am still without the HD version of the channels [ at one pointI even lost the exisitng internet / non hd channels but miraculously they were restored 6 hours later ].
I have had to spend hours on the phone waiting and explaining to some very polite but disingenuous and ineffective staff who have basically fobbed e off with a load of old tripe and unfulfilled promises [ lies I suppose ]. Even one of the women at the call centre told me SHE had been cut off by the Orders Dept. Every time you must speak to a different person and they all parott the same script but despite promises they don't solve your problem - which in my case where is my order ?

In frustration I googled the BT's CEO e mail adress [ Gaivn Patterson ] and wrote to him . This at least resulted in a prompt reply although I suspect it was probably computer generated since it arrived about 9pm in the evening but was singed from ""Gavin"". All very mately I suppose he can afford to be but since Iv e never met him and he's not my friend Ifound this a rather superficial and dare I say it American overly familiar way to sign off to a customer and shareholder { why? I am seriously asking the question ]

....I have now been passed to the Executive Support Team [ whoever they are ] to claim to be taking ownership of the problem and not to contact any else in BT as they might get confused [ from my experience that would be a racing certainly] .The claim they will get back soon ... we will see.

I pointed out MR patterson that surveys by Which ? and others show BT a the t bottom of the league for customer service and that now I had experienced the reality of BT I was in full agreement.

I have also loolked at heir website on quality issues and they have all the mamagmetn speak and about stuff programmes to improve service , Quaky assurance , ISO9001 .[In my epxpereicne the assurance rating is useless since basically BT set the standard they want to meet - one it seems that is not very challenging - and then they get accredited because they can meet it!] .tere was aloud off giiif about customer care building ""shareholder value"" to persuade gullible persons to invest with what is basically the a privatised PO telephones service monopoly writ large and with a similar level of service to boot.

Whilst I have been happy wth the broadband which has lived up to expectations I cannot sy the same for their customer service, problem solving and their call centres which are the worst Ive ever experienced { although Vodafone on occasions have come a close second . ]

I would be loath to recommend BT to anyone they are simply too large .

[NB 17 years ago my PC got infected with an autodialler virus and BT allowed my quarterly phone bill to get to neatly £500 - it was normally about £40 - before someone contacted me . They had already paid the fraudsters in Vanuatu for frusdent calls I hadn't made and refused refund me anything. Ofcom were useless too, although I later discovered I could have sued BT to get the money back . I left them immediately and swore I'd never go back. I should have stuck with Virgin or gone to Sky . The only reason I went back to BT was because wanted improved TV and broadband and didn't want a sky dish on my house - however that would have been be a small price to pay given the problems I've had with thier call centres. Why do these companies think outsourcing to India or wherever will improve their service ? I suspect it is all about saving money of course and not as they claim building ""shareholder value"" I am sure there are plenty of location in England who would welcome BT establishing a call centre there. It is British telecom after all and not Asian Telecom.

Don't bother with BT if you have an alternative - if you have problem they are simply dreadful and their cal centre staff even lie to you [very politely ]but lie is still a lie , - anything to get you to hang up . Awful, and I have shares in this company must be mad ! [ They are soon to be sold ]."
Tim Averill,Notting hill,2/5/16,"absolutely appalling service! still not connected after 1 week of trying. Tried to call to sort out and was put in a queue for over 1 hr on the phone.
The worst service i have ever received and would not recommend using this at all"
Thomas Allan,Edinburgh,2/5/16,"I have bt sport, got a bill of 154.36 when I'm usually 10 pound a month, and when I phoned up they did say they had made a mistake and we're sorry, but I will have to wait 10 working days for a refund! They make a mistake and I'm the one that has to wait for my money that I need!!!"
Richard,Portsmouth,2/5/16,"Terrible customer service. If something goes wrong during your contract,it is an absolute nightmare to get BT to help fix it, even when its their fault!
I was left for 8 weeks without broadband & then they re-charged me all the activation costs on my next bill."
Dr L,UK,2/4/16,"NOTE: This review has been given one star only because no stars is not an option.
A series of problems since November 2015 relating to the date on which I pay my direct debit. These culminated in BT's complete failure to take ANY payment in January, 2016. The company sent me an email just after Christmas telling me they were going to put up my direct debit payment. They didn’t taken any payment in January so I was surprised to get another email telling me my new direct debit would be for less. The logic of this must be that if we don’t pay, BT won’t charge us.
I have spent what seems like half of my life trying, and failing, to resolve this matter by phone, email and online chat (BT's ""preferred"" option). Staff, both in the UK and in India, are rude, aggressive and not above lying if they think it necessary. There is no concept of customer service, and the technical aspects of BT's provision leave much to be desired: my broadband speed is well below the minimum advertised speed. As soon as my contract ends I will be ending my 32 year association with BT. The company must be doing extremely well if it can afford to alienate its long-standing customers. AVOID at all costs."
phil,Telford,2/4/16,"Iv been a customer for a number of years, overall it is working every day , videos sometimes lock up as speed is a little slow but thats about once a week on average, Cost is the part that annoys me, Lots of offers to new customers but no customer care for current customers i pay £18.70 pm"
Tanya,Perthshire,2/3/16,"The service that you receive from BT customer service is an absolute disgrace, late in returning calls, phone the wrong number rude and unhelpful the list could go on. I have waited in 5 times for an engineer to look at our broadband never an apology couldn't careless. And as for the slow and patchy broadband useless. Would never recommend BT to anyone."
Darcey,Worcester,2/3/16,It's the worst broadband ever I'm apauled by the services. They charged us twice on the 2nd month and tryed to pretend that it wasn't them also the internets is always going on and off u are lucky if u get signal.
Fed Up,London,2/2/16,
Peter,"Ahoghill, County Antrim, Northern Ireland",2/2/16,"At first quite good speeds and reliability though expensive. Then over the years the connections began to drop now and then. I never complained as I thought they're the best out here. Then today total failure. I completed their diagnostic tests countless times with no joy. Tried to phone their service status helpline about 7 times but only managed to get an automated message twice which informed me everything was grand where I lived despite the message being over 2 hours old. I was then told to phone their helpline however it was constantly engaged throughout the afternoon.

Finally after 3.5 hours when I had just managed to get an answer on their helpline the broadband worked with no explanation. Never actually spoke to an engineer just heard another automated message saying we are having problems and for me to leave my name and number for a customer survey!

I did then get a phone call back from BT on my number asking who I was! They then said oh we are having problems ourselves and so I cannot help you.

Brilliant. I just hung up. Useless company."
Robert,Tain,2/2/16,"Been with BT a day, engineer didn't turn up, broadband doesn't work, customer service continuely forward you to someone else, quite simply the worst company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with, avoid BT at all costs"
Meera,London,2/1/16,"A 1 star is not suitable.

Moved from bt to sky and wifi keeps dropping and I have to keep using my data mobile to access info, which works out to be more costly than converting to bt.

Customer service desk have been absolutely Unhelpful suggesting that an engineer can come but will cost me 120 pounds to check for a fault I never ever experienced with sky.

All advise from bt already stated in this message regarding bt support is consistent with how they are responding...take no blame to their service.

Shockingly I am supposed to provide dates and times when it drops. A ridiculous request, since a normal user is not even able to monitor dropping of wifi for few seconds.

I regret moving now and committing to a 12 mth contract"
dan,ARBROATH,1/31/16,i cant get through on phone as they just hang up. the speed is much lower than promised. any problems you have they dont want to fix without trying to charge £129.99. should never have went with bt!. cant give no stars or half stars 1 star is still to good for the service you recieve
Chris,Orkney,1/27/16,"Shocking customer service, BT have been scheduled to attend my property twice in the last week to install broadband and a landline. on both occasions they didn't turn up and the company made no attempt to let me know they wouldn't be attending. Go elsewhere for your broadband."
Swindled again,County Durham,1/27/16,"My tale is too terrible to tell in detail. 2 lines in 2 locations, swindled out of the Sainsburys voucher at one and problem after problem after problem with the other. Terrible supply (cut off for 2 weeks over Xmas and New Year), line keeps dropping, swindled by misinformation twice, misled over 'faster' broadband, hours and hours and hours and hours spent talking to people with an unintelligible accent. They are beyond belief."
Hall,North Yorkshire,1/26/16,"I have wasted too many hours of my life over the last six months fighting with BT, to leave a full detailed review. Just trust me and all the other many unhappy BT customers out there, that this company is best left well alone and I hope it will eventually die the horrible death it deserves! The customer service is the worst I have EVER experienced, the so called fibre optic broadband is slower that my old 'normal' broadband was, and most of the staff I spoke to were impossible to understand at best and mostly dishonest. Don't bother going to the Ombudsman about them either - they clearly work on behalf of BT and are as useless as a chocolate fire guard! Beware of PLUSNET as well; apparently they are part of BT, which explains why I had such bad service from them when I was with them a few years ago! You have been warned!!"
James,London,1/26/16,
Peter Taylor,Acton Burnell Shropshire,1/26/16,"So it has come to this, writing a review in order to vent my spleen or in the vague hope that a miracle might occur and someone leaps into action, I'm being too positive.

I moved home in April last year using the BT Home Move Service. Since the day I moved BT have continued to charge me for two accounts, one from the old home and one from here. To add to this they sneakily added BT Sport to BOTH accounts, absolutely without my consent, I never agreed to this..ever.

The effort I have put in every month since April last year to get them to stop illegally stealing money from me is beyond words, I would honestly punch the CEO repeatedly in the face if I was ever to see him.

Every month, hours of my time wasted on the phone to some other country, the promises that it is sorted I hear every time and NOTHING changes, the bills keep on coming.

If I could ask the police to go and arrest the boss of BT for stealing my money every month I would.

The customer service is outrageously poor in every respect, from understanding the problem to downright lies about how it will be sorted. How a company can get away with this time and time again is beyond me.

BT steals my money and when they are caught they won't pay it back, even when they say they will, not a penny received, not a problem sorted.

Unfortunately I don't have a choice here, the minute I do then BT can go hang. Makes me sad they are allowed to use the word BRITISH, they should change it to MAFIA Telecom."
Agne,London,1/25/16,"Ok, BT. The first product I bought with them was a BT Wi-Fi contract for a year. Half a day spent on the phone swearing and despairing, as their software could not process my credit check (no negative points, 1 credit card, previous credit-checked long terms contracts, etc.). Eventually, after much frothing at the mouth, my partner got to speak to someone sensible who set the service up.

Flash forward. A year later, setting up BT broadband. First the quoted engineer fee is charged even after I'm told there is no need for an engineer visit. Then the BT Hub doesn't arrive - at all. Then the new hub does arrive, but is missing a part without which it cannot be set up. Then I am patronized on the phone by being told 'it definitely was included, it is there' even after I have checked multiple times. After much foaming at the mouth, I am despatched replacement parts. Then the invoice comes, with a double delivery fee charged and the contract fee charged from the day when the Hub wasn't even delivered.

Boy, I don't think you could do worse, BT, I really don't."
alexandra,cardiff,1/25/16,"If you want to get ripped off or literally throw your money down the drain by all means join up with BT if however you don't like being conned or value your money STAY WELL AWAY!not once have i paid the amount that i signed up for half way through my contract they raised there prices without even notifying me which then on top overdrawn my bank as i didn't have enough funds to pay the bill then they charge an extra £3 a month when you do cancel your direct debit which they don't tell you about and to top it all off now when i have called up to cancel everything then call up again a month later surprise surprise no acknowledgement of me calling no record or call log?!very convenient on there behalf now to actually cancel not only have i got to pay my outstanding bill they have whacked another £30 charge on top for cancellation fee!!beyond flabbergasted and beyond disgusted and if you ever want to try and resolve anything on your account when you call there ""customer service""number you are on hold every time guaranteed for at least 20mins before you even speak to anyone.And seeming as BT is meant to stand for British Telecommunications every time you get through to there call centre only once have i ever spoken to anyone british and this is me calling them literally over 100 times all there call centres are mainly primarily located in india where alot of them can't understand you and can't even speak english properly!Incompetent employees Incompetent Business and absolute sham of a company they should genuinely be ashamed of themselves avoid like the plague!"
Crowley Macleod,Gloucestershire,1/25/16,"I have been a loyal customer to BT for 15 years and the customer service, braodband speed and outages are getting worse. The latest upset is where BT has charged me for calling an 0808 freephone number. Therefore, I am now in a battle with BT and the Ombudmsman and cannot wait to switch away from BT. They are too big of a company to give two hoots to their customers, unless of course you are a business customer, then they will bend over backwards for you...

If you have the option of moving with another provider take it (as long as BT do not own the line)..."
j. clarke,manchester,1/24/16,"problem after problem with bt phone line, broadband and tv since infinity contract began in june 2015. the helpline frustratingly regularly ditch calls. i estimate 30+ hours on the phone trying to sort things out, 3 days lost work with engineers that don't attend. never experienced such bad customer service. currently waiting for engineer since mid december 2015 for tv problems (again) and now landline went down 6 days ago. there's not been one day of this contract that's been problem free. bt themselves admitted the other day that they may not be able to provide the tv service and may withdraw it from the contract which i hope means i'll be able to leave the contract early."
franz,wokingham,1/22/16,"price different than promised, impossible to talk with customer service, engineer missed appointment to fix broadband fault. Horrible experience"
Astonished,"Wrightington, Wigan",1/22/16,
John Mills,Dumfries,1/20/16,I have just wasted another 30 mins trying to contact BT. My broadband while fairly reliable is appallingly slow. My download speed varies between 0.6 and 0.8 Mbps! I cannot access any streaming services. Although I understand my green box is enabled they won't offer me Infinity.
LB,Huddersfield,1/20/16,"Firstly I have never worked for BT, or in any company related to broadband etc., just used this service for phone & broadband since 2005.
I have never had a problem with phone, speed or router which is still the original one I got free in 2005 and set up myself at my previous property and after my house move! Customer service on the two occasions I've needed it (with PC, no probs at all since I moved back to Mac) has been excellent. Despite being abroad, the advisors were helpful, knew their stuff, sorted the issues & rang back later to check all was well. Phoning UK just before contract expiry has allowed me to negotiate a better price each time and whilst BT is not the cheapest, I would never change (unless something happens in the future to alter my opinion)."
David Roberts,Colwyn Bay,1/18/16,"Since BT changed their e-mail client,from Yahoo to the BT Mail version.i have been utterly frustrated and disappointed with the poorly designed user interface and functionality of the BT Webmail client. The e-mail layout is poor and un-inspiring.Couple this with glitches and freezing while trying to compose e-mails or execute commands,such as moving a message to a folder,a nightmare in itself,due to the user unfriendly drop down box,which doesn't always respond,when clicking on a item. Then you will know where this review is heading! Worse still,my outlook.com e-mail client will not work with the new BT Mail system,due to the BT Server,not accepting Outlook mails through it. The previous BT Yahoo service worked fine with Outlook.com! I could go on and on about this,but instead i would like to give a final piece of advice to anyone considering changing to the BT Mail,Webmail service.Don't!"
dain,Chester,1/18/16,"God Awful, Spoke to 5 different people and they told me 5 different things drawn out process and charged for a service not provided, broadband not provided until almost a month before contract begun and charged for extra month after being told 3 times they wouldn't (this is after giving them a months notice and phoning twice between this month notice given and months end to confirm no extra charges) They belong behind bars"
Anne,Surrey,1/18/16,"Signed up to BT 17 Mbps
Got 0.5! i.e. 97% less mbps than we signed up for.
We called to ask BT for help….they said they would “call us back” they never did.
We asked to cancel our contract (Note receiving only 3% of the Mbps meant they were not providing use a service fit for purpose)
BT said it would cost £140 to get out of their contract.
As we have 90 days left in the contract we offered to pay to the end of contract and that we were giving advanced notice of termination. BT said only when your contract has 30 days can you give advanced notice (not 90 days, not 29 days not 31 days….1 day in the year that you can cancel)"
A-Victim,"Barking, London",1/16/16,"My true rating for them is 0

After 13 years of faithful loyalty to BT, finally I have had enough. Not only their prices were ridiculous but my Broadband was interrupted as from September 2015 for no apparent reason and all attempts to troubleshoot it or repair it by me or them had failed. I called for an engineer and while he was in my premises double checking the equipment since he couldn’t find any logical reason for a fault, the internet had miraculously worked!! The engineer had confirmed that he didn’t know the reason behind the loss of Broadband or its sudden return, and the only explanation he could give me that it might have been enabled from outside!!! A few days later, the internet was back to its former useless state. This had confirmed my suspicions that BT themselves had interrupted my services as a technique to force me to call so that I get hassled about renewing my contract!!! So, I made it clear to everyone that I was not staying with them. Only less than a month after the expiry of my contract, I tried to leave but I was told that my contract was renewed!! I launched a complaint and was given so far three different deadlines they couldn't keep, to investigate how I was tied in a contract without my consent. Each time I called, they lied to their teeth about staff and they're messing me around. However, they are not giving me any feedback about the investigation and they’re playing the silent game. This is unethical, fraudulent but more importantly stupid. By using this technique, BT might be securing an extension of a contract for a while, but they are also making that client so bitter with them to the point of no return. I know that BT is a big fish and won’t go down easily, but even sharks get caught eventually. Although I feel for individual employees as they’re just you and me, the organization as a whole had lost its values and ethical foundation, the very thing that worked to its advantage only a few years ago, and this, in my opinion, is the beginning of the end for them."

Abbey,Denbighshire,1/14/16,"Dreadful service, diabolical customer service (if you can get through and have time to sit in queue for an hour), useless complaints service. Poor speed! Not fit for calling broadband. Never use this company!!!"
Paul Cain,Weymouth,1/13/16,"Bt infinity currently running at 170 KILOBYTES per second, always dropping out, never over about 2 Mbps, absolute rubbish and don't have time to hang on the phone for hours. BT speed test cant even detect speed because it is running too slow!"
Adam b,Hull,1/13/16,"5 times I've ordered broadband. 5 times they have messed up the order.""it's a technical issue. The order has to be re progressed"". About 10 hours on the phone. Still no broadband. They never phone you back and won't register a complaint. If your a masochist with a penchant for having the same conversation 20 times I would highly recommend. Otherwise you could achieve the same level of hair pulling frustration and emotional pain by clamping your testicles in a vice."
John,Leeds,1/13/16,"WiFi keeps dropping from BTHub3 router, speed of WiFi dropped to 0.18Mbps v 4Mbps with a 3G/4G hub. 2 week outage for phone and BB with no explanation. Left them now thank God. Worst service I have ever experienced."

Trevor,North Devon,1/9/16,"Broadband is unreliable, keeps going on & off, when you phone up you are speaking to somebody in India, max speed from my exchange is 8mbps, at the moment I have 0.2mbps. In all not at all happy with BT."
James,London,1/9/16,"I recently move to live in the centre of Europe's 2nd largest city. I was a previous (disgruntled) BT customer with 10 months left on my contract when I made the move to London. BT insisted on sending an engineer out for installation in my new home even though the previous occupant of my property was also with BT. This took 3 weeks, but I was prepared for that. When the engineer came he said that a) there would have been no need to physically disconnect the previously installed connection - but nonetheless it had been disconnected manually by a BT subcontracted engineer (not him though). and b) He thought there might be some damage to the connection which could have been cause by the previous BT engineer 'ripping out the connection' (obviously I can't verify this because this relates to the condition of the wires outside my building which I am not legally authorised to touch). Since installation my Infinity Unlimited broadband consistently fails at peek times, and is interment in the middle of the day. I work from home and I need to use the internet during the day and during peek times - hence why I wanted an unlimited package. BT will do nothing at all for me because the internet is intermittently working (just not when you most need it to work!!!). I have absolutely no recourse and I can do nothing to solve the issue. I suppose I could pay over £100 to get an engineer out (I mentioned getting an engineer out and BT customer services advised me that they could send one but I would have to pay for it.. and wait 3 weeks). BT prefer their customers to hand over money for a fixed term contract and except whatever poor levels of service their antiquated nefariously procured telecoms system will deliver. All they have to offer me is their 'understanding' of my concern and frustration. Not anywhere near good enough. Hateful crooks."
Customer,Kent,1/9/16,"Love their new customers, couldn't give a toss about their existing ones."
Chris,Hodgson,1/9/16,"This firm is basically satanic. Utterly useless in providing service and then contemptuous in every conceivable way when dealing with any problem. There lines and systems are basically not fit for purpose and they lie about this saying that your equipment is faulty.
They deliberately tried to decive me on the inception of the contract.
You would be better in my view with a length of string and two polystyrene cups. I am now with a independent supplier B4RN which is awesome and has great customer support."
peter,east lothian,1/9/16,"Horrendous service. Was stupidly drawn back to BT by a special offer. Cancelled the order, after 6 hours on the phone to hopeless helplines having conversations I'd had 20 times before with incompetent staff, trying to resolve simple set up issues. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
El diablo,West Scotland,1/9/16,BT are completely and utterly useless.Spent god knows how many hours on the phone to an Indian call centre trying to get a line with broadband installed in a new home in Western Scotland.Still waiting after 3 weeks.They really should be ashamed of themselves and Ofcom should come down on them like a ton of bricks.
lionodub,glasgow,1/9/16,"BT internet is probably the worst out of all the providers out there. Why is this? Well if you leave your router on overnight, 90% of the time you will have to reset it as it comes buggy and download speed become so slow you want to blow your brains out. After resetting our router 90% of the time the lights will flash orange and stay there for a good 5 minutes. This means that there is some kind of internet connection error. When it eventually wants to work you never get the download speeds you pay for. I have 13mb/s appaerently tops i get 4 and a good day 7. Stingy company limit the use of your browsing speed. So unreliable that if you play games you f.king spike evey 5 minutes or so, which means ending the other side of the map. Cant handle more that 2 computer users at once because LAG. The funny part about bt is you could have a supercomputer and they be like 'have you restarted your computer sir?' 'Have you got a virus sir?' 'Is your phone signal good sir?' 'Maybe its because you are too far away from the router sir' 'is there any devices such as phones which could disrupt the signal sir' 'Do one or more people live in your house sir which could interfere with the signal sir?' 'How many devices are connected to the router sir?' The biggest load of bu11sh1t you can think of they will ask. F them. Companies such as virgin media are like gods compared to this crap. 0 stars."
Sophie,Manchester,1/8/16,"Anyone thinking of taking any product with bt DONT after being told everything would be installed last month it is still not.

Gordon Osborne,Kettering,1/7/16,"Sad Sad sad!!! Years ago worked for BT when it provided a brilliant customer focussed service! Yes it had not been privatised. Now! Take out TV and Broadband contract 30th December, TV not operable remote and box suspect, engineer booked for three hour slot! Does not arrive one hour on phone to India three contacts. Transpires engineer reported not enough parking space? (There was!) But not contact!
Moral unless you have parking for gigantic vehicles! Dont use BT.
On their plus side presented first bill within 6 days , so they can be quick.
Also may help if you can speak Indian."
Rhodri Williams,Anglesey,1/6/16,"It's a shame I have to give a minimum of one star, I can not even fathom how this garbage company can even exist.
Our internet and land line went down on the 17th of December, it is now the 6th of January and it seems that nothing has been done to fix the problem.
Must be since we live away from crowded areas that BT couldn't care less if their services work or not.
The best part is that they still feel like it is acceptable to bill is for a month of nonexistent services.
Even when we try and try to phone them to see if any progress has been made, we get put through to someone useless person on the other end who couldn't care less about our situation and we have been hung up on several times. The deadline for this problem to be fixed has been postponed several times, first it was the 22nd, then the 24th. Then they decided to give themselves a bit of room to sit on their chairs and do nothing so it was the 4th and then they said and I quote 'it will definitely be fixed by the 6th, 100%' and here I am on the night of the 6th wondering how BT even have customers anymore. I honestly wouldn't wish this sort of service into my worse enemies. Absolutely appalling!"
Tim,Northumberland,1/6/16,"OK until something goes wrong. One of the most frustrating customer service experiences I've ever had. I reported a fault on the 19th December and have received nothing but empty promises since. I was initially told that things would be up and running by the 24th Dec. I rang on the 24th and was told to wait until the 31st. I rang on the 31st and was told the line would be fixed on the 4th Jan. I called on the 4th and was told it would be ready on the 5th. Called on the 5th, told it would be ready today. Have just come off the phone having being told I'll now have to wait until the 8th before they can fob me off again. Same excuses every time. On top of that I still haven't had a call divert put in place that was promised to me on the 4th Jan. I've been a customer with you for years."
David Connelly,Ayr,1/6/16,This service is very poor the signal drops regularly and is not available in all rooms of the house. The customer service is not helpful as they have advised to go back to Sky when I challenged their poor service.
Brad,Midlands,1/6/16,"Product (infinity 2) is drastically overpriced, but it works,isn't too slow, no complaints about service! Router isn't bad either :) but, when asked if I want to keep my phone number I said yes, they changed it, I've since called 10+ times and the only thing they've managed to do is change my number to another completely random number, ridiculous. I was also unable to login to my BT, so unable to pay bills and see details for 3 weeks, this has since been sorted. Customer service is terrible. Bt is good, if it goes to plan."
Steve,Leeds,1/6/16,"Spent over 30 hours on the phone, BT took four months to turn on broadband and decided to turn sport on and off as they pleased despite me paying for it. During my 12 month contract they decided to 'auto-recontract' me for a further twelve months from when they finally got broadband working - this is a bullying tactic by BT and I did not agree to extend my contract. I've just come to the end of a three month debacle (phone, email, all sorts of charges being added on) to finally get rid of BT. Stay away not worth the hassle at all!"
carolyn fox,shropshire,1/5/16,"I would give minus 1 if I could same old as everyone else, my phone bills only ever were 50.00 month max moved to bt when we moved house now touching £115.00 month when I was assured max bill would be £40.00 I also felt staff were very smug when speaking to poor trained staff.
I will now only communicate through email until my contract finishes next month YIPPEE!!!
I am now in communication with the Ombudsman and advise everyone on this website to do the same"
Michelle,Plymouth,1/5/16,"We had our phone line and broadband fitted on 32/12/15 but we have yet to have any service from BT. We have called BT on numerous occasions and all they keep saying is, you have to wait 24 hours for the broadband to get set up. Call again, still no internet... Oh it's showing as order is incomplete, you'll have to wait another 24 hours. Again checked this morning and yet again still no internet. It's a joke! We are extremely unhappy with their shocking bad customer service. Rude and incompetent customer service team who seem to pass on the buck to another member of staff. Fed up with it now, wish we had Virgin in our area!"
Lee,Lichfield,1/5/16,"Disgusting. Lower than dirt. Lower than bedrock!

I have had another of many terrible experiences with this diabolical company. This time I was due to finally get a way overdue broadband a month ago. 4 times they were supposed to come. 4 times they failed to with absolutely no notice. 4 afternoons I've booked off from work as they say make sure someone is home! Plus I am now past their 14 day cooling period so if I call and say forget it, I have to pay anyway! Their customer service agents are disrespectful and rude, with a cLearly uninterested attitude. Due to my location, I can't get access to any other broadband provider at the moment. BT are not only aware of this, they are the ones that pointed this out to me! If you are in an area that can get any other service, do it"
Andrew Davies,Slough,1/5/16,"Absolutely rubbish, keep sending engineers to fit a line when there is only a bit of rope in the manhole/duct then they find the duct stops a foot from the local point. Today I had to kidnap the engineer and ended up with the police on the phone to BT to explain how rubbish they were!"
Rhys,Cardiff,1/5/16,"BT is terrible. I'm typing this review from my mobile phone as the house broadband has failed for the second night running which has meant that the new Samsung TV can't now be watched and although the stupid BT box has been restarted (for the third time), the internet still fails to work. I advised against switching from Virgin, looks like I was right. Avoid BT like the plague - it's useless."
Paul Bennett,West Midlands,1/3/16,Sold me broadband the fastest you can get ye right it never worked they couldn't connect me then they told me it would take 30 days to connect me & I wouldn't get full speed I cancelled sent it back & moved over to sky bt carried on taking payments out of my bank I thought it was for line rental found out when sky take over they take on the line rental as well bt have done nothing but tried to rip me off since as I can't get my money back off them I would never consider ever using bt again & wouldn't trust them don't do it go with sky or anyone else
SueM202,Kinross-shire,1/2/16,"We have BT Infinity, in the last 6 months, we have only received acceptable download speeds for 6 weeks, mostly the speed in the evening is around 5mbps, we should be getting a min of 60. What a rip off, as soon as Virgin hit this area, they have a new customer waiting!"
Andrew sanderson,York,1/2/16,"Terrible service, appalling communication , non existent customer service .
I have been a client for eighteen months and requested an upgrade , it has taken nearly 6 weeks to date , I have made 8 hours of calls , have been on hold for 4 hours, and now have been disconnected with no explanation but have been charged . Please do not subscribe to BT you will regret it"
Gareth,London,12/31/15,
michael coates,oldham,12/30/15,"As a rule I don't use the internet alot. But when I do I am most disappointed with the speed. I upgraded 2 years ago to fibre and have not seen any great change.
Just this month I bought a TV box for films, these are downloaded off the nett which has pushed my use up. I have now realised I only get 40Mb, so anything over is chargable. I read my average use has previously been 14Mb. So a little disappointed and looking to improve my allowance and service."
Bobby,Cirencester,12/30/15,Awful service. I ordered over a month ago. Was given an install date for an engineer to visit my house. He never turned up. They never called. I called them to be put through to a Indian call centre to be told i would get a call back within 48hrs. I received nothing. two more times i called two more times waiting for a call back... nothing. How they can run a company i do not know.
David James,Kidsgrove,12/29/15,"Absolutely dire. Changed from Sky to BT a couple of months ago, to take advantage of the BT Sport offer. Worst decision I've made. I'll be contacting them after Christmas to see if I can come out of my contract early. Download speed is measured in minutes not seconds. Broadband disconnects virtually every day, usually in the middle of something. Kids complaining as buffering makes playing games on their PCs/Xboxes is almost impossible. I remember having internet connection 20 years ago via telephone line which was better than this."
frank skull,wroughton,12/28/15,
Geoff Livesley,Lowton,12/26/15,
Stephen,Lancashire,12/26/15,Customer service is appalling. Customer services are farmed out to India who are generally unhelpful. After 2 months I gave up trying to get my e-mail set up and got an outlook address instead. They still send e-mails to me at a Google address which I don't use even after telling them that they were using the wrong address. As soon as my contract expires I will be moving to an alternative provider. All in All BT should be avoided
Felix,Somerset,12/23/15,"Normally by are on a par with most services, although being the leading communications provider one would hope they would be above the rest, however my recent experience has shown a significantly worse side to the company. I reported a fault in the phone line over 10 days ago. They have still not committed to when they will fix it and have left me without telephone or internet. This experience has left me in outrage over the terrible response times. Sadly there is no other company we can switch to that can offer better service as they all run off bt's lines. I'm very disappointed in this company."
Colin,BRISTOL,12/23/15,"Having closed my account 3 years ago they went on and defaulted my account for 4 months later which affected my credit rating. Sent letter with details it was their fault, called 6 times and never heard back from them. 4 months waiting now and still nothing. Unacceptable and will never ever use again."
Eric,Poole,12/23/15,"Had no broadband since 07/12/2015 bt says they won't reinstate the service till 04/01/2016. Staff are doing anything to speed things up. No coordination within BT, keep being called by people who have no clue of what had been said before and keep repeating my self. Somebody should take the lead, but there is no ownersh of the case"
mj,london,12/23/15,"customer of bt fibre optic i recieved a phonecall from bt to continue my contract for a further time so i dont lose bt sport i agreee and a few months later bam btsport is chargable i was lied to and mislead.

They are not professional at all."

frank skull,swindon,12/20/15,"having been promised a telephone line engineer would install my line when i transfered to B.T. on dec 20 2013 instead an incompetent contractor turned up in an un-marked van, quickly carrying out some sub- standard wiring and left without checking the line with the result that myself 82 y.o. and my severely disabled 79 y.o. wife was left without a phone for 19 days over the festive season and B.T. couldn't care less, it was two years ago today and i,m still fighting for a settlement, i am now in my 83 year and I have never dealt with a worse firm, they rely on their call centre workers to make all the excuses while their managers are un-obtainable in their ivory mansion in Durham, definitely a no star company which prospective customers should stay well away from as they don't know the meaning of customer service and as for satisfaction you will get none with B.T."
Jake,Stroud,12/19/15,
john reid,east kilbride,12/19/15,The worst broadband you could get. Have to reboot every 30 min or so . Absolute rubbish going back to Virgin asap.
Stephen Spencer,Derby,12/19/15,"I have changed provider from Virgin to BT. Want to go back to Virgin because phone does not receive incoming calls even after 19 days. BT want to charge me £283 for changing back. Had 2 appointments for an engineer to come out and repair, Neither time did anyone come. Customer care outsourced to India. The people are very hard to understand, and do not resolve the problem. Absolutely totally frustrated. I have never known of such poor service before. I wish I had not changed provider to BT."
Angie,Wheldrake,12/19/15,Paying for 30mbps. Delivering less than 5. Insist my speed is fine. Whole village having same problem. Still not listening. Unbelievably bad

David Smith,West Yorkshire,12/15/15,
Elizabeth,Oxford,12/14/15,"I have had BT BB for years and only recently changed to Infinity. I live in a rural area miles from the exchange so I had thought the Infinity would not be much faster. Set up was easy and it has made a vast difference when downloading, especially on my SKY box, but also updates on computer and such like. BT Broadband has always been reliable for me even on the old HUB3 and the new HUB 5 likewise. Love the new fast Infinity. Unlike other reviews I have always had good customer service from BT."
Amy,England,12/14/15,"If I could give not stars to BT I would, joined them very recently as I was moving into a new house. The customer service is an absolute farce, it is outsourced to India, where most staff members seem to speak very little English, which therefore means it takes a very long time just to explain the simple reason you're calling. Second to this I've had the call staff outright lie to me, and also provide me with information that is completely incorrect, so much so I've told them that and they've still assured me it is correct. They told me the engineer didn't need access to the property, yet he did and I wasn't there. They then refused to tell me when I could reschedule the appointment to. They moved my broadband activation date by over two weeks, and neglected to tell me, which is an outrage as I need the internet to work. All in all I have been utterly flabbergasted by how much of a farce the customer service of BT is, and that they have the audacity to call themselves British Telecom. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Loopy,"Devon, UK",12/14/15,"Mmy advise is stay clear!! There are so many hidden costs, loop holes for them to CHANGE the offers and add CHARGES. And the customer services are more interested in getting additional services from you than fixing the ones you have with them."
Connor,,12/12/15,Couldn't be unhappier with BT. The speed is okay AT BEST but what we have cuts out every few minutes. Trying to go on phone apps is just impossible if they require an internet connection and online gaming is a thing of the past. If I could reliability an honest rating I'd go with -5 stars. I will be switching to any other service as soon as possible. I highly recommend someone else.
James,Bristol,12/11/15,"3 months of awful offshore telephone support which resulted in a service that could not be used from day 1, and a £300 early cancellation fee. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - If something goes wrong you will regret it."
Dave L,Linton on Ouse,12/11/15,"I have been with BT (latest version) now (not by choice) for around 6 months. I have moved into a rural area of the country and half expected this. On moving from my last location I did what normal people do and asked around the various internet providers, had a few offers but decided to go with BT. I have previously been with Virgin (who I say were flawless) and i miss this level of service as BT haven't lived anywhere near to them. I need to go onto my 3G internet if I want to do anything fast. My internet cuts off ""most reliable ever"
Simon,Kingston,12/11/15,"You know what dial-up was quicker than this. and woe betide if your connection is lost, you will spend hours on the phone to someone who doesn't care. At one point they switched my landline number with someone else! I am leaving."

Sirous,West Hampstead,12/9/15,
Brian,Norfolk,12/8/15,"After many years of problems with talk talk, contacted BT. I was assured that I would have a better service from BT, including the ability to discuss problems with an operator in the U.K.. In practice, the broadband has just been off for another three days (the seventh time this year) and again I have had to waste time talking to operators overseas (in India) some are very difficult to understand and some very unhelpful (one would not even discuss the fault, just said that we needed a new filter, which she would order for us - that was months ago - no filter ever received). I have tried to contact an bt rep. in England, who could probably resolve the problems - but this seems to be impossible. BT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY BAD, the only difference with Talk Talk is that their operators seem to be in several coutries, whereas BT are all in India!."
Ronnie Vincent,Kent,12/8/15,"Have currently given 5 stars but only came on line today. Was with Orange / EE (from the days of Lineone) and for the last 3 / 4 years had problem after problem with them. Poor customer service, speed issues and more. Had a total of 5 routers sent to me, hung up on on numerous occasions and had an engineer out to the house. Finally after the last issue where the support desk simply did not understand what I was telling them put the phone down and immediately contacted BT to switch. From that moment on it's run like clockwork. The sales person right from the start advised me not to go for the top end as those speeds were not available in my area but infinity 1 between 28mps and 39mps were so I could have that at £10 per month as opposed to the 70mps plus deal at £30, result £20 saving already. Line rental already with BT, no change there. Went through all the details, bit long winded but they have to do it. He told me BT sport would be on my Sky that night, it was on before I came off the phone, change over day was the 8th, which it was and equipment would arrive a couple of days before, spot on again. I received paperwork and emails confirming everything including they were handling the switch from my current supplier, they were soon on the phone once that request hit them! Had an automatic call this morning telling me the broadband was up and running before I had a chance to swap over the equipment. Set it up, plugged it in and hey presto, all good. Speed good, box stable and wireless working faster than Orange ever did. Only glitch is email? To get access to the outgoing server you have to have at least 1 BT email account with a user name and password but that's not too sad. Hopefully it will continue like this or I will update my review.
And no I don't work for or have anything to do with BT, if there had been any problems the review would have reflected that. Seeing that there was only negative reviews on thought I would share my positive experience"
Clark Smith,"Ayr, South Ayrshire",12/7/15,"5 months of sheer hell!
losing connection every few minutes.
Service centres try but fail to make any real difference. I have now spent hours and days on the telephone but it only results in an increase in blood pressure. To anyone thinking about BT, the first step in risk assessment is""To avoid""
I rest my case."
Paul,London,12/7/15,
Tim,SW London,12/6/15,"I've been with BT for longer than I can remember 6 or 7 years I think(since Pipex sold out). Upgraded over that time as new services came available - from regular broadband, to Infinity and now Infinity 2. I have never had a service outage and never had a router problem. YouView box for TV is another matter, but customer service was excellent when needed for that.
Broadband speed has always been consistent and fast, with no noticeable slowdown at any time of day.
I visited this site to check EE reviews as their packages are much cheaper than BT. EE reviews are dreadful and shocked to see BT don't fair much better. Maybe we only get our pens out when seriously miffed, and sit contentedly idle when all is well? As a very happy long term BT customer thought I should buck the trend!"
Symjeon,London,12/5/15,I have moved house and BT couldn't any more the service i was paying for. I was advised that i can cancel the contract without any charges as it wasn't my fault that they can't provide the service any more but guess what. I have just found a charge of £304.87 for early termination!!!! NO BT AGAIN IN MY LIFE.
lee,Lancs,12/5/15,"This is the worst provider that i have ever used. Internet fails on a daily basis, and they will do very little to try to put it right. wont release me from the contract but dont provide the service that i pay for. £363 cancellation fee if i want to leave.
do not take a contract out with these idiots.."
Sophie,Shropshire,12/2/15,"Such a poor service. Did not revive any services that were booked in regards to moving our phone and Internet to our new property. All conversations were denied that an engineer was ever booked when I approached BT via phone call. So moved to another provider due to BT's in competence. Then two months later I've received a bill for a service that I've not even used. There is not even any person living in our new house so there's no possible way a bill could have been built up.
Absolutely appalled and BT will not be recieveing a penny from me. Don't fall in to their trap!! You will get stung!!"
SeanSulli,Scotland,12/1/15,"I left Plus Net to move over to BT why someone please tell me.
Any inkling of a problem with plus net was followed up immediately by a call centre in the UK. We went over to BT for the promised TV, promised faster line speed and promised sport. Still waiting for at least one promise but over two years later nothing. Saw the advertisement for fibre half price for the first year, so nothing ventured nothing gained and was told that is only for new customers if I wanted to upgrade the line rental and fibre would cost @ £50 a month. When you call with a problem it is put through to a call centre (eventually) in Asia has no-one informed BT management BT is short for BRITISH TELECOM. Was going to have a good rant but you have all beat me to it. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Total rubbish and as soon as lines are updated and we have an option who to be with it certainly will not be BT
Steve,Plymouth,11/29/15,Stay away - unbelievably bad! We have been stuck with poor service / reception for nearly twelve months. The router cuts out multiple times a day so all connection is lost. This even applies at night when you might expect the service to be good. Numerous calls to helpline in India did nothing to help. Engineer could not improve performance. So fed up with the poor service we tried to opt out with just a month on the contract to go - but £98.90 cancelation fee to do this. You can't even just pay the last month whilst using another provider - they will still charge the cancelation fee. Avoid BT - you will regret it for the length of your contract.
Kristina,London,11/28/15,"unreliable broadband throughout the day. Dips every single day during the day a number of times to zero which makes it impossible working from home.

Anna,Oxford,11/27/15,"THE most stressful set up you can possibly imagine. Beyond AWFUL set up service, Talktalk were angels in comparison to trying with BT. I paid for broadband, was told a date, hear nothing and there is no way of contacting them without spending an hour on hold after which you'll be sent to an overseas call centre. Had to call multiple times to ensure start then had the date postponed! Then received a letter saying credit control had tried to contact me (no they hadn't). Company is completely out of control, wish I'd read feedback and AVOIDED."

CHRIS,FAREHAM,11/25/15,"It seems impossible to get hold of somebody to talk to about my broadband issues, surely for a communications company I should be able to communicate with somebody when I have a problem!!!"
Swindled,County Durham,11/24/15,"PLEASE BEWARE THE UNLIMITED ""UP TO 17mbps"" offer, either online or by phone. Very sharp practice indeed, fraudulent by omission maybe?

BT, it seems, are deliberately not telling us that to get anywhere near 17mbps (11mbps seemingly is now possible in our case) you more than likely need to ""upgrade"" to ""faster unlimited"" This is not offered by the sales staff or online!

I guess most are aware most BT departments have a pretty poor reputation for customer service and also for many of us rural customers, terrible broadband speeds and poor reliability is the norm - we get 2.5 to 3.5mbps and it the line drops regularly.

You wouldn't believe the conversation with the upgrade personnel who don't seem to think that the sales team should give us that information when ordering and nor is not present as an available upgrade on the MY BT website either. You need to dig very deep to discover anything about it (googling it is the best way) and even then there are no prices - you have to phone the self-righteous upgrade team.

Local investment has paid for fibre to our local cabinet, (copper to the property) but we must pay BT an extra £13.50 per month plus connection fee (on top of the £7.50pm 12 month offer we're on) to achieve any faster speed. Full fibre and much faster speeds, if I was available to us would only be £5.00 more according to the current deals at BT.

If BT had told me that it would cost substantially more to get a half decent speed when our cabinet was upgraded shortly after I ordered, I would have signed up with another supplier. It is currently possible to get the hybrid fibre/copper supply with a speed of 11mbps guaranteed for £10 per month.

The upgrade lady proudly proclaimed that BT are not the cheapest - at least we got some truth there!!"
Simon,Camberley,11/23/15,"BT = Broken Telecoms.
I've had similar experience of the BT service as a residential customer. Since moving to cable (Virgin) I've never looked back. I'm now once again experiencing the BT disaster on the company connection, if indeed connection is the right word. Intermittent issues going on for weeks. Seemingly with no resolution. Engineers contacting once in a while just to see if the problem has fixed itself, at least it feels that way. They really come across as clueless. Wouldn't recommend them unless you literally couldn't get hold of 2 tin cans and some soggy string."
Rachel Jones,London,11/22/15,"Very unreliable service; especially over the last 3 month. The broadband speeds over the last week have been very slow and my infinity broadband stopped working 2 days ago. Last month my phone stopped working for a week. Customer service is almost on existant. Overall opinion, don't use BT."
abdi,london,11/21/15,"The worst experience with bt broadband ever.We ordered this broadband 10 months ago and its the worst broadband ever.I called them up about the problem and they kept me on the phone for more than 3 hours transferring me from one department to another and the end result was that they never ended up no where, they just kept taking me to different departments.The worst customer service ever.Most of the people are uneducated.I am planning to leave before the contract and I'm even going to pay for the charges. I also have bt infinity.So my advice to anybody thinking of ordering bt infinity, don't order it because the broadband is rubbish and the customer service is absolutely horrendous."
Dimeji,London,11/21/15,"Oh my God! This is the worst broadband ever.
Firstly, we transfered from SKY to BT and this took BT over 2 months to fix and validate our transfer and process the order.
Secondly, we you call, they keep transfering you to about 10 to 15 different people before someone eventually gets to listen to your problem.
We have received more than 10 different dates for an engineer to come to install the broadband. Each time I called when an engineer failed to visit, the usual annoying response was ""sorry I couldn't see your order on our system"". I have had to RAISE MY VOICE on several occasions out of anger and frustration.
Eventually when the broadband was installed, it had been one nightmare after another. The broadband is extremely very slow with download speed reading between 3 Mbps to 10 Mbps when it should really be over 70 Mbps.
I have called several times with no success.
BT braodband is a woe and total failure.It wouldn't take me many days now before I cancel my direct debits with them and move back to SKY or go with VIRGIN."
Sean G,Sittingbourne,11/20/15,"Summary of my BT experience:

1. They cancelled the engineer without telling me so I am left waiting for him at home like a mug having taken a day off work for it.
2. They tried to deny that the engineer was booked in the first place then they denied it was a free offer on the 78MB/S fibre so they clearly don't know their online customer e-commerce experience.
3. I was passed between 4 different advisors 5 or 6 times each claiming I needed to speak to someone else before someone finally decided to take responsibility.
4. They offered a convoluted solution which involved me paying £130 for the engineer and then phoning them again to claim it should be free (unprofessional) wasting another day of my life and a potential dispute over the cost of the engineer.
5. The presale broadband estimated speed was D/L 60M/Bs it is 50MB/s (hugely off and misleading). 2nd day into bedding in (you're supposed to allow 3) but I highly doubt it will go anywhere near 60. THIS and the free engineer socket replacement was THE reason I chose BT.

My advice: Go with Sky if you possibly can over BT - their (BT) customer service is absolutely horrific and I hope I will never have to phone them again when the contract is up next year I will definitely be switching to someone else.

Detailed experience:

I wanted to go with Sky as I had heard only good things about their overall service and flexibility but apparently being the responsible suppliers they are, they did not have any more fibre deals available for my exchange as they keep the numbers reasonable to reduce the contention ratio and thereby provide a better service during peak times to the sum of their customers.

From the remaining suppliers I opted for BT despite the fact that I had received a number of warnings about BT broadband from friends and even my wife as well as reading reviews, but I never expected it to be this bad only two days into my service.

I ordered the service online on 06/11/2015 for my new home. This was for the 78/19MB/s fibre service including phone line. In the ordering process I was presented with an option to book an engineer at no extra cost (£50 for lesser deals) or self install the service. I chose for the engineer to come around because it included him/her replacing the phone socket to a more suitable location.

The phone line was activated on 09/11/2015
The fibre was activated on 18/11/2015
The engineer was booked for 20/11/2015

So here I am, taking a day off work, on the 20th sitting twiddling my thumbs waiting for the engineer to come. At around 1pm I got a little concerned and checked up on my order online and noted that the engineer appointment had magically disappeared. So I phoned BT and was fobbed off to one department after another and back again. They claimed that the engineer was not necessary but then I explained that it was part of the deal that I bought so eventually after an hour or more on the line, they offer to send an engineer but to charge me £130 for it!!!

They said that they will charge but then I phone them back and tell them that it was supposed to be free (not very professional at all) and to get the amount credited to my account. I asked them to send an email to confirm that the conversation but the advisor refused and said she would put a note on my account for when I called. I acquiesced to this and asked when the engineer would come and I was given a date of 1st of Dec which coupled with the ordeal of having to phone them again put me off completely and I told them to forget it and I would hire an engineer myself which I have done at a cost of £120."
Karina burrows,St Ives cornwall,11/19/15,"Well after reading all the reviews I have now decided most definatly not going to sign up with them , I find it appalling that such a large company can't get it right ! Why don't they employ someone to look at these problems and sort them out if we did our jobs as poorly as they do we wouldn't be in business ."
Kevin,Sussex,11/19/15,"It's outrageous that this inept, incompetent and careless monopoly have complete control over the nations telecom lines via openreach and get paid £millions of tax for doing such a shoddy job."
Dunromin,Midlands,11/18/15,"Apart from the initial sales process the support is appalling. BT have changed my phone number 3 times, they blamed the initial change on Virgin (?) and they have never accounted for the other 2.I switched to BT from Sky last April. My main gripe is the dropping of the internet to my Windows 10 laptop, the MyView and the 2 Nexus we have. It think it might be a BT security problem as resetting the router fixes it, but is a pain. BT have replaced the router but this hasn't fixewd the problem. The technology is brilliant I get a consistent 37Mb download speed, the roaming WiFi service is good and has a lot of convenient access points. The new router fitted through the letterbox so I didn't have to callect in 48 hours later from the sorting office. If I had never had to talk to them I would think the system excellent. I switched from Sky who we inherited from O2. Sky had excellent customer service, I only moved away because of the cost for the new year after the intro, there roaming service is also very good but the coverage is less.If I can a deal I will go back to Sky."
Happy,South East UK,11/17/15,My change from standard broadband to infinity worked seamlessly. Hub delivered on time and upgrade occurred without me having to do anything or even be in. It's true I had to a MAKE a firm point about new customers being charged less but as a loyal customer I was given a very good deal. Other providers may be a bit cheaper but I'm not game to move given how well BT has always worked for me. I'm not sure they always give the same info when you ring up so you do have to be rather on the ball but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Very happy with BT
Gleed,Borough green,11/17/15,"BT are literally the worst company I have ever known, there customer service is discussing every single person I have spoken to must be the most incompetent people Iv ever had conversations with in my life. None of them communicate. They cancelled my account without telling me then took over 10 days to set up a new one so was 2 weeks without broadband or a telephone line in a terrible area for signal, after notifying them I had a new born baby and need a telephone line asap. I confirmed with one of the staff I was not paying the one off charge £35 set up few as their service was a disgrace, she discounted that and I paid my bill. They
have now today decided to take £35 from my account for the set up fee that was agreed I didn't have to pay and they tell me it takes 3-4 days to look into the phone calls which will prove I'm right and then will take up to 10 days to get my money back. They are an absolute disgrace I would be embarrassed to work for the company DO NOT USE THEm UNLESS U HAVE TO unfortunately I'm in a new build and we have to use BT."
Bill,Oxfordshire,11/17/15,"I just moved and signed up for BT including their BT TV youview package. Broadband fine, but in order to use the TV package you need an aerial, not a dish. My house is new and has a dish but no aerial so it doesn't work. Would not have purchased had I known this in advance."
qwerty,Coventry,11/16/15,I've had BT broadband just over two years. I have had to have an engineer call out five times. The customer service is beyond awful. The trouble is that BT supplies broadband for all the other providers so what can you do? It's an outrageous monopoly. What a shame BT wants to supply sports instead of sticking to its knitting an providing a decent broadband service. I'll be switching to fibre as soon as it is available in our area from anyone except BT.
X Smith,UK,11/16/15,I'm a new customer to BT having suffered low speeds and endless drop outs with Sky for a year. I wouldn't have believed it but BT's speed is worse and their customer service is shocking. I've been trying to resolve an issue with my logon for 11 days but despite saying they will respond within 24 hours I have not received a response. I've tried to live chat with them but the slow broadband speed is hampering those attempts. The only good thing I can say is that my broadband doesn't drop out as much as it did with Sky.
Genius,Cambridge,11/16/15,"2email accounts' whole inboxes we removed and put into ""deleted"" folders. When I asked why this was happening an Indian adviser informed me I could go to BT help to recover these emails. I wanted to know WHY the emails had been moved I'd already discovered them. Then he said there was a ""glitch"" on his BT computer and could no longer help me. This service is at best useless and there just is no accountability by BT for their appalling service to paying customers. Their help menus are useless. Why not give out telephone numbers as, on occasion, customers who phone them are unable to use the internet because it has failed! We've been told throughout 2015 that BT were dumping Yahoo but this still hasn't happened and BT are still not being held to account for the useless service on Yahoo email accounts. Extremely poor service by BT to its customers."
Charandeep,Southall,11/15/15,"Paying for 76mb and on a good day today n the middle of the night I manage to get 24mb. I do not live in the countryside and two roads down they get 60-80mb. Bt can not explain why this is, they only say the exchange is too far from my house. Really disappointed"
Sam,Derby,11/15/15,Everyhing bt provides is rubbish..i hate bt with passion
Kathryn,Redcar,11/13/15,"Phone service rubbish, broadband rubbish. They miss service appointments and mess you around.
I always thought they would be the best but they are terrible."
geoff,poole,11/13/15,Just received a package and after 4 days I have found out customer service is based in India and very poor. Promised a call back but never got one. They wait until you have to pay to cancel. I am trapped for a year now and will then leave them never to return. Not to be trusted.
Nules,Bournemouth,11/12/15,"Very disappointed and actually appalled with BT's customer service. Diabolical.
We signed up to a BT Infinity package last December and when discussing the package on the phone my husband stressed it was important the new package would retain the ""International Freedom""package as I'm from Ireland and call there several times a week. Since we signed up apparently ""online"", we never received a paper quarterly statement, and just recently we discovered on going through our household bills that for the past 10 months our BT bills (paid by direct debit) had doubled as were taken off the 'International Freedom' option when the BT Infinity contract started last December!
BT have no interest whatsoever in trying to put matters right given that we calculate this mistake has cost us approx £600 in 10 months. We are very disappointed given that we have been with BT for many years and they have absolutely no interest in retaiing our business. My husband wrote a long letter to the customer service dept in Durham and received by way of response an incredibly poorly written shprt email (terrible grammar) basically saying ""computer says No"" without responding to the individual points raised in our letter.
Separate to this incident I will also say that we had phone line problems twice in the same period, the most recent one meant we were without a phone for approx a week. Very Poor.
Anyhow actively seeking an alternative supplier and would urge you all to do the same!"
Delyth,Cardiff,11/12/15,"Swapped from Sky. DON'T DO IT!!!
I was supposed to have my broadband a week ago- still not been set up which is ridiculous considering I need the internet for work purposes. Now told it won't be sorted until at least Monday (that's 11 days with no internet) Keep getting lied to. 'We'll ring you with an update'....three times I've been given that message. I've had to spend countless evenings on hold. Worst company ever. Makes me think it's cheap for a reason."

po,ki,11/10/15,Broadband keeps disconnecting from wireless devices and its speed always fluctuates. One minute im getting 30mbps and the next im getting 1mbps. tried to get help many times from bt but their employees are just useless and clueless. If virgin provided fibre optic broadband here i would switch without a trace of hesitation
gaye gilbert,somerset,11/9/15,"All went well until broadband kept crashing! then customer service failed bt no end. I waited for phone calls that were promised but never came! It wasn't until I blew after no end of me calling them it has been decided to send me a new home hub but even then I have pay out for delivery!

NOT IMPRESSED!"
jaga,swanley,11/9/15,"Continuous appalling service since moving home and trying to transfer our old telephone number. On moving day text to say phone was up and running, but no service to house. On checking our number we find its gone to the local Bus Company. Constant ringing to Customer Services (via offshore call centre) we're told there is nothing wrong with the line. I agree, but say the line is not where it should be.
Over 3 weeks of continuous calls eventually get line transferred, but Broadband is connected / working. Further calls, delays no turn ups eventually get Broadband on. 2 days later it fails, faulty hub. New Hub sent, doesn't work resort to old server which works fine.
this weekend line / Broadband fails, no service. 3 hours so far on calls. I fear the nightmare is about to begin again.
BT service is appalling,"
adrian,Leicester,11/9/15,"absolutely shocking customer service, will never ever use bt again. after having to move house and being stuck in a contract with no way out than to pay an extortionate amount. rang them up 1 month before the contract was going to end and they said i cant cancel without a cancellation charge so i rang up once my contract ended only to be told i need to give 30 days notice that i wanted to cancel!!! and a cherry on the top was the fact that i also have to pay a £30 termination charge for cancelling my services altogether!!!!! absolute rip off and i will be complaining + going to trading standards with my experiences!!"
Edmond,Caterham,11/7/15,"A main pitch of BT Sales, why to switch to Infinity broadband, is a stronger more reliable connection. In the 7 weeks since switching it has proved the worst in 20 years of internet connection, even dial-up was better. Sporadic drops, possibly more frequent afternoon and evening. On my third Home Hub 5 which crashed my PC 10 minutes after plugging it in, BT deny any responsibility. Have referred case to Ombudsman, for what that may be worth, as I've had more than enough. Feel I was mis-sold fibre broadband as BT's revisionist line is they can improve things so I get ""fewer"" drops; well if drops had been part of the sales proposition then I would never have signed up at all."
ANTONY,swansea,11/6/15,"BT are useless, I have 40mb fibre optic which should be a good speed and I am receiving 2.1 mb, the customer service told me this was a good speed which is absolute nonsense"
S hacker,England,11/5/15,If I could give negative in all of the options I would I have called frequently to have my diabolical Internet reliability addressed and it feels as if I am given a generic excuse maybe a box to keep me happy and swiftly forgotten about. The issue has never gone away never improved and I have to jump through the same 50 hoops everytime I want to talk to anyone remotely human go to any other Internet provider and I mean any other... An Internet Cafe would be more reliable than this supposed service I am expected to pay for
Julian Jacobson,London,11/5/15,"Just joined BT phone + broadband + TV from Talk Talk. Can't complain about the service, but I will complain on two subjects. Receiving the equipment was diabolical, as I was told so many lies about delivery problems that I eventually received 2 sets of hardware within 2 days of each other and had to send one back. The other is the pricing policy. I joined 1 month ago, wasn't sure whether I would need 10G/month or unlimited, was told I could always upgrade later. Except that at the time of ordering the difference was £ 7, whereby if I do it now (1 month after joining) I have to pay £ 11/more more. ""Because you are already with BT"" I was told. And if I were to order the package now as a new customer, it would only pay £2.50 more!! Being a BT customer is definitely hazardous to the health of your portfolio..."
Jamie McLeod,Aberdeen,11/4/15,"Well all, i hope your ready for a long, truthful review of BT...

I switched to them on the 17th September of this year after 5 years with Sky. My Sky speed was reliable and constant at around 9mb p/s. We wanted to switch as a cost saving exercize by getting infinity and TV through BT at £65 a month instead of the £90 a month for Sky. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!

The order was placed on the 17th and the minimum guaranteed speed was 27mb with an email confirming the same and detailing within it (which i still have) that states that if the speed continually drops below this guaranteed speed i can cancel at any point. It must be said here that when i contacted Sky to cancel, they were reluctant to let me go and they even offered to price match BT but the thing that made me move was the guarnteed speed that Sky couldn't give.

Anyways, i signed up, cancelled Sky and got an email saying everything will be with you on the 29th September and all will be switched over within 30mins on the 1st of October. Well....

The 1st came and i plugged it all in and off we went, except we didnt. I contacted BT and after 15 minutes of being on hold i was transferred to someone in India to be told ""oh there is an issue with getting the line from Sky, you will need to wait until the 7th October"". Now you need to understand that i at this point had no internet or TV for a week. Not easy with 2 kids and working from home. Anyways, the 7th came and bingo, the line was ready...or so i thought. Plugged it all in and away we went, light on the hub turned blue, conneted to the internet, did a speed test to show i was now getting 3mb p/s. OK i thought, lets leave it a while and see what happens. Turned on the Youview box and the light on the hub turned orange...no internet. Left it a day and everytime i turned on the TV the internet dropped out so i was now in a situation where i could browse the net at 1/3 of my previous speed but not watch TV or i could watch TV but not get the internet channels, so i was basically paying to watch Freeview or browwse the net at stone age speeds.

So i contacted BT again and waited an age to get through to someone promising me the Earth who told me there must be a problem with the hub. So they informed me they will send me a new hub which will be there within a few days. It arrived on the 11th October. Plugged it in, away we went...NO CHANGE!!!

Now by this point i was beginning to get pi**ed off. Contacted them back and eventually got through to someone who as per all other calls wanted to start off by asking me what type of phone socket i had in my house etc etc etc. At this point i bit my tongue hard. Anyway, she told me she was going to send me new filters because they must be the problem. I swiftly told them NO, do not send me anything else. Send me an engineer. She didnt want to do this so i got refered to some sort of support line. They told me they needed 48 hours to do some checks on the line and they would call me back. Well that 48 hours came and went with no call. So i called them...AGAIN.

Got through to someone, they confirmed my line was OK to my house and that it was stable and that it must be something in the house causing the issue. Like, i told them 48 hours before hand. This was now the 14th October. No need for new equipment the person said. We will send an engineer. Great, progress at last.

3 Days later an engineer turns up from Openreach, now the 17th October and he changes the main socket in the house to an MK3. He gets the speed to 20mb/s and at which point i tell him that i have been promised 27mb/s or i can cancel. At which point he laughs and says ""you have no idea how many houses i go to with the same problem. BT promise speeds that they cant deliver"". He then says he is goin to the exchange to see what he can do. He returns shortly after to tell me the most i will EVER get at my house is 21mb/s and off he goes.

So in the midst of all this BT kindly take £70 out of my account on the 15th for my bill from the 17th September. Not impressed in the slightest i call and ask for a refund to be told that i cant get one until the issue is resolved. I quickly remark that it isnt resolved. The line keeps dropping when on TV or saying inadequate signal recieved please go to bt help.com.

I then tell her i want to cancel because the Openreach engineer has told me i will never get 27mb/s and i want to return to Sky. The lady was OK with this but she needed to refer me to technical support to see what they can do and that i will need to wait 7 days for a call back. Well, 7 days came and went and by now it was the mid-end of October. I called BT AGAIN, and explained the story AGAIN with the cancellations team to get the worst call handler yet and she was british. She had a stinking attitude. I explained i wanted to cancel and that i hadnt recieved a call from BT when i was promised. She rudely told me that someone from BT spoke to me on the phone at 1654 for 5 minutes. I reassured her that if i dial 1471 on my house phone, the last person to call it was a family member at 11.11 (by this time it was now 1800ish). She then said, no it was on your mobile. I took my mobile out of my pocket and looked to see if i had a missed call or whatever. I didnt. I was leaving for home from work at 1654. I told her that she is either lying or the caller is because i recieved no calls. She the proceeded to tell me that she is not a liar. I said, well can you tell me the conclusion of the call please? Can you check the notes of the call and tell me what was discussed because as far as i am concerened i am calling to cancel because i have not recieved the call, otherwise i wouldnt be calling. She then told me she cant access the notes of another caller (funny because all the other BT staff could read my previous notes). Anyway, after a lot of angry exchanges, i was told by her that her job wasnt worth cancelling my contract without technical saying so.

I asked her how long will it take to cancel if technical can put a note on the system saying its ok to cancel, she then said it could be cancelled straight away.

I asked her to put me through to technical support AGAIN. After 30 minutes on hold i get through to India. I am told by the tech support that the other call back didnt take place because the other caller didnt do anything about my cancellation request as he could (funnily enough) read the notes. He then said that he cannot put the cancellation request on the system until it goes through the line checks and technical for 7 days. So either he is lying or the cancellation lady is.

By this point i am losing the plot with them. He told me that he will lodge the call with tech support or whatever it is and that on the 3rd Nov they would call me back. They called and i said ""is it cancelled?"", he then said no not yet, we are still testing things or whatever they are doing. He confirmed the speed on the line is 20mb/s and he said it will take another 4 days. He said ""is 20m/b no fast enough for me""? I said, it doesnt matter if its fast enough, you promised me a certain minimum speed which i am not getting. I left Sky after 5 years for that sole reason. No other as the price was the same.

I will now await their call on the 7th Nov, at which point if its not cancelled and i am not reimbursed my £70 plus compensated via my phone bill, i will take the matter to a solicitor, watchdog and whomever else.

I would strongly advise EVERYONE who is considering BT to stay well clear of them. I have never in my life experienced such unprofessionalism or disrespect towards a customer as i have with BT and i will NEVER buy from them or reccommend them to anyone.

p.s. 2 weeks ago i asked the BT advisor if i was OK to go ahead and re-order Sky TV etc and she said yes. So if i am placed in a situation where i have 2 contracts to pay for a year i will be looking to sue them. I am glad all these calls are recorded because i have done nothing but try and cancel my agreement with them because of misrepresentation.

If i went to a showroom to buy a car and was only give 70% of it i'd be able to return it after being promised the whole thing. The same applies here."
Angela,Sileby,11/3/15,I was quite pleased with BT but there prices kept going up and up so I decided to leave them I received a letter which I found threading and because I am coming out my contract a bit before it ends the are going to charge me over £70 which I find exorbitant as being a pensioner that's a lot of money these companies have you over a barrel so be careful who you sign up with BT are not as good as you think they don't care about old customers.
Pat Lyons,Port Talbot,11/2/15,"Ive been with BT broadband/phone at one address since 23/5/2016 and also at another address have 02 Busines Broadband/phone. O2 are fantastic a 10/10 service.
BT on the other hand has been like going to a pub and having a bad pint every time. Each time ""Hello how are you today sir and here's your next bad pint at hotel prices.
I've almost resigned to cancelling my contract and paying up the 6 months £179.66 disconnection fee to restart anew with a supplier that has a high customer service. My broadband speeds are about the lowest Ive ever experienced. Why the hell does BT trade like this, excellent sales set up and no backup. My BT experience started off with them consistently installing the wrong phone number. I would then get a text from BT along the lines . We aplogies for installing the wrong number however the correct number has now been installed. Again and again the number was not correct and once again a wrong number so back to being on hold and going through it all again . Ive now had the correct number installed (I think) which has resulted in the following upgrade - I cant make incoming calls or outgoing calls and that has been the situation since last June. Its now be diagnosed today as a fault at the exchange and should be fixed within 3 days A long discussion on BT and compensation ensued. It ended with BT offering to refund £10 including VAT for the period in the first month when they charged £16.99 line rental. Ba Customer service is not on the agenda"
John,Stoke-on-Trent,11/2/15,"Changed to B.T. from talktalk due to tele sales person stating how much better B.T. will be. Bthub4, B.T sport, satellite wifi hot spots etc. What they don't tell you is how painfully slow the broadband speed is.When i complained they stated I was only on a tariff which guarantees a line speed of 12kb/sec, if I wanted a faster broadband then I should go to infinity tariff at an extra cost of 15£/month I already pay 29£/month which only gives me bt sport1. Unfortunately I am under a 12 month contract but when this expires I will leave and never return to bt. Buyers beware."
masud,gloucester road,11/2/15,this is one of big mistake to take bt contact.It is rubbish broadband in uk and very bad customer service i call them today about my broadband they said i have to pay 120 pound for solve this problem please dont take bt
Martin Cooke,Cornwall,10/30/15,"I am trying to switch from Talk Talk to BT, partly because of their BT Sports App. I am now very close to telling them to forget it, having wasted many frustrating hours in trying to contact someone who will (a) answer the phone within a reasonable time and (b) give me any reliable information as to how the switch is progressing. Even though I have confirmation of my order, they have now informed me that it has been held up somewhere within their ""system"". If BT really do want people to switch to them they are definitely not going the right way about it."
Unhappy BT Customer,London,10/30/15,"If I can give you one advice, please do not sign up to BT. I'm on their ADSL service, having transferred from Sky due to a new customer incentive and in hindsight one of the worst decisions I have made to-date and will be switching back to Sky the moment my contract expires later this year.
The service is unreliable in that I constantly suffer drop-outs, which is one thing, however their customer service team based in India is absolutely shambolic. Totally embarrassing and so painful to go through. If you value your time and sanity I would suggest never giving these guys a go. I did hear similar reviews prior to switching over and wished I had heeded the warnings. I have never left a review before, but the service has been so poor I felt compelled to let others know. You have been warned."
Tim,Oxford,10/30/15,"Please do not use BT if you have any other alternative. Sadly we didn't. BT's customer service is appalling! It's taken us 15 months and literally hundreds of phone calls to get infinity broadband installed in our office. Just one example - on the day the engineer was due to upgrade us to infinity we stayed in the office specially but nobody turned up and we had no communication from BT. They also cut-off our 'normal' broadband service. Customer services told me that due to a 'technical error' the order had got 'stuck' and they couldn't restart our normal broadband service until the next engineer visit. They said they'd call back in 2 hours with the next visit date. They didn't. A week later we got notification of the next engineer visit, 3 weeks later. On that visit the engineer did turn up but said he couldn't restart our broadband because all the information he'd been given about the exchange was wrong and the previous engineer's notes (the one who didn't turn up!) were incomplete. Back to customer services. The woman there had no record of any engineer visits and was almost in tears because Open Reach wouldn't take her calls. So it goes on..."
kerri,kings hill,10/30/15,"BT I would love to watch your programmes alas I have been waiting for an instillation of a phone line and Internet for weeks. I have had so many text messages stating we are coming today and never show up, never mind that I have to take a day off work!!! Then i call customer service and they tell me all the technicians are in training! Im sorrry to say it is terrible customer service and I am so disappointed."
Lindy,Shropshire,10/29/15,"Our broadband is constantly going off, fed up with being threatened with charges if a fault is not found and to topic all, had an appointment yesterday soda to stay in from 8am to 1pm. Sometime during the morning the broadband was going on and off so maybe an engineer was working on it. However no contact with us to say if work had been done or if problem fixed. Where is common courtesy at least a call to say what is going on. We are in a rural location which seems to be an excuse for poor service and low speeds. WE get better and faster broadband in the Bahamas on an island 5 miles long. It is possible but I guess we just do not matter enough."
Becky,Northamptonshire,10/28/15,"Totally shocking.
Indian call centre staff make promises, and don't follow up (calls, replacement routers etc)
U.K. Call centre no better.
Problem was only solved by talking to the cancellation dept, explaining all the lies and errors, and being put through to someone who had the ability to make a decision and not read off a script.
I'm.moving soon, and I won't be using BT for my broadband at the new address."
Wils,Finchley,10/28/15,"I'm actually in the same boat as the others customers with their reviews!!! This is a major mistake I made getting BT ... TV, Phone, Broadband... I got it all. I'm still waiting to get my Phone and broadband to get fixed. It's been a week! I had an engineer calling me asking me how long I have been with out broadband... He then tells my wife that someone had changed my phone connection into someone else's in those green boxes you see on the road. Ok, so I thought yeah, that's fixed. Got home nothing!!!! Checked online ... It tells me that it's fixed!!!! Sky overpriced, but the service is there!!!shame on this British company that calls it self British telecom !!!! Fix up!!!!"
Iain Anderson,Cumbria,10/28/15,
Clive Deakin,Lincolnshire,10/28/15,"I initiated a home process, so far so good.
An issue with trying to get BT infinity in my new home, even though the BT online checker said it was available. This was due to it being a new build and it needing a new phone line. I was told by the home move team once the service was installed they would review line speed and upgrade to infinity free of charge. Good so far.
Open reach turn up to the house to install the service (phone and BB) and line. To be told that i need a specialist to to the work - this even though they knew it was a new house. The builder had run a duct to the pole. Apparently it is a specialist job to do this. I'm then told it needs a sight survey and its 5 days before BT get date for this from openreach. I'm also told this was now being case managed. This is BT speak for - no one else in BT can talk to you about this and you can not get direct contact with the case management team. I assume this is a way of avoiding getting calls for frustrated customers.
Finally get the work done for engineer to say the original guy could have done this and was being a lazy so and so.
I now find my online bill is charging me for services for certain dates that i have not had.
Tried contacting BT about this, and guess what it is still with escalation team and they cannot contact them or raise it with them and I have to wait 5 days for the review date to come around before I get a call - if i ever do - as this has never happened yet.
What a great way for you to be managed and have no one resolve this as you can not get in touch with this team.
Time to move me thinks"
Andrea S,London,10/28/15,Very bad and customer service don't know well their products. They give different information at every phone call. Website upgrades are not clear. Same bad as sky ..
Paul MacGregor,Lincolnshire,10/28/15,"For the last 5 years I have experienced terrible, shocking service from BT as a company.
I wouldn't mind so much if their product was decent but it's nothing short of garbage. It is 2015 and we shouldn't have to put up with painfully slow broadband, it's embarrassing! So we pay for 10mb download and receive less that 1.8 - how is that acceptable.
I can honestly say that Virgin was a lot better.
BT know they have no competition so treat their customers like rubbish because they have the monopoly and just DO NOT CARE about me or you!
My advice is go to the top and bypass these people who act as customer service agents. By the way BT, my name is NOT Mr Paul. That's my first name.
If you recruit and use cheap labor then please educate them to the standard we require in the UK for communication purposes.
Why are BT being allowed to take over? They have now acquired EE mobile so anyone using that provider expect the same level of crap service and arrogance. Massive profits for a substandard product - woeful BT."
Mark Bailey,Carmarthen,10/28/15,"On my activation day, I had no telephone or internet service (and I had it the day before). After calling them everyday for a week, I then got the telephone working (I had been calling them via my mobile). I have been calling them almost every other day for a month, but I have had no luck getting the internet sorted. They first stated that if they are called out and the problem with the phone line is due to something I have done, they will fine me £129.99! Then they sent out two engineers (of course I had to stay home off work for these visits) who could not fix the problem. And then they just kept on saying over the phone that they will get some other engineers to go and fix the network and wiring at the cabinet on the street. They promised me (for the 5th time) that yesterday it would all be sorted. However it is not. Hence I am cancelling my contract and moving to another company! So much time wasted on these incompetent people! Also, I have waster £100 on a 3G dongle for slow internet in the mean time."
Tobias,Barnet,10/27/15,"Shocking customer service, after waiting 2 weeks for connection, wasted a day waiting for someone to connect my line but no one turned up, found out order has not been processed, told in 2 days I shall receive a phone call which never came and when I called them about it was hung up on whilst being on hold. Needed to call them multiple times to get to the bottom of the fact that I cannot get fibre broadband at my address, so just upgraded with existing service provider. Shameful, utter rubbish and wasted over a month of my time. Toby"
Theodore,Manchester,10/27/15,"BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE choosing BT. First they send my equipment to the wrong address. After calling them they say sorry (they say that a lot) we are going to send you your aeuipment again. One hour later I get a message telling me ""we are sorry that you cancelled your order, please return the equipment back to us"". Call them again and said I did not cancel anything and I don't have any equipment to return because you send it to the wrong address. They said sorry (again) ignore the message. After the engineer comes to install my phone and a couple of days later they text me that my broadband is activated. Activated but not working. After numerous phonecalls and three cancelled BT engineer appointments an engineer comes and tells me that not only I've been given a wrong phone number but a wrong broadband too. Apparently although I order and paying for Fiber broadband I didn't get one. My speeds are 1.5mbs Max! Basically my order is all screwed up. That's what happens when you speak with people in India that can barely speak any English. BT worse company in the UK. NEVER AGAIN"
Kiara,Doncaster,10/27/15,"Worst company I have ever experienced! Was due to switch from BT to TalkTalk on 9th September but BT wouldn't pass on the information they required which they have openly admitted and also said should I wish to change I would need to change my phone number. Ater numerous conversations I was told no payment would be requested from 9th-28th September and the Direct Debit was cancelled by them before 9th September. I have now been billed £148.94 plus £10.00 charge for failure of payment via Direct Debit, after they cancelled it! Customer Services staff are rude and don't pay attention to what you're saying, manager's seem to interrupt you whilst you're talking and then go quiet when you've pointed out a fact that they can't argue. Absolutely diabolicle, worst company I have EVER come into contact with, cannot wait to get rid of this terrible Broadband that hardly ever works. Definitely would not recommend for anyone to switch over to them."
David Donnelly,Tal y waun Torfaen,10/26/15,"As a customer of Talktalk, hit by a price increase and then the security scare, when I received a well judged mailshot from BT, I was tempted. I went on to their chat on line spot and told them the details of my current arrangement and asked for a quote.
The reply was that the limit of 250 characters had been exceeded, and invited me to start again.
My first reaction was annoyance that I had not been warned that there was a limit until I had painstakingly typed my request.
Then I felt relief. It all came back to me why I had left them in the first place so many years ago. it was their arrogance, treating customers as just cash cows.
So thanks BT. No saving is worth getting back into bed with you!!!y h"
Mark a,Nelson,10/26/15,"The worst company I have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with. From day one the asked us to take a day off work so they could set the new install up for us,then the hub came in a box we had to set up ourself. Not had a day with a good internet speed most below.04 of a Meg we pay for up to 17 meg and was told we should get around 7. They arranged for an engineer to come out so we booked another day off work, and no engineer turned up, called them and they said it's ok it's fixed itself. Over the next hour the Internet has cut out 4 times I've been told it's my pic tv etc that must be at fault.
When I was with virgin they set it up for us, then if there was a problem it was fixed really fast, but 6 months down the line I still have no internet have to leave the phone unplugged so the Internet works ( so the fee for the land line is a bit of a rip off also) and the outcome of every complaint is it my equipment is all broke,"
JC,Ipswich,10/25/15,"Switched from Sky as fed up of being constantly surcharged for not having a Sky box .Quite happy at the start with BT but not totally reliable constant speed drop outs but arrogant customer service with a how dare I even think about moving ! attitude.
Lots of delay tactics contact engineer contact cancellations.I got totally miffed with them so coughed up £100 early cancellation charge with all the delay tactics & unfortunately Gwyneth who got shirty with me when her every question ie ""You need to speak to faults so we can improve our service to you"" was answered every time with ""I'm not interested"" Woe betide any body speaking to them after 1800 GMT as they speak in hyroglifics through a crackly phone line. Plus they charged me £150 for a faulty socket.So farewell BT & bog off as I am off to the fur coat & no knickers operation that is Virgin Media."
Pat Lyons,South Wales,10/24/15,Ober the years Ive tried many different services and providers. I rank Talk Talk as the absolute worst. NTL put me off ever trying Virgin. The absolute vest customer service without a shadow of doubt is O2 which I have at a 2nd address. BT attracted me with the sales pitch and the free wifi but in truth its not as transparent as O2 and neither has it the support. I dont want to knock yje firm when they dont deserve it but I see little in the way of good news staying long term . I will however persevere a bit longer.
stmartinsdiver,Devon,10/24/15,First experience with BT - oh dear! After calling to find out why downloads were only running at .383Kb when the line tested at 7.9Mb I discovered that their 'BT Desktop Help' does not work with Windows 10. Love chat then took 20 minutes to connect after showing a wait time of 4 minutes and when I conversed with the agent their use of English was poor and their technical knowledge almost zero - I was even asked at one point to delete a Windows system file. A follow-up call established that they already knew about the Windows 10 issue but again the agent was difficult to understand. I was asked to reset the router with no regard to interruption to online services that were currently running - and all this on the same line that has worked without problems for 12 months with another provider using the BT infrastructure. Appalling.
UNimpressed,North Manchester,10/23/15,"Cant really comment on speed and reliability as I am trying to change from sky to bt , but they way I was treated by the customer service people I am now in two minds. The appear to thing everyone knows everything about computers ,tv`s and the packages they offer, I only wanted a bit of advice, but it may be that bt are making too much money to worry about customer satisfaction , ah well sky will be happy"
Dan,Haywards Heath,10/21/15,"Absolute rip off. Expensive for terrible internet speeds. They charged me an extra £5 without contacting me and added BT Sports onto my account, which I had to go through an hour of talking to non english people to get a refund on it!

Prices then went up without allowing me to leave my contract.

Threatened with a fee of £130 to move my internet when I rented elsewhere OR sign into another 12 month contract at a higher price.

So now I am stuck with this company for yet another year!

Stay well clear .. No value for money whatsoever."
Clemmie,Manchester,10/21/15,"My boyfriend and I just moved in to a new flat and while waiting for our BT broadband to start, we are using a BT Wifi with Fon hotspot. I have to say it's really not a good start, and I really hope the wifi we get will be better. The hotspot connection cuts about every 10 minutes, and we have to constantly reconnect to it. I work from home and need internet for my job, and this has been an absolute nightmare. Really not worth paying the £20 for 5 days, as I end up having to go out to an internet café to be able to work anyways. Really not a good connection speed or reliability."
Edward,salisbury,10/20/15,"Well where do i start, i upgraded from standard brandband to fibre and since day 1 i was only getting standard broadband speeds i contacted bt customer services and they said there was a fault in my area please wait 14 days, i phoned again after 14 days as i was still getting standard speeds of 6mb and they said the fault had been fixed and i have said it wasnt so you they said they then found another fault that will be fixed in 7 days, 7 days past my broadband speed was still 6mb instead of fibre so i phoned them again and they said it was fixed so i have now told them i am refusing to pay until it sorted and 3 months later of being haggled for a £500 bill daily by there billing team the fault team contacted me and said they have found the fault unfortunately my landline does not support fibre broadband speeds it took them 5 months to find this out? And as i was paying £79 for there biggest fibre a month i will recieve a credit on my account as i was only getting £14 a month standard broadband and they will switch me to this tariff and after 6 months off all this hassle they finally gave me a credit of the 5 months fibre which was £32!!!! How did they work this out? Absalutely terrible company i will not be using bt again and would deffinately not recommend them."
Ken Weir,Gloucester,10/19/15,"Where do I start? Firstly it would help if the staff you speak to at customer services could understand English. I spent a considerable time on the phone trying to explain to a gentleman that I was unable to access my BT mail account as it kept telling me that it didn't recognise the details. Neither could I access any BT hotspots for wifi as again it wasn't recognising my details. Lastly I explained how unhappy I was that BT had reduced my payments to such a low level that I was now in debt to them. The gentleman explained how to fix the problems with my email and BT hotspots and assured me that my direct debit would be set to the amount that I requested. Two months later.......still no access to BT hotspots, still unable to change the primary email details, still unable to get my BT mail details accepted and still paying far too little on my direct debit meaning BT are once again hicking it up to a completely unacceptable level to recoup the money I owe them.......I am NOT amused!"
Rikki,Staffs,10/19/15,"Had BT Infinity 2 for the last year and haven't had any problems. My installation was a different matter and after moving house, took almost 2 months to get a working installation. I found the Mumbai call centre to be useless and they were the first to ever be shouted expletives at! I found that complaining on the BT Facebook page is your best bet. Fill in the page you are given a link to and the brilliant team in Northern Ireland will help to get you a decent service. They even phone you at convenient times and deal with you like a human being. In short my service has been amazing ever since. The BT bill is large but you get what you pay for I suppose!"
max,London,10/19/15,"I have tried and ordered a BT package with line and internet.with a visit from an engeeneer betwin 8-1p.m.
I was stressing if it was possible to get at early as possible as i had to somewhere else by 1.
Guess what never bothered to turn up or contact me.
Customer service (I believe in India)useless.
I thought for a premium service that you pay you do get it.
Unfortunately just expensive with no service.
Done with BT.
Get a cheaper one for same or better service."
Dave A,Moreton In Marsh,10/19/15,BT Broadband is totally useless !! It's a COMPLETE RIPOFF !! Useless Technical Support. I have had 3 BT HUBS & none of them have worked properly. I have had ENDLESS MISERY for the last 14 Months. My last BT Bill was £48.23 which is totally extortionate !!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE !!! I am in the process of switching my ISP & telephone to one that is much cheaper and extremely more reliable !! BT IS ONE TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!! Dave A
ian howse,pontefract,10/17/15,BT have been superb over the past 18 months. Customer service and product has been second to none. Getting 36mbps. On fibre and the connection hasn't dropped once. Better than Sky and EE broadband.
Ja,Rh106hl,10/17/15,"Had bt fibre for 4 years, no throttling, get speed as quoted, no downtime just a shame I subsidising the premier league."
C May,Wales,10/16/15,Bt is a terrible internet provider. It's okay when it's working but when it's not it can take upwards of 3 weeks for someone to even consider fixing it. If you call them you get through to someone in India who often cannot tell you the problem or lies to you. It's the worst internet provider available
Wright,Southport,10/16/15,"We have had nothing but trouble BT Broadband and Phone. We have it in our holiday home and every time we come there is a fault. In July when we came we had been disconnected for no other reason than to put a new line for the van next door. Over three weeks it took them to put the line back on, by which time we had to leave. We came back this week and there is still a fault, we are having to use the hotspot. Every time we phone it takes a week for them to respond. We had a bad response from customer complaints it took over a month on the phone before we could get any compensation for loss of use. Can't wait till Christmas for the contract to run out and try some other company. If we could score zero stars thats what they would get from us.

Alan,West Wales,10/15/15,"If things are going well it's OK..BUT when things go wrong you've got a problem! On the technical side the Indians can only sort things up to a certain level but they don't know that,keep plugging away and get frustrated...and so do you! On plans and billing if there's a mistake the call centre staff can't get their head round the complexities of the plans. I signed up for a BT Sport plan avoiding the £5 charge by signing up for an additional 12 months. I was then sent a letter to say I would be charged. Phoned and told I was definitely on the 'no play' plan. Bill arrived,I had been charged. Phoned again, was told it would be rectified- it wasn't. Phoned again-told it would be rectified -we'll see! Call centre staff are lovely but they can't understand and/or rectify the errors."
Ed,Minehead,10/15/15,"Being charged for Engineer call from my line. Yes, really!
Shockingly bad. No broadband available from my line and no refund for line rentals. Broadband fault booked 4 times. First engineer no show. second engineer was a line engineer altho a broadband fault, could do nothing. third engineer the same. Forth Engineer was a broadand engineer and confirmed that no broadband available as too far from exchange. Whole thing took over 2 months to resolve. BT are refusing to honor promise to refund line rental as they say the line was used to make a call. The paper bill requested arrived this morning and I've been charged for the engineers call to BT's automated line test center in Derby. 50 seconds, 27p the number is 01332758773. And on that basis a refund has been refused. Have you been charged for an engineers call. Check your bill! Got broadband via a mobile device from a well known mobile company. THE SAME DAY! It works too."
E G,london,10/15/15,"Still confused as to how these guys have any customers at all. I have the misfortune of dealing with BT professionally and personally. Both experiences equally tragic. They are 100% incompetent, they lie and the customer service provided is not only Pharisaical but quite stressful and a complete waste of time. The speed is rubbish, often dropping and very very slow. It took them 3 weeks to take the line over from EE when we switched in our home, An engineer failed to show twice and in total we were without internet for 6 weeks and the hours spent on the phone makes me feel so angry.the converstaion during which i finally told them to cancel the contract took 1 hour and 13 minutes. eventually when we cancelled altogether after weeks of lies and no shows sky had internet sorted within the week. Shocking, below sub standard joke of a company. Id advise anyone thinking of using them to steer clear and well clear!"
Ben Moser,Knutsford,10/14/15,THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN GET 1 STAR! BT are pathetic they have given us just problems since we bought their services. We have no wifi so my son cannot complete his GCSE'S. BT took down any wifi we had! Our 3G bill is through the roof! We have no way of receiving any information via the internet. The contact service was useless none of them knew what they were doing and we couldn't understand them! Very angry strongly recommend you don't go with this service.
howard grey,middle brampton villa,10/13/15,Speed dreadful a dial up service could not be slower
Luca,Manchester,10/13/15,
Crockadial,Surrey,10/13/15,"I tried to get Broadband through BT, firstly infinity to premises and then ordinary broadband. Infinity was sold to me and promised to be as quick and easy as copper line bb. I waited 3 weeks for an engineer, he turned up and said the road was too dangerous to work on, and they would require traffic management. Was advised by BT to cancel original order and to get a copper line telephone and bb installed. Promised it would be done on the 24th September. No engineer turned up, when l called BT to ask what had happened they said the order has problems with the exchange. After weeks of endless calls to and from BT and going round and round in circles with no answers from BT, l have now cancelled the order and am hoping another provider will be able to supply us with BB. BT is an unhelpful and useless company selling products they can not provide. l would NOT recommend this company to anyone."
wayne,chorley,10/12/15,"here goes,24 july moved to new address.No phone line till 20 August,No broadband till 1st september.BT wanted a bill for £107 ! still trying to work out why.Broadband speed less than 1 meg,(this is on infinity 1) to this day still not right.Over 30 phone calls to india i might as well phone saturn have more chance of getting anything done.Call centres a complete waste of time,they do not talk to each other,i have to relive the nightmare over and over everytime i ring.Groundhog day!.I have a solution to the problem ,i think i will take a 3year telecoms course,and at the end of it try and fix my own broadband.please please please do not get your broadband off BT you WILL live to regret it.Bring back dial -up its quicker than BT."
Sarah,Bordon,10/12/15,"Absolutely appalling service. Ordered a new phone line and broadband infinity for a house move and it all went wrong from there. Incorrect order placed on their end, 15 hours + on the phone trying to resolve the issue. Inability to speak to the same person twice, each person giving me different versions of the truth, temporary broadband premium at the old address given for '4 weeks' until the move - had it for a week and now being charged £860 for 'cancelling the order early' even though we never ordered it and are being accused of agreeing to pay for a two year broadband contract in two houses, one of which we left two months ago. Being given false information about the cloud and expecting more 'cancellation charges' while trying to sort it. Over 2 hours on the phone again today with a woman from India who made me spell Sarah 3 times and refuses to allow the charges to be dropped, insisting that we were more than willing to pay 2 years of broadband for 4 (1) week(s) worth. And that's is cutting the story short. Absolutely appalled by the despicable service of everyone at bt. Not a single person I spoke to appears to know what their job is. My advice is to avoid Bt like the plague. They have the worst customer service skills and common sense that I have ever had the displeasure to deal with."
Sophie,Hearne,10/10/15,"Please don't waste your time with BT. It has been 2 1/2 months since we ordered broadband. I have had to chase them at every point. You repeat your story over and over, and no one has the authority to do anything, but pass you on to the next department. They are full of empty promises. CHECK YOUR BILLS! They most likely have billed you for everything that they so kindly said they would minus off."
fuming frog,Worksop,10/10/15,"my phone line and broadband were supposed to go live on 08/10.it did not happen. The phone is dead and the broadband keeps dropping. I called on 09/10 and was told there was a problem with the previous supplier not ""releasing"" my phone number but that it would be fixed by midnight that day. It still does not work. So, I called their helpline and after talking to an advisor for quite some time and being told to plug and unplug things, it was still the same. Then he said he could send an engineer but it might cost me £129 pounds if something was wrong with my equipment. This worked perfectly 3 days ago with the other provider, so, I don't think so. I said no thanks and put the phone down as he was not easy to understand. I then went on their chat line, and halfway through the conversation, got disconnected. i tried again and was told that there was already an ""expert"" working on it and also an engineer booked to come to my house. I never agreed to that. any way was there an expert working on it or was it an engineer coming to me??
I then said I wanted to leave BT, and he asked if he could call me. Of course he must have tried to call my landline because a few minutes later he asked, on the chat line, if I had another phone number!!
He called and transferred me to someone else! This person went through the same rubbish all over again, so I said I wanted to leave BT, got transferred to another person who said I would have to pay £500+ cancellation fee although since being with them I have had no working phone and appalling broadband. But if I leave now, I'm in breach of contract! what about them being in breach of contract by not providing what I'm paying for!
I then had to agree to an engineer coming to my house but not till the 14th. I told this advisor that I needed my phone as I am an OAP and expecting rather important calls from my solicitor. My mobile is not brilliant, and I told him so, so, he tried to sell me a £6 a month SIM card from BT!!! How would that make my mobile better?
It also seems to be that only if I am without service for 10 days will I get any refund on my subscription. That's a bit rich considering I have had no service on the phone line from the start!"
Matthew Kirby,Surrey,10/9/15,"After 2 years of Infinity where the speed has dropped from 15 to 8mb, just got some brilliant news! 4G has arrived, 55mb down, 25 up. Shiny new 4g router works a treat. Soon all those dodgy cables will be melted down and those 'engineers' can get jobs in B&Q. Welcome to the future. Kiss goodbye to those jokers. I won't use EE or plus net either as owned by BT."
M,london,10/9/15,Complete joke Moving to virgin.
Lizzie,Southsea,10/8/15,"I live in a well connected city and gave BT the benefit of doubt thanks to their new marketing. Having joined in May, by August they had still not provided the broadband I had been paying for. After many lengthy phone calls and empty promises assuring me it would be fixed, I finally cancelled (or believed I had!). Two months later they are still stealing money from my account for Services that I have never received.
Hearing myself up for another lengthy phone all to a foreign call centre.... What ever you do...don't do it!! Talk talk provided the service (as paid for!!) fully fitted and running within a week for less money :)"
Chetana,Southampton,10/7/15,"I can't comment on customer service as in 4 years, I have never, ever had to call them. The broadband has never been slow despite servicing a smart TV, 2 smart phone, 3 computers and a kindle. It's never gone off-line ever. Wish it was a bit cheaper though!"
Nicola higgs,Gloucester,10/7/15,
Martin,Near Chippenham,10/6/15,"Outstandingly bad overall. Poor broadband speeds, poor customer service. Fluctuating problems and cynical responses to complaints. Numerous 'fixes' for slow speeds but after a few weeks they just go down again.Email hopelessly unreliable - tried 67 times today to get to log in page, then was disconnected 9 times by error message claiming I had asked to 'send another form' when I had done nothing but try to use the service. No attempt ever to tell customers if there is a known fault. No compensation. BT is due for a big scandal, surely. Eventually arrogance does not pay."
Bell,Yorkshire,10/6/15,"Changed to BT in May 2015 and was assured by BT Infinity Hub 5 was the best, total rubbish When on the internet my connection will just cut off for no reason, might only be for a short while but annoying when you trying to find someone. I have a brand new laptop so it cannot be the age of the equipment. I did contact customer services and they said no problem we can sort it out we can alter the speed for you and they then reeled off load of IT speak and said, yes now that is better, and it worked fine for about a week and now it is just as bad as ever. I did ask why wasn't I given the higher speed at the start as I was playing for it, they could not answer that.Have no intentions of ringing again because you have to speak to someone in India who is totally useless and they are allowed to give you the company speak. Sorry I ever decided to go with BT. Why are they allowed to get away with bad service."
Malcolm New,Wales,10/5/15,"Had a poor experience today.. In July my 82 year old mother wished to upgrade her internet to ""unlimited"", sadly she mistakenly updated (by phone) to ""unlimited Infinity 1 broadband"", which she definitely did not require since standard broadband speeds are fine where she lives in the south east of England. A friendly call to BT today to explain the honest mistake essentially fell on deaf ears since the contract ""14 day cool off"" period had expired. There is some dispute if my mother had received the confirmatory email from BT at the time, where we might have been able to rectify the mistake in time. As a result my mother is locked in to an 18th month contract and paying around £130 extra than she needed to over that period. BT tried to convince me to accept that the dispute was ""resolved""... which it certainly is not..I may or may not take this further with the ombudsman. The take home message is ...Technical aspects of computers can be rather confusing to some, I personally will be paying more attention to my mother's internet contracts in future.. I am with BT as well and have generally been happy with their service until now.. However because of their intransigence today I intend to take advantage of current offers from other providers ASAP...so they will lose me as a customer for a while.. what a shame you could not be more reasonable and flexible BT.. hence a poor rating from me."
Kevin,Kent,10/4/15,"I joined BT for the BT Sport.My phone line crackled, I had to buy a 15m ethernet cable as the Line Extenders did not work.I spent an hour on the phone to Calcutta only to be told the broadband was slow.Even with a Cat 6 cable the broadband was only 6 meg and the BT Sport was unreliable. Simply do not bother with Line Extenders buy a cable! I wanted Sky Sports but was told I had to upgrade to Infinity to get it for even more money. I posted everything back within the 14 days ans good job I had proof of posting as they kept saying they had not received it even though I had a tracking number saying it was delivered. Even though I only had the service 14 days I got a final bill for £136. I contested it and it was reduced to £106 then £58. Frankly I should be paying nothing for a dodgy phoneline I never used,Interner a third of the speed promised and TV that barely worked even though I bought my own cable. I have gone back to Virgin as they are far better."
crimblestcock,Cornwall,10/3/15,"Dont trust BT ever. I contacted BT in 2013 when the exchange showed it was AO (accepting orders) here i am oct 2015 and still no Superfast. I have a case open with their own complaints and Ombudsman. I lost out on free internet deals on the promises and order i put with BT from other suppliers. They continually LIE and blame sub contractors for their own engineering g incompetence. A neighbour who placed. an order in August had his installed within 3 weeks..BT was given £90,000,000of tax payer money to ensure rural broad band roll out.. . I don't recommend them to anyone ever."
crobertson,lancashire,10/3/15,"For the past 3 weeks I have had problems with my bt broadband dropping out. It had completely gone for a week. On calling BT on 15/10/15 I was told there was no problem with my line. I called back 10 minutes later when the broadband went done again, and spoke to an alternative advisor, who told me there was a deep problem with my line, and that an engineer would come out the following Monday. Having taken the morning off work and waited in from 8am to 1pm for my engineer visit, I then called BT to ask where the engineer was. It took me 40 minutes to connect to an advisor who told me there was no problem with my line and the engineer didn't need to visit. Wonderful that they didn't let me know that before I stayed in all morning. Only the problem has not been fixed. Having waited an hour to be put through to another advisor, who told me that a technical expert would be in contact in 48 hours. I have now received after 44 hours an email to tell me to check my connections and offering a paid for technical advise service - so far have spent about 2 and a half hours on hold, been passed from department to department, and still have broadband that cuts out. Having asked their complaint procedure I was told I would receive an email detailing how to complain - surprisingly it did not arrive. I cannot wait until my contract finishes, as I will under no circumstances renew with BT. Customer service is absolutely dismal and dealing with their advisors is frustrating and useless. Perhaps if I stop paying my bill, someone will contact me."
Joshua Colletta,"Newmarket, Suffolk",10/2/15,"Advertised as 17Mb, receive between 3 and 0.3. Comes and goes rapidly and unexpectedly. Phone up customer service? as soon as they realise that there is actually a problem with your line and you need help they hang up."
Nina Keay,SW London,10/2/15,"My bt broadband has been so entirely unreliable that I cancelled it in favour of Virgin connection in mid October. About fifteen days into my September bt monthly allowance I had received a message to say that I had used 80% of that allowance. Broadband was unavailable for hours and sometimes days at a time. The following day I received another message to say that I had used 100% of my September allowance. Today I received an email to say that I had used 60% of my September allowance. I should say I only use broadband for emails, occasional banking and looking up facts on the internet. About fifteen minutes a day - nothing at all for the long, long periods when the middle light on the router is flashing."
Jason,West Yorkshire,10/2/15,"I had an issue with BT several years ago where they tried to charge me £180 for ending my contract early. I eventually proved them wrong and had the charge overturned. After this episode I decided I would never return to BT. However, given the offers for new members that were available last year I decided to give them another go. After experiecing very poor broadband speeds I have started to shop around for new fibre optic offers as my contract is due to end in a months time. BT are the most expensive provider out there! The most difficult part is trying to cancel your contract. I have called several times recently to discuss the cancellation and not until the third call did someone advise me that if I left before the contract end date I would be liable to pay them over £88 for cancellation fees. I have called today to give them my 30 day notice (as requested to do so) but was told not to and just arrange the switch over with another provider. Avoid if you can, really not worth the hassle when you come to renew contracts and there is far better price plans out there."
Bryan Cadman,North Somerset,10/2/15,
Marknally,Kent,10/1/15,"Well my experience with BT has been very poor. I've currently had a fault on my fibre line for 3 months and after dealing with quite frankly appalling customer services for approximately 2 months I have recently been dealing with a digital care case manager whose latest reply to me told me that they do not compensate, so effectively I've been locked into a contract paying each month for a substandard service. They've now been reported to ofcom who are now investigating my complaints. I would and will now be advising everyone I speak to that the should avoid BT."

David frost,Bodmin cornwall,9/28/15,"What a disorganised, disfunctional,and arrogant organisation. Signed up with bt for tel line ,infinity broadband and bt tv on the 24th august for new property we wre moving into on 18th sept Promised a vist on 14th& 21st sept to have all installed, noticed on tracking my order on the 18th to see that 21st visit had been cancelled without any notification from them. told unable to do outside work rebooked for 30th sept and 6th oct. Low and behold next day an engineer was outside doing the work. Looked at my order tracking and 21st visit was reinstated. But on the 20th day after the first visit an engineer knocked and said he was there for outside work! explained it was all done but needed the inside work done. He could not do that and left. took a day off work to there on 21st and guess what no engineer turnerd up. Rang customer service and told work wont be done now to 9th october. What a waste of time and effort. They never contact you give a load of spiel. and no help what soever. sent an email of complaint but never got a reply. Wished we stayed with sky. and i thought they had bad customer service.
BT STOP SPENDING VAST AMOUNTS ON FOOTBALL AND ADVERISING AND GET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER AND WORK TO KEEP CUSTOMERS"
Robert,Greenwich,9/26/15,"NEVER AGAIN BT !!
I had no problem for 2.5 years with TalkTalk and then Plusnet broadband. But after less than a month with BT broadband, our service went down for almost 3 weeks.
Needless to say this was a big inconvenience and also meant we could not watch the BT Sport channels we had subscribed to. To make matters worse we were told we would receive a refund for the period we had no service, but once it was fixed BT said we would actually receive no refund at all!"
Guy Boxall,Sussex,9/25/15,"When it works very good, and reliable, but a telecoms company their telephone service is appalling. I have spent hours on the phone trying to resolve slow broadband on Infinity One Hub5. Now looking elsewhere."
Ruby ALi,Bedfordshire,9/25/15,"Overall experience horrible, wouldn't recommended b.t to any one customer service is non existent just a nasty horrible company that likes taking money from sick individuals that already are suffering from life threatening disease and b.t just makes it worse by taking money from them that their don't have also their have un professional people that have no training or skills working for them who don't know how to talk to customers treat you like your nothing so rude apparently their don't have management working on weekends and if you do wish to complain you'll be waiting hours and hours disgusting that's all I can say don't join b.t you'll regret just like I do."
Martin,Merseyside,9/25/15,
Ayesha Corrins,Aberdeen,9/24/15,"Worst customer service I have EVER came across
I moved house 8 days ago. Changed my details online 8 days ago. Called then 7 days ago to query why my broadband wasn't working. The details werent changed on their computer. I changed them over the phone. It still didn't work. I called the next day. Details STILL weren't changed. I changed them AGAIN over the phone. Still not working. The following day I was assured repeatedly that my details had been changed and that my broadband would be working by midnight. Shock horror the following morning it still wasn't working. I called back, was told there was nothing wrong their end. That I had to call back when I was at home and someone from the technical dept would assist me. I called back yesterday. Apparently it WAS their problem....that they were having ""technical issues"". But I was assured my broadband d would be up and running by midnight. Would you believe...I woke this morning and it's STILL not working. I called AGAIN at 8am today, to be told my details hadn't been changed! After an hour on the phone, being passed from advisor to advisor (most of which couldn't understand a word I was saying!), I was assured yet again that my broadband would be working by midnight, she even had to the cheek to say ""you can trust me"". Pfft. It's now half past midnight and surprise surprise it's STILL NOT WORKING!! After countless amounts of phone calls....each time speaking to at least 4 diff advisors. I can safely say I am sick to the back teeth with bt. They are the worst customer advisors I have EVER had to deal with"
Christine,Worthing,9/24/15,"Absolutely appalling speed and intermittent wifi connection. Customer service after numerous calls of resetting etc still couldn't do help and told me my infinity contact which h
I pay top whack for does not guarantee a wifi service, only high speed for ethernet connection. So pointless buying modern technology like ipads!!! They say there is nothing I can do as I'm stuck in a contract and apparently it's in the small print!!! I asked to speak to a supervisior but surprise surprise not one available on his shift. Steer clear people!!!!!"
Danny,Essex,9/24/15,"Absolute crap, have to reset my hub minimum 3 times a week. I have the so called fastest infinity, takes an infinity more like to get going and onto websites. Costs too much for such a under mediocre speed and service. internet loses connection at important times frequently, can never even write and email without having to draft it during writing as internet will cut out again. BT, spend money on improving the service for your existing customers, don't just concentrate on signing new ones up. Once signed up, when we realise what a terrible service you give us, we can complain, don't you realise this when trying to sign up new customers. I am glad that now after complaining to you I can soon dump you for a more reliable provider. What a sigh of relief when this came in, no more having to honour long drawn out contracts and bad service. As for your customer service...you only get to speak to British when you complain and threaten to leave....pathetic! The only time you care is when you will lose money. Seriously, for anybody looking for a reliable broadband provider, that gives value for money and genuinely cares for it's existing customers...look elsewhere, BT think they can live on past reputations when they was just about the only provider dealing in telecommunications...times change, just like my broadband provider soon will be!"
Boris,Northants,9/23/15,"Got Fibre Optic a year ago. worked straight off at 80mbps+
Now slowed right down to 45mbps
contacted BT and after several checks identified my line has been turned down to 45mbps
When I asked why I was told it was due to my previous issues (I'd had none) and that an engineer would go to my local exchange and tuned it back up, they haven't (no surprise)
Now I know 45mbps isn't really slow, but I checked with BT before buying that I would get 80+ and did for a year.
They still say 80+ is available and my neighbour get it, so I'm left paying for something I'm not getting.

Out of interest if you go to http://speedtest.btwholesale.com

then run a speed test you will see the speed your getting.

Once you've done that select further diagnostics

enter your broadband related phone number and run diagnostics test

The result will display the speed available on your connection.

Its less than when you first had the service then its a BT issue. Don't be fobbed off by BT telling you its not down to them.

It may be that they've turned it down for existing customers because the exchange is struggling, thats simply not your issue and you should get what you signed up for and are paying for."
Julia,,9/21/15,"I'm incredibly disappointed. Especially that I feel I have no other way but to find every review site to express this. We have had a home hub 5, which they have advised was faulty so sent us a new one. In which we installed this evening and guess what not working. So at 7pm we called BT with the hope they could resolve it. So the current time is now 10.02pm. Still no resolution. They tried to advise us that there was a problem with our devises and not with BT. In which as you can imagine didn't not go down well. The next thing was we can offer you a chargeable service. Why would we pay extra when you can't get something correct for what we do pay for now! We have now been left for another day so in total no internet for 5 days. So work is now on the back burner due to poor BT service. I do hope they sort it out as we have adviser we will allow them the 24 hours they have requested. Please re-think if you think BT is the way forward."
Rachel,lancashire,9/21/15,"Absolutely disgusting service, ordered BT services & infinity broadband full package & we have been waiting 4 weeks for installation & activation...we've been passed from pillar to post every time we ring up & all in all lied to every time. Engineer came on Saturday & even he himself said how bad it was...still waiting for broadband activation which should have been up and running a week ago, they have now informed me that it will be another 2 weeks before that happens!!! This is falsely advertised & marketed & BT as a company are nothing but scammers in my opinion. Customer service operatives have hung the phone up on 3 occasions.... Surely they should be answerable to trading standards....."
Malcolm,glasgow,9/21/15,Have been with bt for over 25 years but now find their customer care is very poor from there call centres to there automatic phone service which can take ages to connect you to another automatic menu in the last few weeks I have spent over 7 hours in total regarding an over high bill to the extent I have cancelled my contract with . The even have the cheek to charge a disconnection charge even after the 21 days notice wouldn't recommend there service in future
Nina Keay,S.W. London,9/20/15,"I'd have given no stars if possible. For six months I have had little or no internet service. I have spent hours on the 'phone to them, gone through all the tests they asked me to do at home and still no broadband. They sent me new ADSL filters. They had no effect. BT told me that if they sent an engineer and it was some fault in the house I'd be charged for the engineer's visit. I wouldn't know. Most days I only have internet for an hour in the morning or late at night. After being with BT since they started I finally had to admit defeat and defect to Virgin. I have just received an email from them telling me that as I'm leaving them they're going to charge me for discontinuing my broadband connection!!! It's been mostly discontinued for six months. As I have no computer broadband connection I've maxed out my mobile internet allowance - result I have absolutely NO broadband connection while paying for both computer AND mobile. To say I'm hacked off would be an understatement."
Colin B,Cheltenham,9/18/15,"I had been with plusnet for a year and had No issues at all. Probably only really needed to restart my router about 3 times in a year.

With BT now for a month, as I wanted to get bt sport.the internet is terrible. I used tobe able to get a potential speed of 16ms/s and now I am downloading a file which is 424mb and it says it will take 6 hours! I restated my router and still the same. Very poor"
Hate to complain but,Brixton London,9/18/15,"I foolishly turned down a great deal with Virgin to pay a little less for BT infinity and BT sport.

Wow, how stupid of me. Should I really have expected a decent service? After all, this lot pay Michael Owen money to actually talk about football, a perfect reflection of how much they know about technical details and customer service. In fact am more annoyed with myself, believing this BS sorry I mean BT.

You get what you pay for. My advice, go Virgin and reluctantly pay extra for Michael Owen and BT to ruin the beautiful game further.

Oh and don't believe when they say, your complaint has been lodged, they'll call you on a certain date. There's more likely hood in Michael and Co blurting out something insightful.

Sky and Virgin may be over priced, but at least they bring some level of British class, whether that be programming or quality in service.

BT, you're like Nokia. By the time you realised how far you got left behind by competitors. You'll always be two steps behind and hated by those who give you a second chance.

Time to remove the 'B' from BT. They have nothing that makes us feel proud. Sir Richard, forgive me. I'll be back asap."
Danny,London,9/17/15,"As typical of other reviewers, BT customer services is very poor indeed. Multiple calls, failure to listen, failure to update notes, failure to take action, failure to respond to complaints.

Shame, because my experience of the broadband service itself was fine. Pity for BT they are now losing me as a customer simply because of their customer service operation"
Tamara Rynne,Leeds,9/16/15,"We went with BT because it was advertised so well, however they sent us the wrong cable to connect our internet with, then they charged us £130 to rectify the mistake that they made in the first place! We are absolutely appalled with the service and will do our best to tell anyone who will listen never to go to BT again"
Philgo,Middleton,9/15/15,"I have had this so called Internet Phone and TV Package for one month of constant hassle unreliable poor quality TV Phone service which sometimes take up to nine attempts to get through. You dial the number and the line goes dead, and occasionally you do get through on the first attempt, this is when the phone is connected directly to the BT test socket. The phone line has been checked over six times and according to BT its working perfect. The Broadband speed is between 74 and 79 Meg but this is not all that important when its continually dropping connection as I discovered when I examined the Home Hub 5 Logs. This is probably the reason for slow scrolling of web pages and the appalling TV service on my You view box + when watching internet streaming channels. The You view + box isn't much better on free view either even though all the TV's in my house work without a problem. The main TV is fed from the aerial output of the You view box and work perfectly. BT Residential are a backstreet technically incompetent bunch on con merchants who tell lies and they will never provide the service they promised you.You are paying for just an unworkable system. Do Not expect to cancel your contract early because it is not possible, even though the service does not work. I was asked to pay over £500 to terminate my contract. WISH I HAD STAYED WITH VIRGIN MEDIA, the maybe not as cheap but the system you pay for does work 100% reliable for me for the last 12 years. I am being connected to Virgin on Wednesday just so I can have a reliable Broadband Service. I will just cancel BT at the end of my contract and switch the rest of my services back to VIRGIN MEDIA.
WARNING TO ALL POTENTIAL BT CUSTOMERS DONOT BE FOOLED STAY AWAY.

ONE VERY UNHAPPY BT CUSTOMER"
tony smith,jarrow,9/14/15,Well i reported problem 3 days ago and still wiating on it being repaired its been such a inconvenience ti me carnt live with it anymore looking to change provider as b.t dont treat there customers right
Alex,Hitchin,9/14/15,The worst customer care ever!
Gareth,Farnborough,9/14/15,"I've been a bt customer for over 3 years. I pay my bill online ever month with no issue. However due to the fact I don't pay by direct debit they decided to cut me off in July 2015. So I phoned the bt number and got put through to an automated service line that kept telling me that ( your service has been restricted because you have not payed your bill) every time I selected discuss my bill it just reported ( your service has a restricted because you have not paid your bill ) aaarrrrr in the end I had to say the customer had died to be able to speak to some one about my bill. ( disgrace )
Finally I spoke to a guy from cts and he was so rude and wouldn't let me talk. He constantly spoke over me. I said to him that I've been a customer for over 3 years and I've always payed my bill every month. He didn't even care. So I asked to cancel my phone line immediately, he said that's no problem I can do that but you will receive a £30 cut off bill and a £42 30 day notice period plus a £10 late payment fee and the month that you in arrears and also the next months bill also.
£48 bt monthly bt bill x2
£30 cut off fee
£30 30 day notice fee
£10 pound late charge fee

Total £166.00
Then he asked how would I like to make payment. I just laughed at him. I started to question if I was actually calling The right number for bt. I just can't believe what had just happend. I did say that I'm not in a contact and he said it doesn't matter. I asked to speak to a manager and he replied, the manager will only say the same thing. I just put the phone down. I'm so upset that I've been treated like this. I just want others to realise what these dirty cheats are like. I can't stop any one from going to bt but please make sure you're happy with the service you got. On the plus side, I have my own company and I have to pay a lot of money for my Business line. £xxxx. It renews at the end of October this year. Can't wait to cancel this and see what service they try to offer me then. Thanks Bt for you customer service."
Michael S,Lancaster,9/14/15,"Just moved into a brand new house and unfortunately have BT ""Fibre to the Home"" installed. This means I can only go with BT
BT is a much higher cost than their competitors but also not geared up to support ""Fibre to the home"". When you have a query you get passed from one person to the next with the ""Fibre to the home is not my job, try someone else"".
Speed is extremely poor ... I get less than 10mb speed which is worse than the landline-based broadband at my old house
Cost is high and the cheapest option limits you to 20gb upload/download per month (no carry forward of unused broadband) ... however the monitoring by BT is extremely inaccurate and you can use 1gb simply accessing bbc.co.uk/news
Overall it makes for an unusable & expensive service.
Somehow I need to find a way to switch to a more ethical broadband supplier"
Ellie,Milton Keynes,9/14/15,"Absolut disgrace, after being kept on hold for 3 hours for someone to come and fix my BT hub no one turned up the next day. Changing services i was charged money i was told would be refunded after waiting 3 months for an answer!!. Customer service was next to none and i will not be using BT again. Complete rip off for a crap service…stay well clear!!"
Eamonn Carter,Northampton,9/13/15,"Been with BT since 96 am now looking for a new provider after 2 weeks of arguing.If you have slow broadband and they want you to put your computer in safe mode DONT It gives a false high speed,and then they have satisfied the legislation they sighed up for,and all your rights have gone.They caught me with thisTwo of their engineers computers gave readings of 0.5 meg my two computers gave about the same,took the sky box off and the tablet,turned off the phones and put it in safe mode as I was told to by bt reading shot up to 3.1 for one test.Thats it you dont't get any more help.Have opened a Ofcom dispute."
Sherlockflo,Brighton,9/11/15,
BD,South Wales,9/9/15,"TERRIBLE. The worst wifi, the worst service, and the most frustrating thing. I can sit approximately 5 cm away from my 3rd router sent to 'fix the problem' and I can't load a web page. Constant drop outs, no interest in helping, spoke to a UK manager after hours of being on the phone to India multiple times and she was probably the most rude and unhelpful person on the planet. I feel sorry for anyone tied into a contract and have had the displeasure of dealing with BT, they won't help, they will just charge you over £200 to leave the contract and then continue to mis-sell you products at an extortionate price after a few months. STAY AWAY"
Anon,Dorset,9/9/15,"Quite literally the worst customer service I have ever received. We started receiving huge bills (£150). Tried to cancel. Confusion over previous account holders, who is liable, charged obscene amounts until we cancelled the direct debit,as they wouldn't let us cancel or vary the contract as we weren't the account holders, although we had been paying the bills for 2 years (although it had been changed,but they claimed only to an ""online account"" holder not the account holder which even they got confused over on the calls) spent countless of hours on the phone, emailing, all for them to say they had done nothing wrong and to cut us off without any notice. This took 3.5 months.Poor communication, conflicting advice. Literally,morons who dared to be condescending towards us when we pointed out the endless string of flaws and logical inconsistencies with their argument( like writing a letter to the ""account holder' at an address they had not lived at for 2 years years telling them they were going to cancel).They told us from the outset that they could not vary the account holder's name, yet somehow have magically 3.5 months later transferred it in to my partner's name without her permission?!So what we wanted at day 1 to resolve the issue took 3.5 months and allowed them to rack up charges which although they have said we are not liable for, have failed to confirm in writing. We have no idea where we stand. My cat with a headset could have made a better go of it. I will never use BT or their services in any way ever again. We will be referring to the Ombudsman, which they said we couldn't do (wrong again) as it still isn't formally resolved and now they just ignore us. Don't waste your time trying to resolve it with them. Cancel the direct debit, protect your funds and make them come to you. Anyone from BT reading this, look down the list. I'm not even remotely exaggerating about how bad our experience has been, and I doubt anyone else is. Good luck to you BT, you'll need it."
Philip Johnson,London,9/9/15,"BT is an absolute disgrace. I informed them about moving house 2 weeks in advance and 4weeks after having moved I am still waiting for my connection to be activated. They have made me wait half a day for an engineer twice. The appointments were not cancelled, BT simply didn't show up. I would strongly recommend to stay away from them !"
Richa,,9/9/15,"In my opinion you are better off going elsewhere.
I signed up to BT on the 18th August. After 2 engineers visits I am still waiting for my broadband to work,latest estimate is 11th September. The customer service is terrible and just read from scripts rather than actually helping."
L,Orkney,9/8/15,"I wish I was able to give zero stars to this awful company. We're curently waiting for our 3rd connection appointment as their engineer missed the first 2. They didn't even bother phoning to inform us they wouldn't be turning up. People have to take time off work to meet these appointments, how can BT think it's ok to have such blatant disregard for peoples time? I've not even been offered an apology. AWFUL."
Sam,Woking,9/7/15,"Two no shows of a technician after taking days off work. I was then told a technician would arrive at 1700 tonight so I could go to work, lies. I received a call at 1330 to say a technician was at my house. I then had to look like a liar at work and rush off as I was terrified that I would be put back to the back of the pile for another fictitious appointment. All installed now to find the Woking areas broadband has been down for days. What a way to treat new business. Lies and arrogance."
Mr Grumpy,Cornwall,9/7/15,"Appalling service all round. I ordered fibre broadband 5 months ago. I now have a phone line with no broadband (which I do not want and am being charged for as it is a prerequisite for fibre) and have just been told that it will be mid-October before I even get an update, let alone the service."
Paul Blay,Milton Keynes,9/6/15,"Will never be going back to BT after they recently raised our line rental and fibre prices one month after signing up to a 12 month contract. Completely inflexible and charging new customers less than we are currently being charged even before the price hike. We will be leaving after having tried in vein to reason with several customer service reps.
We've taken advantage of Ofcoms ruling that you can leave a fixed term telecoms contract within 30 days of an announced price hike and without penalty. We'll be taking our £130 topcashback payment from BT for singing up and we'll never be back. Thanks!"
Michael Garland,Clacton-on-Sea,9/4/15,May I advise anyone unfortunate enough to subscribe to BT Broadband to check their phone bills. BT continued to charge me £3.72 per month for BB Talk Evening and Weekend Plan for months after the BB Talk service was discontinued.

Linesh,RUGBY,9/3/15,"For all those people who are considering switching to BT for broadband, please do not go by the carrots of Sainsbury vouchers and free n number of months offer. BT is truly one of the worst broadband providers in the UK. I switched from Virgin only because they did not have services in my area. I took BT infinity 9 months back and I had to get on the phone to their terrible customer service very often. I guarantee that you will spend at least an hour repeating the same answers again and again to mutliple representatives sitting in India. 45 days ago, I ordered a home move and now its been 22 days(and counting) since I moved into the house and after 3 engineer visit, no home-line/equipment fault, I am still without broadband. I have been hit with 2 ODs in my bank account(as I could not transfer money to that account due to non availability of broadband) and lots of other losses. I have spent on an average 45 minutes per day on phone to the terrible BT customer care in India and every day they recite the same story""There is an exchange fault and we are resolving that"". I am so frustrated that I have started telling everybody I know, not to take BT broadband. Go for virgin or SKY they are the best. Please please stay away from BT."
Simon,Bilston,9/2/15,"Promised I could receive speeds of up to 75mbps when signed up 6 months ago. Reported a fault on the line because of slow speed. Engineer told me I could only receive speeds of up to 37mbps at most after checking all the cables were ok. I called BT to down grade my package as I was not willing to pay for speeds that were impossible for me to receive. I was told they could not down grade my package and that to down grade I would have to sign on to another 12 month contract for which I refused and told them that it was they that are in breach of the contract for lying about the speeds I could receive in the first place to debate went on with customer services for almost half an hour. All they kept trying to do was tie me into another contract by saying there was nothing they could do, it was nothing short of blackmail the tactics they tried with me and I blatantly refused. In the end I finally managed to get through to them but my word they made it hard.
I'm sure it must be illegal to make someone pay for something they won't receive."
bell,devon,9/1/15,a most disgusting service- in fact the worst I have ever received from any company. It has been so far an 8 month nightmare which is now resulting in me asking for a deadlock letter. I am utterly appalled that any company should be allowed to trade in this way. there is no way I would ever suggest BT broadband to anyone. in fact their broadband in my view should be subject to external government scrutiny
David,Scotland,9/1/15,It might be OK if I could get it! Ordered it a month ago and still waiting for it despite the BT promises of to-morrow. Oh! yeah I forgot to-morrow never comes.
lynn cooper,sunderland,9/1/15,I tried to cancel my service with BT 6months ago as I thought I had a 1sr contact but they informed me my broadband was for 18 months. so I rang them today to tell them I will not be renewing my contract which runs out on 17th September. I was told that the service will cease on 9th of September. I said no on 17th September.so he said he changed it and that I will receive an email to confirm and low and behold I have received the email with the 9th of September. I am so angry. and I have also been told that I have to pay a £30 charge for not renewing my contract. is this right????. never again
A Nichols,Yelverton Devon,9/1/15,"We normally struggle by with 3MBPS. A month ago I reported the line as repeatedly dropping and the speed down to 0.2MBPS. I've spent hours on the phone to call centres, listened to their infernal queueing musak, waited in for them to turn up -two no shows. Now expecting a broadband engineer to turn up next week. If I wasn't on a fixed term contract I'd have dumped them."

Saeiduk,plymouth,8/31/15,"For me it was a big mistake to switch from Sky to BT. BT informed me and Sky a date to switch services, but after disconnecting my broadband delayed the new connection which took them 10 days. My several plea to them to reconnect me did not produce any result. Their call centre is in India and they only give lip service. Their only explanation for the delay was ""there has been an exception"" and they just repeat this like a robot. No matter what number you dial you are always diverted to the same call centre. It is almost impossible to talk to anyone who can take some action. Out of desperation I wrote a letter to their customer services manager in UK, but have not received a reply from them either. In my view BT broadband is no different from other providers but their after sale service is very poor."

JohnB,London,8/29/15,"Shame on you BT, SHAME!

I originally lost our internet connection on the 21st July. I had a chat with an agent online on the 23rd July to notify them we were without broadband. They said they would look into it, send an engineer out & contact me about what was happening. I didn't hear anything back for over a week, on the 2nd August I contacted BT again. They said an engineer had been scheduled for the 6th August. I waited. After the 6th I got a message saying the problem had been fixed. But it hadn't! After calling they said that the problem is not fixed yet & were working on it. Another week went by & no word, so I called BT. I got cut off twice. I spoke to one person & had to be transferred & then got cut off AGAIN. When I finally got to speak to someone, they said the job had been closed & no body was working on! They said they would get an engineer out to me on the 24th August. I also asked this person, and I was very clear about this, asking if I cancelled with BT today, would I be subject to any charges, cancellation fee's or do I need to give any notice for the cancellation of my account. They said no, because I was out of my BT contact fixed date. I made it very clear, regarding not only 'cancellation charges' & ANY other charges, they said no.

The couldn't fix the problem on the 24th, and had to come back again on the 25th. This time, the engineer actually fixed it. But the engineered told me there was no fault and I had actually been cut off from BT broadband. He told me he didn't know how this had happened as no problems were shown with my account.

I asked them if I can get compensation on top of remuneration because of being cut off & they said I will also get compensation. I got a call on Friday 28th and she was now telling me that not only would I not get any compensation, I would only get remuneration from the 2nd August as this is when she believed I first reported the fault, when in fact this was the 23rd July. I got a call back on 29th August from a was very rude agent. I asked to speak to his manager. He said he was the manager. Later it came out in he does have a manager.

Furthermore, I then found out from the cancellation team that if I cancel I will be charged £30 for discounting me from the exchange & I would need to give 30 days notice! This was not as discussed with the service team before, and I was misinformed about the process of cancellations. If they were not in a position to give information on this, they should not have advised. If I had been given the correct information in the first place, I would have said to the engineer to just keep me disconnected and we'll walk our separate ways.

I also found out after checking my bill for this month I had been charged for the BT sport package. This is something I have not requested. I fail to understand how this was even added, when I have no internet! I still don't know if this has been removed of my bill as they couldn't tell me."

Richard portas,Wales,8/28/15,Do not change houses with BT. Ever! By far the worst customer services and installation team that has ever existed. Nobody has control of the process and they will not provide any compensation for loss of broadband service when reinstalling is delayed. It took them 2.5 months to change over our broadband.
Umesh AW,London,8/27/15,"Order BT - Did biggest Mistake of life : Got Call from BT to Pay £50 deposit While knowing my Credit score is much higher than BT Value I Paid £50 ( 2nd mistake).
5 Days Passed Not even Single email confirming my order or status, Everyday after work trying to call BT - hour of hold - disconnected finally (I have life to live - other than BT connection )
They are treating new customer like this cant imagine How they will treat later. Called The number where I paid £50 - Rudely Lady told me I cant answer - our job is to take money , I dont know order status - I will transfer call - after hour on hold finally disconnected.

OVERALL experience - HELL Wanna continue with sky , please cancel my order and Give my £50 back ASAP"
Peter Eames,"Chard, Somerset",8/27/15,"We are just on standard broadband as connected directly to the exchange (95yards). Download speed is about 13mbps, so not too bad. The service dose drop out every now and then, but generally not too bad. Customer Service is time consuming, but they sort it eventually."
Bracdiver,"Tarbert, Argyll",8/27/15,"Speed is middle of the road, customer service is the worst. The whole process is actually abusive. From the long wait with the phone ringing the whole time (music anyone), to asking the same questions repeatedly, to intentionally obfuscating the situation, to an obvious goal of getting you off the phone vs. solving the problem and ultimately succeeding because there is no alternative and no quality control. The worst of the worst in terms of customer service. average to poo in terms of quality of product."
Andy Gordon,Surrey,8/26/15,BT Customer Service- a communications firm where the left hand would have to put you on hold for 23 minutes while it finds out if it has the authorisation to confirm there is a right hand.
kunduku,West Kirby,8/26/15,I have never dealt with such an appalling company. They just want to squeeze the most they can out of the customer and it would appear nothing and no one can stop them. They are a law unto themselves and I feel that even the Ombudsman is far more interested in supporting BT than the man in the street.
JAMES,Bournemouth,8/26/15,Truly shocking never known a company like it -Totally Arrogant - 100% Do not care at all
Michael stringer,denbighshire,8/25/15,"Not impressed. All I wanted was broadband that I would enable me to surf the web, check emails. My router wouldn't even work despite BT saying It was activated, I had no service. Basically I was waiting a ridiculous length of time (almost 2 months) and was still waiting 6to 7 weeks later with no broadband. Long queues, sometimes as long as half an hour. This is how BT treats new customers. I ended up cancelling. I'd had 2 bt engineer visits, one of which BT didn't turn up at my property as someone was at home waiting for the BT engineer."
Brian Judge,Hayle,8/24/15,"This is the ISP from hell. Days wasted waiting for engineers to install, empty promises, misinformation and downright lies!

david makin,norfolk,8/23/15,"BT are the worst company i have ever dealt with, was looking to upgrade to infinity2 agreed price on phone e mail confirmation through wrong price wrong contract length. rang to query this was told that they could not agree this deal as it was through a third party even though it was through bt website.rang back another day after various phone calls and being fobbed off was offered a good disccounted price, no confirmation e mail came through sevearal phone calls later including often being cut off i have been told that no order has been placed and i could not have it at discounted pricei know see that i am not alone in this and they are mis selling their products on a regular basis is this not illegal. I dont expect to have this resolved to be honest and am in a 10 month contract which i consider they cannot hold me to. final resort will be to cancel direct debit and go without internet until resolved."

RobC,Bristol,8/22/15,"APPAULING CUSTOMER SERVICE DO NOT USE BT!!!!! Problems with billing going on for months, my quarterly bill should be around £180 (Phone & Broadband), I received one for over £800!!! months later and over 30 (yes thirty) calls to, so called, customer service still not sorted. This is the worst experience I have EVER had of customer service, they clearly don't care and/or are completely incompetent. I regret moving to BT and will be leaving as soon as I can. Written complaint to BT and OFCOM sent. My advice AVOID at all costs!!!"
Brian,Hayle,8/22/15,"This company would appear to be institutionally incapable of living up to promises made to customers. It's customer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. After over two hours on the phone today having been asked by BT to contact them regarding my order, I am still waiting for the answer to a simple question!! My question has now changed to 'Can you cancel my order please?'"
Iain Hobson,Middlewich,8/21/15,Absolutely terrible! Constant lies. I was with them for 1 month and lost count of the amount of calls to customer service. Every time I rang I would be on hold for a very long time and then they fob you off onto someone else and put on hold again. 1 person says the opposite to an other. I had to cancel today as I was having to ring them everyday because they messed up an order and failed to activate my service.
Alan Woolstenholmes,Ramsey,8/21/15,Avoid this cowboy company at all costs. Literally the worst company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Had no phone or broadband for over 12 weeks now. Six engineer vists scheduled but none have ever turned up. It's getting to the point where I have no where to turn but pursue the legal route. This company are a bunch of lying con artists who do nothing to help there customers.Avoid Avoid Avoid !!!!!!
garry,blyth,8/20/15,"I recently moved from talk talk to bt on their infinity 1 package and took the tv starter so i could get the sport channels on my tv.
The transfer of the telephone line went smoothly but the broadband disconnected and didnt come back on, i waited until the following day to contact them, as i know you are advised that it can take up to midnight.
When i got through the lady was very helpful, she explained there was a fault on the fibre line which is why it wasnt activated on that day. She explained that it was scheduled for 2 weeks time and she would look to expedite the date and contact me on the following monday.
Unfortunately i had missed the call on the monday, so i called back in and spoke to another gentleman who told me that he could not do anything about the date and instead gave me a credit of £55.95 to cover my activation fees and the delivery of the hub.
I then got a phone call from the lady on the tuesday who explained she had managed to get the date moved forward and the broadband was activated on the following day.
Yes i was without broadband for 1 week but they were so helpful getting the service activated for me and ensuring i wasnt out of pocket for my troubles.
When the football season started at the start of august i was made aware of the increase in the cost of sport, i had a feeling there would be a charge for the european football package, £5 i can live with.
I decided to get the sports in hd on the day of the community shield and was told that i could have it free for 3 months, bonus.
Since then i decided i may as well get the uhd package as i was pleased with the service ao far. £15 extra minus the £5 for aport so i am only paying £10 a month more and couldnt be happier the broadband is so much more reliable with bt. When i had talk talk i would often experience a lot of buffering during peak times and honestly ive forgotten what that feels like."
Steve,Bradford,8/20/15,
Pat,Oakham,8/19/15,"I very rarely post reviews of this nature but my experience today with BT has been so frustrating I want to do something in the hope BT will address their complete lack of customer service.
I have been a BT customer for many years; land line and broadband. On Sat 15th August my Internet failed. I quickly ascertained from BT that I needed a new hub. This could be supplied if I renewed my contract. I agreed and the hub was due to arrive yesterday. It did not arrive and today I received a letter confirming my contract but no hub.
I have today spent over three hours on the telephone with an overseas call centre and all I have achieved is to make myself really cross.
Consequently I decided to change supplier. Within less than an hour of doing this I received an e-mail asking me to reconsider with a request to call a completely different telephone number. I was also informed if I did change I would be charged almost £320 in cancellation fees. Despite the fact I cancelled within the 14 days and BT had failed to fulfil their part of the agreement. When I rang the call was answered immediately. Clearly BT respond only when they are in danger of losing business, existing customers are of no value.
BT need to address the use of overseas call centres. Whilst the people who work in the centres are very pleasant they are completely ineffective."
Gail W,"Yardley Hastings, Northampton",8/19/15,"I have always had a reliable line, When I left my previous suppliers I had speeds of 7-8mbps. I moved to BT big mistake they never manually updated the IP profile and left me to 2mbps. Phoned them switched off the modem put it back on, of course this fixed nothing. I told the technician that their was a fault on my line 1 year ago and what the problem was. He disputed this knowing best and arranged a callback to book an open reach engineer put WTF?


I eventually didn't bother and attempted to swap back to my previous supplier with BT saying all I have to pay for is for what I used.



17th 2015 changed their mind I must pay for the full contract.



Along with this they ran tests from a department that cannot run any tests (wtf)

another lie I got told is ""bt openreach is in your area upgrading your cabinet and exchange""

This one annoyed me the most they WASN'T THERE, I've been wanting fibre for a LONG TIME and attempted to use this as an excuse for rubbish speeds.

If you enjoy being lied too, ignored for being more intelligent then the staff this is the company for you.


If not keep to sky or +net"
Arabind,London,8/19/15,Here we go another scam of BT without knowing they added couple of package in my bills and i'm trying to contact them but there is no answer at all from their customer service .... Worst customer service
Aurelia,London,8/19/15,"BT is the worst company (all services included) I have ever dealt with.
1) the service itself is bad: in my old flat we kept having to reboot the router (several times a day) for it to work, which means the internet cut off all the time. This lasted 3 years. In my new flat, they randomly cancelled my order and my internet was activated 3 weeks after I ordered it - and I am in a flat where all the infrastructure was already installed with BT and everything worked.
2) most important: horrible customer service. Every time I speak to someone new I get told different things, and they are pure lies. BT never do what they promise: they say they call you at X time on X day, that doesn't happen so you have to chase for it, then they tell you something else, which again they don't do. Now for the 3rd time I am promised a phone call to discuss my complaints and compensastion but that takes almost a week, and I am not even sure they will call.

Absolutely NOT to be trusted: their service is bad and they treat customers appallingly, this is really serious."
Chris Taylor,Devon,8/19/15,"I ordered a BT Home Hub 5. It was neither despatched nor delivered but I was quickly charged £69 plus delivery. When I complained I was sold a new contract that would include a free Hub 5 and told that they would cancel the original order and refund my money. Three weeks of misery and five long phone calls later I have been promised a refund to my bank, then told I could only be refunded via my next bill. None of this has happened. The customer help staff give a different story each time and say that ""It will definitely be sorted this time."" All lies!"
julian malein,Admaston Staffordshire,8/18/15,
C Bozard,Fulham,8/17/15,"We are stuck with BT although we are unable to get the TV channels that were promised to us. Their TV department is completely unhelpful. TV customer service representatives are difficult to understand, offer assistance that makes no sense and don't appear to really listen to what your situation is. We've had numerous repairmen out to the flat and they can't resolve the problem. BT says its not their fault so we are stuck paying for channels we can't get. Don't' sign up until you know for sure you are able to get the service or you'll be stuck like me."
Annonymous,Surrey,8/16/15,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Spoken to about 9-10 different people regarding the same issue. All claim to 'update' notes online so each member can follow up with the order, but had to discuss same issue over and over again with all staff clueless each time. Unbelievably frustrating. Would move to ANY other provider, however none in our block of flats.
Could not be more frustrated or angry. Almost one month since we first placed our order, only to hear one day ago that we have to replace our order due to the incompetence at BT."
Beachlover,Isle of Wight,8/14/15,"I have given very low stars for speed and reliability. I would have given no stars if there was an option. I joined BT in June 2015. I order VDSL1 and had reliable service with no drops and I had the max speed my line could support. I was over the moon as previous ADSL2 was only supporting 6 meg download. 36 meg ddownload. This lasted only two months and in Aug 2015 the Home Hub 5 kept crashing. It crashed and rebooted every 3 minutes. I called customer service and they reset my line profile. Which means they reduced my noise margins, line attenuation and signal attenuation. This meant I now get speeds of 5 meg. Not only that the Home hub 5 still crashes so nothing has been resolved.
I am still trying to communicate with BT India, but I seem to know more about the technicalities that they do.
If I get a resolution i might revise this feedback. Let see what happens.
The good news is that although im tied into a 12 month contract I have read that we are able to terminate if we are not delivered the speeds promised."
Santosh,Swindon,8/13/15,"I had the BT broadband,TV and phone from by for two years as they were charging the highest rate as the contract monthly was £42 per month it never did came less then £54 a month so now I have to move to my new address what happened was that I called the costumer service for cancelation of service they told me I will be charged £100 plus so I had no choice to stay instead of continue agreement they gave me new no new contract which I have to accept but I was not moving from my present property they cut my all lines and started my new contract as I moved into new property they were suppose to give me the Internet line n phone but didnot n have to wait for a month now a few weeks ago I got the line n was happy but today the line of phone n Internet isn't there so I called the costumer service and they told me it will be fixed after three working days or more by the engeneer but no fix date so I am really unhappy with BT . so I suggest to have other phone line n Internet and waiting when the contract ends I will never keep BT .its not BT it's Bad Treat"
Rebecca Sewell,North West,8/13/15,"Appalling service. Like so many, we only went with them because my boyfriend wanted BT sport. They have ripped us off every month for the last year. They have LIED to us over and over, changing contractual agreements and pricing for broadband and BT sport it is nearly £50 PER MONTH! We have no home phone and the BT sport has not been used since we moved house 4 months ago and yet every month our bill goes up and up. They refuse to offer a refund and an explanation. CANNOT WAIT TO SWITCH NEXT MONTH."
Elizabeth Cassidy,London,8/13/15,"Been trying to place order with BT broadband for the last week now and every time at the last bit of the order procedure it comes up with a screen saying Technical Error Ref #CON-0067. I found the bt brodband deal through site topcashback, a site I have used numerous times and has worked well. After a week of contacting BT not a single member of any customer services, sales or 'Easy Assist' team was able to help me complete my order. None of them could even explain what the error code meant and if it was ever going to be fixed. Useless company with useless customer services."
I hate BT,Cornwall,8/13/15,"Speed rarely reaches 1mb, if more than one person uses the internet it crawls. Engineers have been out and confirm a problem with BT's line locally but has never been fixed. Over £30/month and can't even play a youtube video at peak times? AVOID BT. They LIe."
SM,Reading,8/12/15,"Thieves! Started to charge me for a service I never asked for. I complained they said they would refund and passed me on to someone else. Then was told it couldn't be refunded. Will be pursuing this further. Fortunately my contract is almost up so will be leaving. Also is very difficult to get through, probably due to all the other people complaining about being ripped off."
Hayley,Bedfordshire,8/12/15,"What a farce! Report problem, promised engineer will come out and wait a week for appt, doesn't show, another appt, doesn't show, another appt, doesn't show. Been promised tomorrow... I'm just guessing what will happen! What a joke!"
Tom,"Kent, UK",8/12/15,"Unfortunately I have the displeasure of dealing with BT in my personal and working life - albeit different arms of the same incompetent beast.
In <4 months of being in what essentially is a BT only area the issues I have experienced are:
- had my broadband date moved back numerous times (over 6 weeks from the initial install date) without reason.
- been charged for the telephone line (which I HAVE to take) during that period yet it fulfilled no purpose.
- had broadband dropouts on a regular basis despite being a few hundred yards from a BT exchange.
- had a BT home hub failure.
- spent 10+ hours on the phone to BT chasing them when they do not call back regarding an issue.
- had BT take my broadband from operational to inoperable whilst making my TV services 'live'. They 'pulled out the stops' and got it back up 4 days later.
-provided an overall pathetic service. The only hopeful piece I can state is that their offshore call centre employs very polite people - if not very competent ones.

On top of this their staff don't listen and I have very little feeling that their services will improve at all. Awful company, awful personnel underpinning an atrocious service."
Rico,Scotland,8/11/15,"Awful. Absolutely awful. Contrasting 'advice', huge call queues, one of the worst customer services i have ever had. I would rather give my money to a charity and have no internet than fund these clowns."
jane thomas,woking,8/11/15,"BT are a terrible service provider.
SLOW SPEEDS, CONSTANT DROPS, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
They LIE.
They don't fix your problem.
They lie about sending engineers.
They are a joke and a disgrace.
THEY ARE A JOKE"
Tom Martin`,Surrey,8/11/15,
Andy,Salisbury,8/10/15,"My broadband speed is 0.13Mbps and keeps dropping out. also heavy packet loss. The local engineers (openreach) know where the issues are, however there has to be a long, totally pointless and useless conversation with BT everytime before they'll ever get round to sending an engineer out. Overall the support and efficiency of the BT customer service is truly awful"
Trevor Owen,Ormskirk / West Lancashire,8/9/15,"Beware of this company, they don't honour their offers..

I switched from TalkTalk to BT in August 2015 after signing up with then on 20th June 2015. The package was for b/b and w/e calls + bt sport free for the duration of the 12 month contract. Now that the football season is here I tried to activate the sport on my pc but nothing happened.

After making several calls to BT and spoken to their chat line I have been told that the deal changed and I now have to pay £5.00 extra per month for the something which was a free gift.

I just got thru talking to a very nasty c/s dept who would not pass me over to a manager or supervisor, had the cheek to ask why I had only just noticed the service was missing and said that the deals were changed in July. I am guessing that the internet offer was only there to get the business.

Disgrace all round"
James,Durham,8/8/15,"Worst experience ever with a company. They sell themselves are the premium option in the broadband market. This is far from the truth.

They're over a month late with my order and keep wasting my time with missed appointments and excuses.

They've now had the audacity to bill me for service which isn't even connected and say I must pay the bill and be refunded the following month.

They claim the order has become 'stuck' and must be re-ordered.

Avoid at all costs."
Brian,Isle of Wight,8/6/15,"Have been with BT 7 Years now ADSL and fiber broadband.
Contract up for renewal this December.
Moving to wightfiber, had enough of BT'S poor customer support and lack of knowledge"
"John,",Croydon,8/3/15,"Been a BT customer for a number of years and currently have BT Infinity. I moved from Eclipse who for me were the best but at that stage didn't kprovide fibre. Fortunately I have had few problems with BT, if I did I would have gone elsewhere. My gripes:
I upgraded to super fast fibre last year, apart from a slight increase in upload speed I did not notice any difference. Numerous online tests followed until I discovered that BT cannot provide superfast fibre in my area. When I spoke to customer services it was ""my fault"" as I did not formalise a complaint.

In my view BT don't take care of their own customers - you will wait between 30 minutes to get through to customer services. Horrendous.llloll

BT won't negotiate at renewal, fantastic offers for new customers but unlike competitors and for the rest of us no incentive to remain. I was offered a £1.15 discount on broadband on the basis I had paid a whole year for a service BT couldn't provide.

I've renewed again this year to allow me to find a reliable ISP that takes care of its customers - if there is one out there."
Keith Bennett,Dunblane,8/3/15,"Dreadful, just dreadful.

I was told I could upgrade to faster broadband - so signed up for it. On the (delayed) activation day the service did not work. I waited all day for it to activate, it didn't. Ended up on the phone to India for an hour - they arranged for an engineer to visit 3 days later.
The engineer arrived one hour early - luckily my son was in, I wasn't.
The engineer confirmed that faster broadband was not available - I am apparently too far away from the exchange (3 miles) and I will NEVER be able to receive faster broadband. I asked him if he could reactivate my old BT broadband - he said 'No'. Apparently my 'old protocols had been wiped, by BT, in the Exchange'. He then told me I (yes, that's right, me!) needed to contact BT - I thought I was already speaking to BT! Apparently not - I was speaking to an engineer from BT Openreach...and that's different to BT Retail.
So I call BT Retail - speak to 2 people in India who can't help me, then 2 in the UK - one of whom can help me (this call takes 1 hour 20 minutes). The BT UK Agent can 'help me' by 'passing on a request to reactivate my old service' - but I'll have to wait 5 working days (a week!) for them to put right what they turned off because they couldn't deliver the service I was sold and didn't even check it first!I will be without broadband for at least 2 weeks in total thanks to BT misselling a service, cutting off my old service and putting me back in a queue to wait whilst they fox what should never have been broken in the first place.
Oh, and I've complained too but I've been told that I'll have to wait 18 days for a response because they are 'very busy right now' - sounds like that's a major signal that your service is utterly crap, BT.
Appalling."
Bethan,London,8/3/15,"Absolutely appalling service and I haven;t even received my internet package yet.

Arabind,London,8/2/15,I was with sky before i didn't have any problem.when BT people ring me they said they r better than sky and i fall for it now i regret worst broadband as soon as it is weekend i had prob can't wait till my contract ..... Going back to SKY ... Please don't fall for the offer Bt make to their customer
Heli,Planet Earth,8/1/15,"Poor, poor service. I have called BT on three occasions (each lasting well over an hour while they pass me from person to person)to help me with my broadband connection constantly dropping out. They must be reading from a script as they in no way attempt to answer any of the problems I have. They refused to upgrade my hub to a hub5 while they offer new customers, welcome vouchers to the tune of £125 while they treat current customers like second class citizens. I have just moved to Sky where the service and attitude is more courteous and informative. BT - your service needs to improve (I was left on hold for 25mins!). No-one appears to have any influence on making decisions - they just pass you on. A dreadful broadband service and customer service. Glad I moved on!"
ben waistell,wolverhampton,7/31/15,"Really bad service, should be called, Bollywood Telecom, the people you get through to have not got a clue, spent four hours on the phone so far, two hours in chat rooms, got nowhere, they can not even sort out my board band upgrade, over charged for service that was supposed to be free, can I get refund no, they take your money and you try getting it back, the actual line service works well, just a shame no one knows how to sell an upgrade, and sort out over charging,"
Nik,Southampton,7/30/15,"I wouldn't NEVER recommend using BT broadband to anyone! Wanted to change mine from Orange to BT, phoned up and they told me they would be able to cancel my live box contract. The Bt hub arrived but didn't connect so phoned up and they said an engineer would be able to come out, who never turned up! Also turns out they never cancelled our current orange box and we are still in the same position we started in! BT ARE USELESS!!!!"
Stuart,London,7/30/15,"Wanted to swap from Business broadband to BT Infinity...1st call got me transferred to 4 different people before he said if we get cut off ill call you back on your mobile, call got cut off and no call made to moble.
2nd call got transferred to a home number
3rd call got me transferred to another home number
4th call to a different number took me so I was miffed and wanted to cancel altogether, she said she couldn't cancel it as I didn't have my account number to hand, when asked to speak to a supervisor she said no you will need to ring back (probably to her again)
I will just cancel the phone bill with the bank and wait for the phone call from them"

Tom,Derbyshire,7/29/15,"I had BT Broadband (9meg) for two years and have to say overall I was generally pleased with it.
I consistently received the promised speed and the reliability was very good (think it went off once for an hour in the
two years).

As soon as infinity was available in my area I 'upgraded'. How I wish I hadn't!!
I've had 'super fast' supposedly 35Mbps broadband now for 4 months, of which it's only really been usable for about one
month in total. I very regularly experience speed drops, on average a drop of 90% of my connection speed to < 1mbps and I'd say
my average speed is probably lower than I had on their 9Mbps connection. I've lost count of the number of times I've called BT and had callbacks scheduled for them to return my calls
to on several occasions not receive said call back.

Everytime you call you have to go through the same 20 questions, reboot your router etc. which is infuriating (I've a
degree in computer science and I'm a software developer so I have a pretty good understanding of how it should work) but they still
make you go through their script and refuse to escalate you to someone you can actually talk too instead of playing 21 questions.
After around 20 calls to them I finally got them to arrange an engineers visit to my house for a set date/timeslot and ensured I was
in, they didn't turn up! When I enquired where the engineer was I was told the job had been assigned to an engineer who wasn't
qualified to do the job so he'd rejected it but I'd not been notified so had been sat in waiting for nothing. Another engineer
was scheduled to come the following day. This time he did turn up and I have to say was fantastic! He was with me for around 3
hours and we talked in length about it and he told me he knew there was nothing wrong with my connection and that it was a fault
at BT's end (a throughput issue) which he couldn't do anything about (the engineers are part of openreach who aren't actually the same company as the
BT who supply the service!). He ran all the diagnostics he could and then phoned BT again on my behalf to explain everything
and we both started laughing when he was made to perform the same basic tasks as I was each time I phoned. ""have you rebooted the
router"", ""can you try it on a cable"" etc, etc. What a joke - they don't even trust the engineers they send out to know what they're
on about.

After many many more calls between myself and BT there's still be no real resolution or explanation from BT themselves or any
form of compensation for not being able to use the service I've been paying for for months! I've had other issues too such as
certain pages refusing to load until you refresh several times, something I discovered many people across the country were having
on the BT customer forums yet again BT refuse to acknowledge a problem. I now find myself experiencing issues that prevent
me being able to use the service I'm paying for and I really cannot be bothered to call them to report them as I have no faith
whatsoever in their 'technical' support and don't want to go through the pain and arguments with their first line 'technicians'
to get nowhere. I have to say if I had any other options in my area I wouldn't be with BT!"
Chris,Northampton,7/27/15,"Overall installation was quick and painless. The speed was a great improvement over our old provider and the HH5 performed reasonably well.

However after the first 8 months we have noticed a considerable drop in reliability in our connection to the HH5, we have normally 3 mobiles and 2 pc's connected at once and the router will flat out stop responding for a good few minutes.

Not sure if it is just our device or what, but I have read that this is a problem that happens to this version of the home hub."
mazza,nottinghamshire,7/27/15,"BT infinity. thats what this contract seems like and so does the telephone calls of complaint I've tried to make - infinity. I have buffering on all you tube/music etc. connection drops out every few minutes. This is on a new laptop with wifi. I can only EVER get through to someone in India who doesn't seem to understand English, talks over you when you try to explain that ""No we tried that yesterday and the day before and the day before that and all last week and I am not prepared to do the same things YET AGAIN"" was offered an engineer at £125. NO I dont want to pay for someone to come and check why I am not getting what I am paying for on my monthly contract. I am paying for it to work, if it doesnt work, I am not paying to find out why it doesnt work. they should be doing that."
jenny,burnopfield,7/27/15,"My broadband has been fine only issues are with the TV package.
Absolutely horrendous customer service, after them overcharging my account by £70.04 they withheld my money and said they would take it off my bills each month until it was paid back, every month i had to ring to complain as they continued to take money from me, this has went on for 4 months. At every phone call trying to speak to so called managers with unpronounceable names, getting nowhere was very frustrating, also when asking questions and explaining my frustration to be given a number of long silences with no answers adding to my frustration, i think is an appalling way to treat a customer, when asking for a reference number for which i have many off them now after every phone call, he tried to give me a digit less, so when he heard me counting the digits he then repeated the number giving me an extra digit, knowing his mistake. I cannot wait to be out of my contract with them and will not be using them again."
Zeynep,Reading,7/24/15,"BT was a nightmare and the services I received was poorly. The speed was so variable and quite often I could not read newspapers online because of weak internet speed. When I have had broadband issues it was unbelieveable how BT handled my complaints from India. It was terrible. I noticed that BT people over the phone were telling different things about the problem and it was not innocious mistakes they were rather lies about when BT will resolve the problem or what was the problem. BT has ruined my work as I was working from home and I have been hugely dependent on e-mails which did not work with BT.
I warn you be careful about BT and do not waste your time BT look something else....I lost quite few years with BT and paid so much. I wish I have never have had this unprofessional services from BT.
I feel spry for those Indian agents on the other end of the phone line who were forced to lie about the services they offer.... Shame on BT!"
James,Cornwall,7/24/15,
Unhappy of Surrey,Surrey,7/24/15,Shambolic customer service. A week after they disconnected my previous supplier I am still waiting to be connected. So far 3 missed connection dates.
Tracy,Caerphilly,7/23/15,Broadband has never worked the engineer who installed my brand new line left with no working system not knowing why...... BT customer services are a joke - never actually return phone calls - though I have had mysterious silent mobile answer phone messages with no associated phone call- I'm sick of repeating myself and I'm sick of being spoken to like an idiot as if I can't plug in a bleeding hub correctly . They have now cleared my 'fault ' on the online fault tracker ..... I wish ! It all seems like they are cooking their figures for Ofcom ! The public are not that stupid ! I'm so close to just returning the hub etc and telling them to shove their broadband .......if you're thinking of using BT all I can say is DONT!!
Jeremy,Engalnd,7/19/15,"BT broadband is terrible the connection speed is poor at best and cannot stream anything without buffering on multiple occasions, even though advertised as super fast and no buffering. The service is poor and would recommend any broadband service except BT"
Ryan Stojic,Bideford,7/19/15,"I was very happy with my BT package until I was talked into upgrading to fibre optic earlier this year. The promise of substantially better speeds for little additional cost was too hard to refuse......something I now wish I could take back.

For several months the connection has been little better than standard broadband but for much of the time I found myself completely without.
I've waited days for line tests, had a replacement hub, and promises of a satisfactory speed, and all whilst I was still paying BT the full monthly fee. After I questioned my payments for a service I was not getting I was promptly promised compensation which would be handled by the BT billing department.

On receipt of my latest bill I was disappointed to see no discount or refund had been applied. I'd also had no further contact from BT on the matter.
I phoned BT to find out why I'd received no compensation as per their promise and, after an hour on the phone to 4 different people, was told that refunds and compensation were only given if there had been a total loss of service. To say I was furious is an understatement.
Although the download and upload speeds have now improved the connection constantly drops out, and streams, posts and data are almost always struggling to refresh.

I can put up with faults and loss of service provided they are being dealt with and I can see progress. However, why the hell BT expect me to continue to pay for this is downright theft. But worst of all is being lied to when I was ASSURED compensation. If I was to lie to clients in my position I would swiftly find myself looking for alternative employment.
It seems I'm forced to sit out my contract with BT before I give an alternative supplier a try.
Horrendous experience."
dave ashton,glasgow,7/18/15,Took BT broadband out then got a marketing letter saying if I did not respond they would add other services and charge me! This they claim is legal! asked how much to cancel and they wanted over 200 quid even though I have 10 months left at 5 per month! AVOID AVOID AVOID
Jonners,HANTS,7/17/15,"Four months no internet, 4 promised call backs and Indian call center operatives, who I'm sure are very nice people but cannot deviate from a script and will not help your cause. DO NOT TOUCH BT WITH A BARGEPOLE"
Colin Mills,Kingston-Upon-Thames,7/17/15,"My phone line hasn't worked for over a month. I raised a ticket and they said they'd fixed it but they hadn't so i re-opened it after which, nothing.

So I phoned them (06:30 am) and got straight through to Gibson. He was very helpful, checked the line and confirmed there was a fault. He raised another ticket and it is due to be fixed within a week. Plus I get a refund on my line rental.

So apart from the delay in getting the line fixed, customer support were very helpful"

I got 7Mb/min unlimited B/b, landline, unlimited anytime calls - Now I pay the same to a Diff provider but I get 32Mb and satellite TV and landline and anytime calls and unlimited fibre plus a free 32 inch LED TV!!!!! BT have a lot to answer for if you ask me."

Jeremy,Ballymena,7/14/15,BT are liars. Firstly they never supplied the Sainsburys vouchers after I joined and have queried twice. Secondly I was promised a phone call after I complained that I wasn't getting BTSport on my devices and it never came. Having spent probably two hours trying to explain my problem I was left with no satisfaction. I even gave control of my computer to them and they ended up telling me exactly what I told them within the first minute. I am now paying for a service that I am not getting and BT really don't care. I have written a letter to them and still no-one has the decency to call me or sort out my problem. Absolutely avoid.
Ben,Wright,7/14/15,"This service is an absolute disgrace. Customer services / technical faults mislead and lie to you. The broadband speed is no way near what was promised and constantly cuts out. Complete and utter waste of money. And they will not even release me from the contract despite not providing what I asked for!

The technical faults team have been talking to me for three months since I had the problem. Initially I was informed they merely had to ensure it wasn't a wireless problem and they would reset then boost the line. Well, I ran all the speed tests and used an Ethernet cable for my broad band direct from the socket with a new filter as requested. Still rubbish. They therefore reset the line. Then it still didn't work. I raised it with them on the phone and they advised I wait 20 days. Still nothing. Then a call, they blamed it on a wireless problem inspite of the tests showing that that it wasn't - they wen reset the line. They then stated they couldn't guarantee wireless speed. I raised it with other representatives via twitter and got the same answer in a long and pointless email.

The broadband never goes above 3.5 Mbps and is often much less. The line constantly drops out. Watching films and multimedia without interruption is a pipe dream. I was promised about 10mbps. Yesterday my partner was told that nothing was guaranteed and that I had no right to cancel. She was told to consult the small print. The sooner the OFCOM changes come into place allowing me to quit the better. I cannot dissuade you strongly enough. BT is not the firm it was and they do not care about the customer or quality of the product. They just want to squeeze a margin out of you. Go with Virgin... I never had a problem with them and the line was awesome!"
brett,stafford,7/13/15,"After waiting in for three seperate engineer appointments I still haven't seen an engineer, each missed appointment resulted in me phoning BT to be told a different lie about why they never turned up. Three weeks after placing my order I have now been guaranteed (for the second time) that my engineer will connect me on two weeks. Apparrently my order got stuck in the system."
F M Ross,ST Germans,7/13/15,"Utterly useless in all aspects, over a month with speeds of less than 0.5 via Bt speed test through their customer service, and I get told to update my laptop, or buy fibre. I have had trouble free Internet, not very fast, 7mb, for four years, then they take me off exchange only line to a cabinet and I cant do anything, can't watch TV, load a photo, send and email or pay for anything, the connection drops out, or it won't stream at all. All this for over £43 a month. Accelerating the fault to a complaint has just landed me with even more Indian call centre people ringing me, but they won't do anything other than test the line, after a month of testing every three to five days I've had enough. As I Say USELESS"
Iain Darling,GU47 0ZA,7/12/15,"If I could give Zero stars I would - it is absolutely terrible, abysmal, appalling, shameful, not fit for purpose, over-priced dross! Need to move to somewhere that has Virgin cabling so at least I have an option as Talk Talk, etc. all use BT lines so cannot be any better than BT who are the pits (Being very polite with my adjectives, but BT ""narrow""band and BT E-mail must be about the worst products I have ever used. Would advise anyone I know to use any other provider - nobody can possibly be worse."
Karen,Milton Keynes,7/11/15,"Broadband is super-slow. Customer service continued to reel off the speeds from their internet site and would not accept that they were talking BS. Calls taking so long as its hard to understand the BT staff abroad. Basically the same as what many people have written here. BT broadband is almost useless, cs are awkward and lie and shift the blame. The reliability is virtualy zero."
Omar,London,7/10/15,"They are useless, left me without internet for my first week as a new customer coming from another provider. Not recommended at all. Can't solve any problem with them. Avoid"
Robert,Croydon,7/9/15,"BT is a joke- Low speeds and line dropping for hours at a time for over two months. Technician visited and checked my equipment said there was a problem with the exchange to my property. Call centre called me to inform me of the progress of the repair and told me that the case had been resolved. I told her what the technician had told me and the speeds i am getting is not the same as what i was told i would get when i entered into a contract. She spoke over me, would not listen and told me i was trying to get compensation. I called the UK base customer service and they were the same. An absolute joke"

Mandy Gilmour,Shropshire,7/8/15,"Two weeks ago my broadband usage suddenly shot up from 8.64GB on the friday to 16.46GB on sat. I'd been out most of the day and knew it couldn't possibly be right so I contacted BT on their online chat and a gentleman called Zahid spent about 20 mins trying to find out what the problem was. He asked me to monitor the usage for the next couple of days, and advised me how to change my wireless password, (which I had long since forgotten.) Then sent me a text message and said to reply to it with a time they could call me if the usage was still high. On the monday it had gone up to 25.73GB so I sent a text, and someone called me back within 15 mins. He said there had been several complaints from customers about higher than usual usage and they were working on a solution. He assured me I wouldn't be charged for the excess usage, and sure enough when my bill came yesterday, there were no extra charges. BT get a lot of flack for their customer service, but on this occasion, I am very satisfied with the service I received."
btsurvivor,coventry,7/8/15,"Broadband connectivity is weak - drops out much over 10m line of sight.

The most dreadful customer service ever experienced. Only deal with BT if you're prepared to gamble on not having an issue to resolve. Be warned."

Marje,Kidderminster,7/5/15,"I recently contacted BT to complain about the amount by which my line rental had gone up. Maurice asked me what I wanted him to do! I asked him to justify a 15.5% increase on last years subscription, he muttered something about profit margins and shareholders. I was told that he could not do anything about the price, I then asked to speak to a manager and was asked ""why"", I replied that I would like to speak to someone who would not patronise. My request was refused adding that a manager could do nothing about the price, and that ""this conversation is going nowhere so I am going to terminate the call"" Maurice then promptly cut me off.

I called back and got through to someone in India, who made a note of my complaint about the rudeness of Maurice but said nothing could be done about the price increase. I was also told that if I wanted to cancel my Broadband at the end of its contract in December there would be a £30 cessation fee!!!!!!!
Forgive me but I thought that once a contract was finished, you were free to go to an alternative provider without any penalties.
Maybe someone can explain how BT can get away with increasing their prices in this time of austerity by 15.5% and how they can charge a fee AFTER the contract has finished."

The icing on the cake of course is that this month, that is 7 months into a 1 year contract BT have increased the price of the HD extra package and introduces a £5 per month charge for the free BT sport channels, the channels that were advertised as free with BT broadband. And all this while I am still within the 1 year contract. Appalling service and conduct from BT. Never have I been treated so badly. Can't wait to leave and never return."

Shakur,London,7/2/15,"I went for BT fiber optic broadband for the great service BT offered in the past. During the installation I was disappointed to learn the modem had to remain near the main socket, which was on the ground floor. I thought to myself if the speed and connection will be optimal I may not need the ethnic cable, something I used to improve the speed.

From the very start I encountered issues connecting the wifi to my devices. I noticed the password had to be re-entered each time I reset my laptop and on some occasion the password appeared unrecognised. I was then forced to retype the password several times before achieving a successful connection. This got worse overtime, after several consultations with BT technicians over the phone, the only solution I got was to reset the modem when this occurred. I was then compelled to walk to the living room from the comfort of my bedroom every other night just to connect my laptop to BT's wifi. I did not expect this poor service whilst paying premium price for the connection."
William Purcell,Featherstone,7/1/15,ever since we had broad band it's been ridiculous kept going of or would not work bt said upgrade so we did now it's a joke to get through to customer services you just get put through to somebody who can't even understand English they always say there's no manager we have had this for nearly 12 months now they promised to ring a few days later to see if things were any better but never have surely wiyh technology they should know there just fobbing people off all the time I am now looking to speak to somebody to speak to to cancel and a refund they are charging me for something I don't even get and I know quite a few people it's happened to
James,Limavady,7/1/15,"If anyone reading this wants good broadband most definitely do not go to bt, this company has left me so stressed, backing you into a coner to fix speed etc, then you get tec team telling you the copper wires are swollen cause it's warm etc etc then when i try to cancel a guy tells me if i don't pay all this money they will send the baliff in. I could go on and this is only 2 months with them."

I will never buy into a BT broadband package again!!!"
david,London,6/30/15,Just switched to BT broadband few days ago and found that the braoddband speed very slow at times and connection unreliable. By replacing the BT home hub (router) with my netgear dualband router solved all the problems.
SHANE,CO ARMAGH,6/29/15,"Not one day goes buy without having problems with connectivity. it takes an age to get speaking to someone and they then get you to test the speed wired, despite repeatedly telling them its with wifi the problem is.

Not a patch on SKY tv."
Eleni,Glasgow,6/29/15,"Initially went on a 9-month unlimited broadband package, however the bills always kept coming higher than the set contract price. After 9 months, when I called to cancel, I was told that the 9 month contract was only for Internet so we had to pay extra cancellation fees for the landline. To make matters worse, after 'cancelling' their services they supposedly took 2 weeks to process the cancellation (during which I ceased using their services as I had already moved out of the flat) yet they sent me a bill charging me for an extra month. When I called to investigate, customer services were rude and patronising. They said they'd refund me the money by deducting them from my cancellation fee and so the matter was dismissed. A week later, when my cancellation bill came through, I found that they had only deducted £1.20 from it. Appalling to say the least. I will never be returning to BT again, it was a waste of money and time."
TBbarc,Sutton,6/29/15,"Supper crab service, worst ever. We ordered the internet in last February, and got installation until April after many calls. When we moved house at the beginning of October, BT changed us 200 pounds for moving, and again took another one and half months for the reinstallation. Now we can not tolerate the slow speed, and wanted to cancel it, 100 pounds for penalty."
J McC,Co Antrim,6/29/15,My broadband speed was really poor but when I reported this to BT they sent out an engineer within 2 days and fixed the problem. This was only a few days ago and so I cant really comment on the long term but so far so good. Their customer service was excellent.
Wendy,Hertford,6/28/15,Broadband very slow to nothing weekends and evenings. Help line in India also very little help as they seem to read from check list which has nothing to do with this issue.
Usman Ali,Glasgow,6/28/15,"I have been with BT for 6 years and I am moving home at the end of June and i read on the internet about giving notice to BT one month before when moving to avoid extra charges

On the 9th of June i phoned BT asking to stop my contract at the end of the month. I confimed twice with the customer service saying i was moving out on the 30th and i needed the landline till that day, he assured it was ok and i wrote everything down.

I immediately received an email saying i was getting disconnected the day after.

So i promptly called back saying i didn't want to be disconnected the day after, they said there was nothing to do and the disconnection was on the way and there was nothing to do about it.
I begged to keep my connection as i need internet for work they ammitted their fault but they said there was nothing they could do.

The day after i got disconnected by BT and that was my landline and broadband gone.

I called BT several times and they said i would have been reconnected the day after, 3 different people assured me i was going to be reconnected, but nothing happened.

After 2 days i called back and they told me i would have to wait for the following week to be reconnected.
After that call i received an email saying i was subscribing a new 12 months contract and the reconnection fee was 50 pounds. (!!!!!!) I never asked any of that.

When the week after i finally got reconnected the internet wasn't working and i put up with being with no internet for 20 days waiting to move out. I just gave up talking to them.

A special mention goes to the customer service department, all they do is:
- asking your details
- asking to hold on while they check
- transferring your call to someone else
- asking your details again (since the new speaker doesn't know anything about you)
- asking you to hold on again while they check
- transferring you again or lying and saying everything is ok.

They have been lying to me so much about everything, the timing, fees, procedures, speaking to customer service is pointless or actually bad for you because they create troubles instead of sorting them out.

Conclusion:
- if you speak to BT the only communication you should aknowledge is the written one you receive by post or email.
Everything said on the phone is unreliable.
- if you want to cancel BT, just tell them the day before, they don't need any notice, they will charge you anyway 43 pounds for the disconnection, unless you cancel at the end of your 12 months contract.
- If you can, avoid BT at all costs."
Luke,Nottingham,6/27/15,"My review of BT is that BT is the worst internet we've ever had at my home. I got told that I'll be happy with this internet speed so I can still be happy in making my games with a fast internet connection. After 3 months they went through to floor. The worst people we've ever had to deal with. Broadband speed, Ridiculous. Customer Service, Not good. Reliability, Not good."
Tom,Mid Wales,6/27/15,"Just moved from talk talk to BT infinity 2. Bt have been brilliant only problems have been with Talk Talk, firstly in supplying incorrect MAC code then insisting they are still connected even though I am connected to BT, this is a technical impossibility. Thank you BT your engineeer was so helpful."
Denitsa,Cardiff,6/26/15,"The most appalling customer service I have ever experienced. BT disconnected my broadband by mistake and for a week now I have been going around in circles trying to establish what the cause is and having to explain myself at least 4 times on a single call being transferred across different departments. Raised a complaint which was not registered initially, so I had to ask the staff to register my complaint, which has not been taken seriously, because it has been a week since then With no update. If customer reviews make any difference to the customer experience by taking customer feedback on board, then please sort this out and make sure it doesn't happen again."
SP,Manchester,6/26/15,"Shocking service from start to finish. From getting my account set up and then corrected 5 times due to incompetent staff, being billed incorrectly numerous times and then to find that the actual amazing new Broadband BT advertise as their best ever is woeful at best. Constantly losing connection and working from home it is really annoying I can assure you! Avoid! Use pen and paper, it is more reliable and probably faster!"
Alison sealy,Dorset,6/23/15,Absolute rubbish. Changed from talk talk to bt last year signed up for totally unlimited only to find it wasn't unlimited and I went over my usage and was charged. Changed my package to totally unlimited with unlimited everything at a cost of I think it was 40 quid only to find it increasing every month I have just paid 58 quid! Don't have a clue why it is going up every month cannot log into my account to see what is going on. Also was given a different phone number which I wasn't told about so couldn't understand why no one could get hold of us I had to ring my phone from my mobile to get the new number which I did not want. Rang BT numerously and eventually got my number back after about a month. Not happy will not be renewing my contract.
Dale,Lancashire,6/23/15,"Very slow speeds at times, customer service very difficult to deal with and after several months of trying unable to resolve my issues. Will not be using ever again!!"
Frederick G Flanagan,"Winsford,Somerset",6/23/15,"We are promised up to only 7.5mb/sec.and in fact,achieved that regularly up to about 12 months ago.Now we struggle to get 1-2 mb./sec. and BT won't fix it....they keep coming back with the explanation that it's because we have 8 applications....we only ever have 2 running on wireless broadband and we had these before when the speed was ok.I want to change but as the line is provided by BT I'm unsure whether it'll make any difference except maybe for a lower cost which is not what I need.Ideas??"
Jonathan Hill,London,6/22/15,"Awful. £130 for new line.Engineer didn't do his job, gave incorrect information, couldn't get a another appointment for over a week (which i received no confirmation for), then well over 40 mins on hold to sort it out (I'm still holding). You simply cant believe what they say - I was told two different versions of why work couldn't be completed. To make it worse this is just one in a line of errors over last 6 months - constantly re-setting the wi-fi, poor ordering online, long waits on the phones and variable (being polite) customer service on the phones. DO NOT GO WITH BT."
DAVID MATTHEWS,Derbyshire,6/22/15,
Tony rowland,West sussex,6/21/15,"ordered broadband /TV 29th May for activation 4th June received text to say it was cancelled,no explanation and I would be contacted in 2 days which they did, apologised and was told it would be activated 16th June and all activation, delivery fees would be scrapped.my package included extra 20 channels
ie: fox,gold etc, another text informed me I would contacted 18th June 2 days after due activation date,
cancelled again . I contacted BT and after being sent
everywhere finally spoke to a agent in UK i explained
what was happening and he said he could reorder again
but now I would have to pay activation charges and
£10month for extra channels but I said that was not what I was offered and was told if I took the package he would add a complaint and all calls would be checked and if they proved the agent did offer me these they would refund the charges I refused this and now waiting for another call 22nd June ...not going to hold my breath"
Ellie may,London,6/21/15,"Awful! The wifi is so inconsistent and I have no connection even from my bedroom. Customer service is appalling, there are inconsiderate and rude. Keep losing connection and it takes about 10 minutes for a page to load. Don't choose BT whatever you do."
Geoff Stimson,Cambridge,6/21/15,"BT Broadband service is appalling! Emails going missing. Losing totally, inbox, outbox, all saved emails. Have needed to contact them for the past 3weeks. Today, again, emails disappearing into the ether. It takes minutes to sign in/out, Change to another email address, etc. So disappointed with the very poor broadband service. Since it combined with Yahoo it has been nothing but trouble. Ive been told that BT are slowly severing their customers from Yahoo but it could take months! Not acceptable BT. Should really change to another provider and that would kick BT up the bum. This is the 4th week and this morning it's so slow I need to wait for the service to keep up with my typing. Poor show BT you should be ashamed."
Eddie,Hampshire,6/20/15,"Broadband service reliable but much slower than advertised at my address. Customer service very poor, polite perhaps but staffed mostly by people who can do no more than read scripts. Much of the response is telephone only, i.e. no audit trail of the poor service, and if you're stuck with Yahoo mail, you may have to change your password twice a day through no fault of your own, and BT say it's not their product so tough luck."
Anne,Ardrossan,6/19/15,"Very patchy customer service. If you fall into the right category, it's not too bad, but if it's a bit complicated, then you've got no chance. For a communications company they're very difficult to get in touch with."
P Fernie,Newcastle,6/18/15,"Quite frankly useless in every way, shocking customer service, shocking reliability, even leaving these clowns is fraught with hassle. Probably the worst broadband provider in the universe"
Farrah Washash,London,6/18/15,"HORRID!!!!! NEVER EVER JOIN THEM!!!

They messed up my initial order, made me wait 11 days for a connection, connected me on the wrong rate, charged me an activation fee when they promised not to, sent me a bill for £76 pounds when it was supposed to be around £36, promised me call backs when I called to find out what is happening, wasted my time for three weeks then when I wanted to cancel my account they said I owed them money when I was only connected for five days on the wrong rate and it was all their fault!"
john scorer,Durham,6/18/15,"Shocking, made the fateful mistake in moving from Talk Talk to BT. They took the order but placed my order on pending so was not actioned on, only found out when I moved to BT. They issued me with the infinity box but the speed I have at the moment is barely recognisable on a speed test, its that slow. I thought it would be a seamless service from 1 provider to another but this is simply not the case but this is down to BT. Wish I could turn the clock back. Not impressed with BT at all."
Michael Gill,"Hebden road, Haworth",6/17/15,
Klc1980,Walton On Thames,6/17/15,"Dreadful... Took BT Sport full of excitement but hardly been able to watch anything in HD as, firstly it kept freezing and then stopped working all together. They could not solve the problem after many times trying. I then get charged £34 to cancel something I can't even use. AVOID..!"
Syed,London,6/17/15,"BT is the worst. I live in Canary wharf in London and yet it takes BT 6 days to bring internet back, which is absolutely unacceptable in year 2015"
Tatiana,Reading,6/17/15,"Absolutely shocking, terrible customer service, terrible broadband speed, not reliable at all. We didn't have proper service for 6 months and bt is just not interested."
jason,southend on sea,6/16/15,"upgraded today from standard broadband to BT you view with a new hub.I now have no internet, no tv and no back up from these idiots. How bt can be allowed to keep trading is beyond me. Every dealing I have had over the years has been appalling. scum of the earth"
mark,london,6/16/15,"awful broadband I can load google, techncial cant fix the interference and BT would let you cancel. Hours being passed around hte world requoting my phone number and address, while paying for nothing"
Fed up customer,Doncaster,6/15/15,
trevor dawson,herts,6/15/15,advised to upgrade to infinity from basic broadband to get a better speed my system is now slower than before so slow now that my pc is unusable for days at a time keep complaining but get nowhere with bt accept speak to some very nice people in india my advice is steer clear of bt infinity.
Sarah,Osborne,6/14/15,"I can't actually rate any of BT they are the biggest pile of dung i have ever come across. I'm talking years of experience. Don't bother with any of their products. The staff in India are robots and unable to deviate from their scripts. Doesn't matter how much you complain they never ever deliver what they say they are going to and then offer £5 compensation.... that is when asked they never actually offer!I can't believe in this day and age they are allowed to get away with such horrendous conduct, and they are not cheap either. Broadband doesn't work and still being charged for BT Sky 9mnths later when it could never be installed as the broadband speed is so poor won't support it. Have rung BT 5 times for a refund and they still can't sort it. Promises of manager to ring back....can never speak with one god for bid, and guess what manger never does. I've had it with them now and will be going right to the top to complain. What ever you do don't go with BT."
Gary Nixon,Nottinghamshire,6/14/15,"I have had intermittent difficulties following a horrendous set up experience of multiple no shows from BT. Most recently an excellent engineer came out and appeared to resolve the ongoing problem. However when trying to seek compensation from them for a long term problem albeit intermittent but really been unable to access on demand consistently without buffering since October 2014. Now all appears well.
I have contacted billing and have experienced the usual run around, lies about returning calls, false details recorded on the system and the last contact stated I am not likely to get any compensation because I have not complained enough and are soon to be out of contract. I have infinity, Broadband, TV.

If any one from BT Senior Management is reading this please contact me as your operatives clearly lie consistently and are malicious.

All I want is a good service - oh on reading the engineers notes - he did not know I did - his instructions were 'customer must prove fault'. well the fault was not mine and proved to be BTs. Mmmm what a premise to start off from. Really disgusted."
Susann Mitchell,,6/14/15,"Sick to the back teeth of BT and their NOT Super Fast Infinity and NOT reliable, after 5 months of trying to get this resolved I have lost the will to live. New Ofcom rule, I believe, means I can opt out without penalty"
Bush,Gloucester,6/14/15,"Home hub 5 issues for 5 months now. No usable wifi. BT service apalling, In over 20 phones calls not once have I spoken to UK call centre despite asking in every call to speak with a UK manager. Have been lied to multiple times."
Ian,Bolton,6/12/15,"The worst isp ever! I regularly have huge problems connecting. Download speed is appalling. Customer service really don't care about your problems. When your due an upgrade you have to fight tooth and nail for them to even give you one. I had to threaten to leave my contract before they would even listen to me. And to top it all off they have blocked websites so the freedom of browsing is lost with BT, absolutely useless as soon as my contract is over I'm defiantly leaving. I'd get a better deal using a wet fish!"
Julie,derby,6/11/15,Utter rubbish. Made the mistake of signing up to BT infinity. The only thing infinite about this service is the length of time you have to wait for the page to load or my iPad to sense the weak signal. Dial up was faster. Looking for a new service provider. BT can keep it.
PK,LEICESTERSHIRE,6/11/15,"Had to use bt for broadband when moving house because others could not move my phone number. Then paid full price for 12 months for 0.7 mbit/ sec broadband when it worked at all. Then I called them and signed up for 12 month contract for slow dsl at a discounted rate. The same week they announced that fibre was finally available.
They are willing to sign me up for new fibre contract but I pay the full rate which is twice the discounted rate because I am not a new customer.
Bt discust me. They are still a monopoly and behave like one. Of course other companies also do not want to keep existing customers, but I am complaining about bt right now."
Esther Edwards,Pembrokeshire,6/10/15,"AVOID! Most useless, unreliable company I have ever come across! My BT infinity was installed over 6 months ago, 2 engineer call outs and numerous phone calls later it's still not working properly! They offered me a £100 cash back as a gesture of good will! Even though I've paid over £45 a month for the past 6 months!! They have made my blood boil! USELESS"
Ben,Droitwich Spa,6/10/15,"Good Speed. INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE RELIABILITY, appalling customer service."
Charlie,Adam,6/9/15,It is a matter of fact that BT is the worst company in the UK. They do not provide anything close to a good service. When you have a problem they will lie and lie for weeks until they fix it. Customer service people are morons who don't right down any information you give them so you end up repeating yourself a thousand times in the space of 2 days and for all this pleasure you pay more than most other broadband companies around. Only reason BT is still around is because they gain all their money from line rentals. Without this they would have gone bust a long time ago.
Marcus1212,Leeds,6/9/15,"What a rude disgusting company but really are. Cut off the phone 7 times. Broadband that has the slowest speed and after moving from Virgin due to a new build property not being able to get Virgin I'm at my wits end with bt.

After many phone calls to bt I have been no option but writer this review as full confirmation I've now cancelled my service .an utterly disgusting e periwnce and one I do not wish participate again. I've exhausted every avenue and now but are trying to charge for cancelling our contract when the services are not fully working. Bt now have thus blamed the new build property for the slow speed."

Sonya,Bedfordshire,6/8/15,"Terrible service - do not recommend. If you are also having or have had issues contact Watchdog. The more people that do, the more likely we can get their appalling service brought into the limelight. Day 7 and still no broadband and still no date for reconnection. Once again i am left with extra fuel costs and childcare costs by needing to work from the office. No call from BT, had to chase them - 2 emails not responded to and a phonecall. Managed eventually to speak to the 'bored' sounding executive customer support person, and told they will call me tomorrow when they have more information.

Update 5th June - day 4 with no business broadband - called back from customer services, the same issue persists, the engineers have not closed their part so the new order cannot be raised. But I'm assured it has now been escalated to the responsible team...only took 4 days to decide to do this! And 'hopefully' it will be closed today, so that the new order can go through on Monday and 'hopefully' some time next week I will receive the internet service (although they cannot promise) that mine and my partners business desperately need back again. Needless to say after this weeks saga I am not holding my breath. Please anyone about to write a poor review - share also with WATCHDOG. In the hope that getting BT to review their full processes rather than trying to fix individual issues will provide future customers with a better service.

Update 4th June - can it get any worse? Seems it can! After cancelling my broadband in error, and still on day 3 having made no progress to reorder. It (remember I'm supposedly on an enhanced business service), has just become worse when I came in from work to a bill for over £500 they are going to debit from my account in a few days. It appears this is payment for my unused contract liability seeing as my account has been cancelled WHICH I DID NOT REQUEST! So now I'm expected to pay hundreds for their error and I STILL HAVE NO BROADBAND and currently no hope! PS, BT man I spoke to about invoice said he'd seen a lot of these 'changovers' going wrong, and account closures that shouldn't happen!

June 2nd - My company provided my work line and internet through BT, and following a company change asked employees to arrange their own providers and we would be subsequently subsidised. Let's keep this simple I thought, let's remain with BT, and just ask for everything to be switched to my name. WRONG choice! I was passed from department to department none of which seemed to know how I could switch to my name - passed from business to residential (times that by 3 or 4). Eventually I ffound someone who seemed to know, convinced me a business account would be better and she would arrange it all, including an upgrade to infinity. Long story short, upgrade hasn't happened, broadband has been cut off despite a call to them after I received a letter warning it would be cut off, and their subsequent reassurance this wouldn't happen, and now evidentally I need to wait 2 to 5 days to be reconnected. I am livid right now, and I'm unable to work. Assoon as I'm back online will be looking at how I can cancel my BT contract due to the POOR service. The only positive is my phone still works, although they managed to get a bill out to me, including 28 pound to move the account to my name and 4 pound payment charge whatever that is, sounds like they are charging me to bill me!! Really in 2015, can companies still remain this bad, with one department not knowing what the next is doing? And all this on a supposedly enhanced business service, I pity anyone on residential! Anyone considering BT, please rethink."
Steve T,Chislehurst,6/8/15,"Bill a day late=pestering calls through the night. Broadband speed not as it should be. Drops out often. Complaints with BT only compensated if you stay with them, if not nothing. Staff in general unhelpful and sometimes rude to the paying customer. Hard to understand the Indian accents, avoid this company if you like quality"
Ron,Co. Down,6/6/15,It took BT three months and one day to connect my BB. Offered me £9 in compensation. Operate like a garden shed business and wash hands of you even when it's their serial incompetence at fault. Now taking them to court.
Tegan,England,6/5/15,"i have to say i am disgusted with the service i received. i decided to change from Virgin back to BT and placed an order for a new BT package on the 12th of April. this package induced BT entertainment, BT sport a HD package and an extra box for my daughters room. the BT engineer came a week later and firstly only installed the main box. according to him there was no record of the extra box. furthermore i had none of the extra channels i ordered. i let this pass however because he explained to me that it could take 24 hours for the channels to come down. i have waited 6 days and i still do not have any extra channels i ordered. it isn't simple the fact that i don't have the channels but the way it has been handled is utterly appalling. i phoned BT and explained my situation and was told that my order had been cancelled, eventually i was told it was a technical error that had deleted my orders, so me begin me thought well cant you just get them back. but no i have been going round and round in circles for days now being passed from person to person, getting hung up on. i was told that i would have everything by the 3rd of June.... it is now the 5th and i still have nothing. i am sick and tired of constantly explaining myself to people i just want the channels that i will be paying for. furthermore the intensive to get BT was a £150 Sainsburys voucher which i fear i will not get."
Karen,Maidenhead,6/5/15,Things were going okay until we tried to move house and take BT Infinity with us. Placed the order then they cancelled it with no reason given. Been trying to get it reconnected for a week and counting each day staff spin some story of it will be connected tonight and of course nothing happens. They make it as hard as possible to complain and never keep a record of what you've already said so each time you have to repeat yourself.
Fiona,Scott,6/3/15,
William,London,6/3/15,"The smoothest setup I've ever had, 4x faster than my old broadband and 1/2 the cost (no exaggeration).

I've gotten the exact speeds advertised, if not more."
Shane Parkins,Durham,6/2/15,"If these stars went to minus numbers it would be infinity, their customer service is rubbish and service is worse. We have been waiting for broadband for 3 weeks and still not been told what is happening. 7 hours on the phone, 5 engineer visits, 5 call backs which have never happened. We have been with them for about 3 years, change - do not go with them."
Mark singleton,Preesall Hill,6/1/15,"Grim grim, grim customer service, speed way below what was promised, and a seemingly incurable fault that prevents me from registering my username. 1998 Dial up was better"
Mark Singleton,Poulton le fylde,6/1/15,"Dreadfull . . . switched over from aol after 17 years so I could take advantage of the free BT sport. system Input error cross referenced my account with another 12 miles away, hour after hour wasted trying to sort it with a useless foreign call centre.
Can't log in to BT, verify my id, use wi fi or tv ten days after the event of wasting over £55 in set up fees, told by a muppet this morning I have to wait up to 10 working days for my complaint to be handled.
Did a speed check, upload -30% below lowest parameter promised and down load -25%
BT should not be allowed to tout for trade offering a system with such shoddy customer service when something is amiss. To say I'm DISSAPOINTED with them is a massive understatement."
Ann McKee,Rugby,5/30/15,We have BT Infinity. The time it takes to load is very disappointing. The adverts on the BT homepage cause problems as they take ages to load but we cannot choose not to have them. Also BT charges top whack to its faithful customers while giving new customers special rates.
David,Wandsworth,5/30/15,"Switched over to BT broadband from Sky.They couldn't manage to get the service working for 3 weeks! They eventually did and 1 month later it broke down again, have been waiting one month to resolve this with hours spent in the phone 3 engineer visits, who seem to come and leave without ringing the bell or calling before filling out their notes saying unable to gain access. So many promised call backs that don't materialise. It's total incompetence. Never been provided with such a shocking service in my life"
daniel,london,5/27/15,"Pathetic service. Constantly drops, poor speed. Takes forever to connect. Always had payment issues they cut our connection a few months in a row even though we had paid due to thier incompetence to manage accounts. Is this 2015? How can you live in one of the largest cities on earth and get such poor internet."
Alex,Uk,5/26/15,"To me, BT is a stupid company. If there is no star I will choose no star.
First, every charge is so expensive but the service is extremely bad. For example,the normal payment per month is £45 something even I didn't use any calls. The speed of the network is not quick under this price.
Secondly, the company is overcharge. Once a time, my phone line is broken. Then I phoned the BT customer service I asked the adviser how much of the line need to be fixed. The adviser said maybe just £20 on and off. But I am shocked when I got the bill, the engineer fee is £120 something even the engineer just work less then half an hour , just fixed the broken iron wire. And also I think the company did't say clearly what is international call freedom on the contract. For example,I pay £6 per month but I always need to £10-15 per month for the international call.
These are two major bad feelings to me so far, all the say I am extremely not happy with this service experience. I think BT is the big broadband company in the uk, even over the city, whey they do such bad service. They should spend time and ideas to improve the service, not how to earn more money from the customers. I want to leave this company now, but I cannot because the contract hasn't been finished. If I want to leave I need to pay £ 200 to cancel the contract. So I have to stay with it. I will definitely leave this company and won't use it any more.

Thank you"
Poppy,East Sussex,5/25/15,"BT are completely useless, and I would most definitely NOT recommend them. After purchasing fibre optic broadband, we had frequent problems with loss of connection. This went on for almost a year.I spent hours upon end contacting BT about the problem. Every time I phoned it was answered by someone in India, and invariably they cannot always understand what you are saying. I was fobbed off with many different reasons for the problem and many different solutions, none of which worked. Eventually it was established that the installation had been done incorrectly and an engineer was sent out to correct it. I asked for some reimbursement and suggested three months worth of the cost of the broadband, totalling approx £75.00. All they would give me was £10.00, and that took a lot of persuading. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with."
Peter kar,wolverhampton,5/24/15,Don't even try to switch or sign up for BT... They robbed you... Internet is crap and TV is worst than crap.. You might get 3 channels for 70£... If you want 50 channels than you have to pay at least 500£ a month.... Best think is when you try to cancel contract with BT... Haha I leave that for you people to experience that ...
james mcnaughten,norfolk,5/23/15,"I have never come across a worse utility company in my life!!! Lies, incompetence, total disregard by staff who care not a jot for you as a customer but, only for themselves and BT. Im self employed and have lost thousands of pounds in lost work since telling them about a house move in january. Eight failed attempts to connect my land line, my computer goes down every time i now use my t/phone and nearly £1,000 taken from my bank account after already speaking with billing and getting an assurance from them that I actually owed ZILCH, I have since stopped paying by direct debit. If you have serious complaints, and I have only scratched the service here, they will lead you down the garden path, hoping you will eventually give up. Go straight to the ombudsman and tell all your friends to never use such a deceitful, inept, CON-firm"
brian w,"peebles, scotland",5/22/15,"Moved to BT Infinity from Sky's std broadband. Expected big increase in speed. None noticeable. None achieved - despite spending a few hours on the phone. Connection sped averages around 20 Mb with download similar and upload around 4.5 Mb, as confirmed by BT's own speed checker. Will move as soon as the contract ends. BEWARE THEIR SPEED CLAIMS AS THEY'VE NOT DELIVERED THEM FOR ME!"
mark rice,london,5/22/15,"bt are just greedy money grabbers ,i got charged £250 + vat to move a wire inside the door frame ,it was done shody by a previous bt engineer yet they still charged me for it ,beware when reporting faults, i am still fighting it ."
David Carter,"Newark, Nottinghamshire",5/21/15,"I've never felt so ripped off, Broadband Infinity 2 drops out about 10 times a day... BT took £50 from us as without warning for a ""deposit"" and we have to wait 6 months to get it back... It's supposed to be £38 a month and it ends up being closer to £50 for no reason... generally crap, cant wait to leave."
KTW,Uk,5/21/15,"Gave my 30 days notice to cancel BT sports, they cut the service the next day owing me 29 days service, which I had paid for, spoke to a guy who told me he was re- instating the 29 days, sounds great, but he did not tell me he was setting up a new account with all the activation costs involved and would credit my account with some compensation, no money appeared, surprise surprise, glad I had cancelled my DD, they tried to take an activation fee and subscription for £43...they owed me 29 days service that had already been paid for .... Disgraceful, I will stick with sky sports from now
on.....do not bother with BT..."
Muriel scott,Lancashire,5/20/15,"Regarding my review yesterday, thanks to bt technical support, my problem is now solved, so thank you. If anyone else is having trouble with wifi on a smart set, bt sent me two bt extender kits, one for the TV, and one to attach to the bt hub four. The technical support team are excellent."
HANNAH,BUCKINGHAMSHIRE,5/20/15,"The most disgusting customer service I have ever experienced. I moved from talk talk thinking that BT had better service and it would make my life easier, what a mistake that was. I was offered a £10 a month contract when I joined but was charged £23 a month in the first month. I have now since spent a month making hours and hours of phone calls trying to resolve this issue, only to be accused of being a lier, on several occasions, by there very poorly trained customer service team based in India who said that I wasn't offered this contract. I have been told on four occasions that someone would call me back which has never happened, and even when I eventually got confirmation that I am on a £10 a month contract, I got a call the next day to say that I wasn't again, and once again accused of making it up. I am so furious I have reported it to trading standards. I cannot stress enough STAY AWAY FROM BT."
Tat,London,5/20/15,Indian office needs education in IT at least to support somehow for now they just sitting there and talking nonsense to people. Every month I have to book an engineer appointment because of connections drops. Worst thing they trying to cover it with Openreach when they are the ones who are useless. People if you have any other offer then BT choose it.
Mark,Chester,5/20/15,"The worst broadband order I've ever experienced.

I was assured by the BT sales team that an order placed ahead of a flat move would be fine & they'd transition the change of line over without issue, but that original order had to be cancelled 'due to a technical error'. All without informing us of an issue.

My next order, after moving, also didn't complete automatically so was passed to 'first line assist' where it has been for a further week.

So 2 weeks after moving, 3 weeks after originally ordering I've not been contacted to explain the issue or has the issue been resolved. I'm getting tired of calling them to hear the same response."

Emily,Scotland,5/15/15,"This is the worst company I have ever dealt with, I am now at 5 weeks with no internet and have been told just to sit and 'Wait'. The customer services in Dundee are usless and have an attitude that needs to be addressed. Will be cancelling as soon as I can."
brian aaron,longfield,5/14/15,"Bt ithe worst company I have ever dealt with. Their Broadband Help Line Operatives every time I phoned, listen have you do checks confirm the speed you said you had,and do nothing.After 3 weeks of hell numerous phone calls my Infinity 2 speed was still 12Mb/sec. I gave up and am now on a different provider with 50mb/sec. BT useless and I advise every one to move."
Mark illingworth,Parbold,5/13/15,"I have now been with bt broadband for total of 2 weeks, switching from sky. It has been the biggest mistake of my life, the home hub 4 is the biggest piece of dung outthere. Never have I had so my devices drop out and stop working. No AirPlay, no remote app for I iTunes, no control of kodi over wifi and a signal strength half that of a basic sky hub. My sainsburys vouchers are now having to be spent on air port extreme. (What ever the deals is it's not worth swapping)"
Jack,London,5/13/15,"This has been a NIGHTMARE from the word go.

Messed about for a month to even set up basic broadband, misled on phone regarding availability of 'Infinity' in my area. Told by two separate customer service agents that I would be getting the upgraded Infinity for no extra charge. It was then cancelled without my asking and RESOLD to me over the phone by another agent that misled me to believe I was getting a special deal because of how I'd been treated!! One visit to the website made me realise that it was a standard package for existing customers!

I have now been trying to set up BT Sport (the ONLY reason I went with BT in the first place...) for over a week. Speaking to people every day over Twitter, over text, over the phone... '8pm tomorrow', doesn't happen, I get back in touch...'12 midnight tomorrow', doesn't happen! 'After the weekend, 8pm Monday'... still NO BT SPORT!?

Then the EMAILS!! Multiple emails saying the same thing 'your order has been recieved', then saying the service had been cancelled, then saying the standard TV package had been ordered....I've been using that for a few weeks already... 8 emails today!!!

Confused yet?? I am."
Sam,Maidstone,5/13/15,"It's quite difficult to give a review about BT broadband because it's incredible inconsistent. You will get great speed at one point then painfully slow the next day. It's not reliable, seems to go down everyday around 1:45 and in the evening around 9:30/11pm and then it might disappear at random points in the week when it feels like it.

Haven't used their customer service so have no opinion, I hear it's pretty good though."
Mole,London,5/12/15,"It is impossible to say how bad BT is. Think of the worst service you have ever gotten, then try to imagine something worse."
Ian,Felixstowe,5/10/15,"Have had 23 engineers, many promises to fix things and been dealing with England's resolution centres and the highest person responsible to the CEO of BT.
I'm still being lied to , being treated like an idiot and this week was told I had the plug in the hub in the wrong place!!!
Broadband has been a joke and BT have been the worst people to deal with that I've ever encountered.
Even the top complaints office tells lies promise to ring and don't . It's 8 months on and the fault in the line discovered after 5 different engineers looked for it is still waiting to be repaired.
The resolution centres are so busy with complaints that the people you speak to seem to be against me because I've complained.
Never get broadband or phone from BT they are a shambles that couldn't give a dam about their customers."
Jonny B,Cambridgeshire,5/10/15,"I moved house a year ago where I was on 125MB Virgin Broadband, it worked like a dream. I've been forced to pay BT as they're the only provider where I am at the moment and it's disgraceful. Currently paying for ""up to"" 17MB... I see they use that phrase to cover their backs because I consistently get 2-3MB. My family can't do anything if we're on at the same time. They recently upgraded the village I'm at but have left the one exchange that connects my street, so for the last two months everyone else has been able to upgrade to fiber optic and we're still in the technological stone age! Emailed them to ask when the exchange would be upgraded and got a standard, copy-paste response from some customer service representative who has no appreciation for their job.

If you can get another provider, do it. BT will only bring you frustration."
Sharon Embarold,London,5/9/15,
Paul Smith,Lancashire,5/9/15,
Sophie,Essex,5/9/15,We have had BT Internet for at least a year now and all we get is slow internet and expensive bills for not only the internet but they are charging us for the telly which we have never had and we have explained we don't want to pay for something we don't have but they don't listen and put the phone down on us all the time. They will rob you off your money. The Internet isn't even that good it cuts out 24/7. I would never ever reccomend BT unless you want to pay out lots of money every month for things you shouldn't have to! Rude staff aswell!
Kris,Aberdeen,5/8/15,"I've been with BT for the past 18 months. BT infinity 2. To be honest it was rather brilliant, beside the price. Initially had some problems to get my Sainsbury voucher but eventually got it and it had promised 100 pounds on it. Broadband was reliable - never had any drops in connection and after setting the router properly I stopped having issues with iPhone connection etc. Router broke once, but I was offered another one in no time. Overall I was very satisfied but I'm gonna leave them because of the price."
Brett,Congleton,5/8/15,"Moved into new property, ordered BT infinity 2 months before moving in, then had to wait another 58 days with no broadband or phone, BT eventually connected us to broadband, and we got a max speed of 2 mb/s 2 weeks later go infinity, and that is a max of 12 mb/s.

BT are trying to charge us for Infinity when we only get broadband speeds, they take money out of out bank account with out notice.Customer service is non existent was with virgin before BT are the worst company I have ever dealt with. They promise speeds they can no do and when you complain use the old distance from exchange excuse.
Believe non of there blurb its all untrue, Open reach are a disgrace and hide behind we are not customer facing story.

BT are a total disgrace to the country,If you are after broad band stay away from BT and Open reach if you can."

Noel,London,5/7/15,Absolute rubbish in terms of service. BT keep putting my monthly broadband payments up every couple of months. For an example one month I can be paying £38 and the next £65. I have contacted them numerous times in regards to this. I have an unlimited package and I do not use the landline so I do not expect my monthly payments to be fluctuating like this. I have 4 months left on my 18 month contract and then i'm leaving! I cannot wait!
G,Hampshire,5/7/15,"In December I had a BT salesperson call me about changing to a different package, as I'm not the account holder I don't have permission to change the package and also turned them down saying I wanted to stay on the current package. In January I received my BT bill which was unreadable due to prices here and discounts there, when my February bill arrived I found the package had changed. I phoned BT to complain and get the original package that we had re-instated to be told that I was not the account holder and I was not authorised to make any changes. The complaint was never registered and it took 3 months of calls to get back to the original package. I've now left BT and will never return."
pete,derbyshire,5/6/15,i have been a bt custermer for 20 years and will never go back to them thay are very good at riping u off thay reduse your bill then next thing u no thay saying u not paying anough and u owe them £100 and u havent even used the phone all thay good for is riping u off
Graham,London,5/5/15,"Changed from standard BT to ""fast"" Infinity a few months ago. Immediately slower, and in contrast to phone salesman's statement that the ""deal"" would cost the same, I got taken off a cheap evening rate to a cheap weekend rate only. Online support was friendly and helpful, but ultimately it made no difference to low speed despite two complaints. Line reliability seemed to fall slightly. Luckily, it doesn't affect me too badly, but it annoys visitors."
bob,london,5/4/15,
Sara Lant,Sonerset,5/2/15,"Appalling customers service from the moment I upgraded my package in Nov 2014. Mistake after mistake, given the wrong information regarding my gift card. Had to raise two complaints with BT both of which said no to gift card, then when I raised with ombudsman suddenly BT listened to my calls and oh after all I was entitled to my voucher. This process took approx 3 months to sort.

My account was also set up incorrectly and I was billed for services I had cancelled then my monthly direct debit plan wasn't set up and I ended up on a quarterly plan having over £200 taken out without warning as my account had been set up on paperless billing (I hadn't requested this).

As a result of this I have now accumulated a large debit balance on my account. In several occasion I have come home to find my service disconnected without receiving any warning. Every time I ring I end up having a very lengthy conversation and am assured that if I set up an agreement to pay of the outstanding balance by July then my services will not be affected actin. Despite this my services have still been disconnected without warning despite me keeping to the agreement. Each time a lengthy call to BT has been involved.

The customer service I had received has been dreadful from start to finish. I have requested that my package be cancelled but it appears BT can treat their customers however they like but they still have no right to cancel as they are under contact. What about BTs contract to provide me with good customer service.?

At no point have I received an apology or an offer of compensation for the time I have had to waste as a result of the poor service I have received from BT.

I am currently in the process of looking into the matter with the assistance of OFCOM and the ombudsman.

I will make my views known in appropriate services because to be honest I have heard the same complaints from many other people. I certainly won't be recommending BT or using them again. The end of my contact can't come soon enough!"
stan green,essex,5/1/15,"Terrible broadband, got worse and worse over 6 months until it totally stopped. Que the start of a week of phonecalls to india, struggling in vain to get my point across and being asked to carry out the same trouble shooting steps again and again. Eventually they conceded I needed a new home hub and asked for £45 for the privilege or a 12 month renewal, well that wasn't going to happen I'm pleased to get away. this was the 2 time something like this has happened with BT and I won't be giving them another chance."
Jason Timmons,Sheffield,5/1/15,"Bad speeds, cuts off every weekend for hours at a time, whenever we ring up they just say its our fault and send another modem that never helps with the problem."
Rosario,London,4/30/15,"I needed to close my account as we had an eviction notice and we are all leaving the house (which needs workings and no one else will live there).
The account is in my name but was shared by 4 people and is too expensive for me to move it. I called 2 times asking how much I would've faced to stop the contract earlier and I've been told £30, both times. Based on that I took my decision and called the third time to close it. Surprisingly I've been asked £93, from an advisor that started to explain how stupid I was to leave BT, checking my private usage, and not being helpful at all.

I closed and called on another moment. I was asked £130 this time. I asked to speak to a manager to explain the situation but my request was denied.

I opened an official complain and received an email which told me they would've call me back in 48, maximum 96 hours.
After 144 hours nobody has got in contact with me.

Who called, instead, was the office for payments as I cancelled the direct debit.
He put me through other 3 people, one of them was more like a robot than a person, not able to conversate with me, since I finally closed the account.

Now I face a massive bill for an house where there are not people living in and where I cannot even access anymore.

BT makes you a fool, doesn't care about the situation, and has not will to help you in any way."
jane,hampshire,4/29/15,"Took a new contract with BT as moved to a new area. Previously with virgin media who were excellent. No virgin media services in new area. 3 weeks into bt contract, affinity 1 , signal drops all the time, loss of internet, takes ages to watch or download anything, upon contacting them went through all the relevant checks on the phone and told all is working as it should. It is not! Absolute crap , and now stuck in a contract that does not deliver what it states on the tin! There are so many unhappy customers on here.... Bt need to pull their act together. What can we do as consumers please, there must be more that we can do."
Dave Taylor,"Farnham, Surrey",4/28/15,
David,Cheltenham,4/28/15,"BT-ARE-ATROCIOUS. It took BT two months to install infinity broadband in my house. Once it was installed it was good, it could handle four reasonably heavy users without slowing the speed. Unfortunately...the honeymoon period ended after 2 months....Broadband light went red. Been onto customer service multiple times, they have no clue....""have you checked the wires are connected?""......this question is the limits of their fault diagnosis. ""Sir, the line will be live by 6pm the next day""......nope.....""I'm sorry Sir, it may take a bit longer, please reset your box by midnight tomorrow when the line will be live""......nope....""I will send an engineer out to look at your connection, he will arrive on Tuesday between 8am - 1pm""..........nope.......""I'm sorry, I noted down your contact mobile number down wrong, the engineer could't contact you on Tuesday"".....but nobody has knocked...""An engineer will be out on Friday to fix your line"".....I'm losing the will to live here. I don't think he is coming on Friday and even if he does he is only going to check that I've plug in the box and connected the internet cable. I wish I had plusnet in my life right now, yes they may not be as fast but they were damn good are providing an internet connection which is something I value highly with my internet provider. I genuinely cannot wait to celebrate the day when BT are out of my life. Godspeed."
Jon,Leeds,4/28/15,"Avoid BT at all cost for your Broadband.
I echo the majority of the below reviews. Intermitten connection, no connection, slow speeds when actually connected.
Tried in vein over 5+ hours worth of calls to resolve and rectify. Transferred from department to department and technical explaining the same issue to different people with nobody able to know how to fix the problem. No call backs, no resolution, just a complete pain in the backside. Love the adverts at the moment about being the most reliable, surely they should be brought to justice under false advertising."
John Batten,Leicester,4/28/15,"I went with BT in July of last year, with fibre new in my area, I was keen to upgrade to superfast broadband. I went with BT, because I thought SKY needed some competition, and was keen to see the rugby. Almost immediately, it performed worse than SKY which was on snail broadband 5Mb. The internet programs were impossible to watch in HD and only just passable (sometimes). I called their helpline and was told that they would send an engineer, but if my equipment was faulty they would charge me £120. I told them politely that a contract works both ways and if they did not send an engineer FOC, I would cancel my contract. Success, they said they would send an engineer FOC.
Well after giving me a two hour window for the engineer 7.00am to 9.00am, he still managed to be 20 minutes late. He took out his little tv gadget device and plugged it into the input. ""Your signal is good"" he says. ""What is the problem then?"" I ask. ""I don't know"" he says. "" I thought you were an engineer"" says I, "" it must be the BT box then, can you test it?"". ""no, sorry"" he says.
As you can imagine this engineer, isn't an engineer at all, he is someone of the street, given a box and shown how to plug it in. After several unsuccessful phone calls, I decided to unplug my BT box and watch HD channels on my old SKY box. Although I cannot watch BT sport, it worked out OK, because Leicester Tigers had a crap year and lost most of their games anyway. Its an ill wind that blows no good at all :-)."
Chris,London,4/27/15,"Absurdly slow internet speeds which constantly cuts out for hours at a time.

Do not go with BT, especially if you live in London."
Dominic,London,4/27/15,Worst company I have ever dealt with. I suggest they drop the 'British' from their title as they are an embarrassment to the country!
John King,Faringdon,4/25/15,"Infinity was all easy enough to understand and set up but proved to drop out more frequently than the old BT router. I decided I wanted to switch back to it but two emails sent within the allowable cancellation time went unanswered and unacknowledged. Left me feeling frustrated and annoyed. Not sure yet where I'm going with it. Naturally one can't extrapolate from my experience to generalise about the service but I hope it will make some thinking of going for Infinity learn more about it than I did, before jumping.
P.s. Ironically the 'webpage wasn't available' when I tried to submit this review!"
Marcin,Sheffield,4/25/15,I went from Virgin to BT and I have regretted it ever since. I can't wait for my contract to expire so I can get my broadband from somewhere else.RUBISH !
alaa,acton,4/25/15,Bad service bad customers services its the bad company in UK I have to much to say
Marcin,Sheffield,4/24/15,I went from Virgin to BT and I have regretted it ever since. I can't wait for my contract to expire so I can get my broadband from somewhere else. Rubish !
Maria Barker,Hutton Rudby,4/22/15,Since we upgrade to BT infinity the broadband internet connection became worst. On our old package it has been slightly faster than infinity which doesn't sound normal at all. The connection speed always seems to become insanely slower from time to time. With the older package it didn't do this as much.
Paul,Bovington Dorset,4/21/15,"BT have been absolutely Rubbish. I made the order before i moved home, when we got to our new home, they was no landline or broadband. I had to reorder and wait 11 days. I need internet and landline for my work. Eventually I got it and for compensation they offered me £3. I spend more money on petrol to go to and internet cafe. DONT USE BT GO TO ANOTHER PROVIDER."
Brian,Blackburn,4/19/15,"Where do I start, BT are a complete shambles. I only live just outside of a major town but the best they can give me is 2 meg. I dont want to pay more for FTC as I think this will be crap as well. At present the superb technological giant of BT can manage to deliver is 0.5m. I have had endless calls to their customer help desk, a singular example of an oxymoron if ever there was one. I have had visits from engineers, I have had new routers, in the end somebody at BT with an IQ bigger than their hat size could work out that its their stupid copper phone line we might get somewhere. Unfortunately they seem to busy escalating it to another team who wont call you at the agreed time and even worse will still not do anything about the issue. I think we couls all club together and send the CEO of BT a torch and a mirror because thats the only way he/she could find there own backside."
C carr,Chelmsford,4/17/15,"Hopeless, charge the earth after promising the universe. I give up. We live 5 mile from Chelmsford where Marconi did magnificent things with radio but we can't get 1 meg from this crap company BT. But they get our money no probs. do not use BT at any cost. Rip off, rip Bt."
tahsin,High Wycombe,4/17/15,"This is what i had to say to Bt myself - ""So for the past 6 months, our internet service was terrible, we called your people about 50 times throughout this entire 6 months, and it had absolutely no effect on the performance of our internet and throughout time it has only gone worse. They've tried everything from resetting the hub to changing settings of the hub, to last resort of changing the entire hub, only to find out that its not the hub that's at fault its actually your service. It is not only wifi, it is the main line itself, as not only every single device in the house that uses wifi (even the new tablet i purchased the other day) but whatever connection that's coming from the mains it is terrible, because the stability is the worst i've had out of any internet service provider and i will definitely be switching to Sky or virgin after our contract runs out, i mean this is absolutely outrageous, the internet itself is not always at top speed, there are rare cases and times when the internet speed works at a speed that can't even be said to be satiable, the number of times the connection drops is probably more than the number of grain of sand there is at the beach; within this last 1 and a half years. I've absolutely had it with Bt. They've given me no compensation, when asked for help they were of no use and made no difference to the connection speed, only by chance there was one case out of the 50 times i've called them that the internet speed went up by 1m/b on the speed test and the guy went all happy, only later during that day the speed dropped by 5mb, and during most of the time the internet speed is the absolute worst, i mean i can't even load a simple youtube video, or in most cases the internet just stops working, i get the screen ""no connection"" on my browser, and this is not only my computer, like i said, there's about 4 of us in our family, each of us owns at least two devices and we all drop connection when this happens, now you may say that it may be due to the traffic in our own house, well here's another thing, even when they gave us a new hub the other day, this means that most of the devices weren't registered to it, i did a speed check and it was as awful as it was before, and there's no way i can stand this terrible internet. Like i said, its not even about the speed most of the time, its about how unstable it is, the internet connection just drops and some times it takes a solid 30-45 mins before it is back and i have to say this is absolutely not worth a single penny considering i'm paying 54 pound a month which is outrageous as i can easily get google fibre with that money and that can go to speed of up to 1gbps, i don't know if this is with every area or just my area or everywhere else in the country, but i know one thing, that Bt internet is the absolute worst i've ever had and i never plan to go back to it, one of the biggest mistakes of my life. """
A.Butler,Troon,4/16/15,Excellent speed and 100% reliability
pascal,london,4/15/15,Very unpredictable for it's price. I was on Virgin before and it was so much better. Being able to log into BT with FON wireless networks away from home has been usful but at home the wifi keeps stopping.
bruce,north finchley,4/15/15,"bt landline was faulty in october 2014, called the customer service center, they said will send an engineer to fix it, did not say they will charge me, i think it is part of BT service, engineer came 2 days later, he came in, put his tool bags on the floor, and then, his phone was ringing, he answered the phone, i knew he is talking about his private thing after few seconds, guess what, he was talking on the phone for more than 30 mins. he said may be the cable is worn,(he did not say why), he said need replace new cable, i said i had a spare cable(i have 2 lines before, cancelled one), he just rewire the spare cable to the socket, then did something in the BT greenbox, then it is done, he spent no longer then 15 mins. i received a bill it is 445 pound, 115 for the engineer call out,330 for his work, 110 pound an hour!!! i also need pay him talking phone, it is ridiculous."
phil,york,4/14/15,Avoid at all point. I'm with BT infinity 2 supposed to get 76 Mb and it is very very slow slower than my old cable ADSL!
M Foreman,Norfolk,4/13/15,"Fail, fail, fail. According to BT, Openreach was to blame (not BT!) when we requested our new house be connected. 2 weeks in, we await a case review in 2 weeks time to tell us when we might get connected. Told it could be up to 5 months, despite being the last house on the development. We rely on this for work as well as leisure. Time to end their outdated monopoly. Will change providers as soon as current contract ends. No means to complain to Openreach directly."
Luke,,4/13/15,"i had been with BT for 4 months, and have had so much hassle and stress with Customer Service reps in all parts of the world. Engineers turning up to my properties under the influence of a Class B drug. also non stop on the phone with Managers not being able to resolve my issues and troubles with their services
1. Bt Broadband on and off - had 4 engineers out to assist couldn't fix the problem to then find out that they hadnt activated my line!!!! then they couldn't refund me the days weeks i had no internet~!!!!!
i could go on for ever about BT bad service but would just advise news customers to not go with them and look further. i payed £281.98 pence to cancel their services and was ask to send back there equipment which was shambolic considering i had to pay for installation and the delivery p&p fee!!!!!!!"
Damian,Staffordshire,4/11/15,"I went from Virgin to BT and I have regretted it ever since. I can't wait for my contract to expire so I can get my broadband from somewhere else. My broadband speed has gone from 31Mb/s to 400kb/s. BT Sport is absolutely appalling. There is no catchup option online and you cannot pause online coverage. This is unacceptable compared to all other TV providers. Not that it makes much difference as the picture is so terrible, it's unwatchable. I am not new to this. I have been watching online TV since it was first developed and I was a part of the test recipients for both the BBC iPlayer and 4OD, and BT Sport is worse then both of these even in their development stages all those years ago. There is no point in complaining to BT, they simply don't care."
M Walker,Fishcross,4/9/15,"We orderd BT infinity at start of March. As we were existing customers we were given a dearer price than a new customer, but our problem which BT knew about from the installation , was our slow broadband speed. It was incredibly difficult to make myself understood when I complained and the person would promise to phone back at a certain time and date and then never phoned. We had a second engineer in to check the line, although I had succinctly explained the problem was with our distance away from the fibre. And then although the second engineer had told my husband exactly the same as the first engineer I had not contact with the complaints department until I again phoned 10 days later. I have now agreed to continue paying the same price for downloading 9Mb and uploading 0.2Mb although the speeds I was quoted were download 18 -25mb
and uploading 3.2-5.0Mb."
patrick,dumfries,4/9/15,"I initially ordered on 23rd August 2014, received hub on 11th September.Told by email that I'd cancelled my order and needed to return the hub and that I'd placed a new order both on 13th September. Phoned customer services who struggled to understand, possibly due to language barrier, but was told to return the hub and would receive a new one, which was exactly the same as the old one. Next I received an email with a engineer time slot that was blank. Eventually broadband started on 1st october, 2 weeks after agreed start date, causing considerable inconvenience.

While broadband speed is good, the hub needs reset every 1-2 days.

Would not recommend, and will not be continuing contract."
MG,Oxford,4/5/15,"We moved to a new build development in Oxford and had no choice but to go with BT for broadband as Virgin Media did not have permission by the developers to install cable even though there is 100 Mb Vigin media cable upto the entrance of our complex. We struggled for months to just get our phone line and broadband connected by BT. When it was finally connected (only after escalating to their high level complaints team), we immediately had a fault after less than a week. We had a number of short intermittent faults and now we have yet another major fault a month or so later. Their call centres are no help at all and we just get told the fault will be fixed within 48 hours. I was previously with Virgin Media and had a considerably more reliable service with a fault every 5 years or so instead of every month and usually fixed with 5 hours rather than 48..."
Ken,Elland,4/5/15,"Im so unimpressed with BT and beating my head against a wall, I struggle to even go through it all again.

Customer service really is a shambles where you constantly have to re-explain . it always 'my' fault even tho it isnt

Briefly got fiber at 70/20. In january 2015 BT started work replacing my cabinet (which they are still doing in April) when they did this my speed dropped to 35/3. Repeated calls to offshore idiots who as me to check cable. An engineer came out who told me yes I had a fault - went to cabinet to patch me into a different port - called me to say hes leaving it because the cabinet is a mess... BT dont seem to record any information so next person I speak to asks me if I have checked my cables!!!! This went on and on until I said if Im getting slow connection I'll just pay £25 a month instead of £45. I can only do that if I sign a twelve month contract .. OK signed up with SKY (I know sky will use the same line - but I wont be paying for 70M and getting 40). Final joke is they keep contacting me asking why Im leaving. If they had any kind of system they could look at the 8 calls I've made and 20 people I've spoken to to figure that out!!"
Lkatraz,Warwickshire,4/4/15,Avoid !!! Absolutely sick of BT I cannot believe I left Virgin for this biggest mistake I made. Our package is BT infinity 2 and my speed right now is 1.8 !!! Should be up to 76 !!! We have to get an engineer out now £120 !!! Even though we havnt been with them a year and we have complained on many occasions.. Awful service and the call centre is crap they struggle with English. Our contract is up in May and we are not renewing I would advise everyone to steer clear they just want a sale and don't follow up with the promise .
Jerry,Bristol,4/4/15,"I had been a loyal customer for many years and then when things went wrong I had a massive bill and when I complained their belligerent arrogant customer service dept told me that i had miss used their service! (as if anyone would pay a fee to avoid extra charges would then go and mss use the service) So after complaining in writing I wrote and told then that I was going to a reputable communication company and accused BT of obtaining money by deception, which they ignored I have been a happy user with VM and have broadband at 50Mb that is great for my Apple kit so don't even think about going to BT you will regret it."
Mr James,,4/3/15,
Richard,Ulverston,4/2/15,Do not go with BT. Very expensive and appalling customer service and repair engineers do not turn up to fix problems even given the 5 hour long appointment wind (this has happened twice) without even an excuse or apology.
Thomas,Wales,4/1/15,During the 5 years on BT Broadband We have experienced many problems. If you have a fault with your phoneline expect them to take at least a month so send out 3 clueless engineers to run tests and tell you the phoneline is fine until a smart one comes along and fixes it. If your problem is anything other than a phoneline fault then good luck my friend because I've had unstable/unusable internet for the past 4 months with no end in sight. I think they've sent around 10 engineers to our door and they've just told us that is isn't their problem.
Alex Smith,London,3/31/15,"The worst service I have ever had to endure for anything.
Please don't take the risk of using bt as they are truly awful"
Paul,Wakefield,3/31/15,"Dear BT - wake up we are in 2015 and you are supposed to be a communications company
Just had 8 days of no broadband many phone calls and texts between myself and BT and the broadband is back on well done BT however ...........
BT accepted they made a catalogue of errors inculing mis communication between internal departments and me the paying customer , they accepted the fault was at the exchange and should have been identified immediately, they accepted they failed to call me back when they called from india and the call got cut off , they accepted the BT staff (except the engineer that fixed the fault) needed more training and had not done their jobs correctly , they accepted that if they were in my position they would be completely dissatisfied with the service and wait for it ...... In lite of all this i was due some compensation ........ Yes a whole £15 Wow i said lets go and party ! Or i sugested the BT staff came and worked for me for 8 days for £15 and this would enable them to unerstand a customers point of view - SO BT you have a long way to go in customer service and communications dealing with you is like dealing with an automated tarot reading machine yes keep putting the money in and she will keep giving you cards containing lots of false promises ! Well done !"

Joshua Richard Cleaver-Ross,"Blackpool, UK",3/29/15,"READ THIS GUYS!!!

I never write these but I've had enough now! I'm having to do this on my mobile because my internet has crashed again and India (who can't understand me at all or are aware of the details on my account at all) decided that it's the line which was tested on the Thursday by an engineer to be fully functional!

Since I joined BT I've had nothing but problems. Lied to on the phone and once a month I pay for nothing!

I moved into my grandads house after losing my job and having to move back home it took me 4 months to finally give in and think why not I'm still paying for it I might as well get internet installed till the end of the year.

I asked the guy on the phone for BT if my grandad could keep his home number and I have a seperate one for my internet, the landline was provided by talk talk. They said that was fine oh was I mislead!

When the engineer installed the hub he gave me a new number and everything was working fine then I got a call from BT to confirm my number transfer and once again I asked them if my grandad would keep his number they said yes.

Long story short they cancelled my deal with talk talk stole my grandads number and used it for my broadband. So now my grandad has to be calmed down each morning before I go to work because he can't ring my mum to let her know he's ok. The phone line has been cut off by talk talk. He has Alzheimer's for God sake you sick people BT! Just because you can't listen!

4 weeks he hasn't had a landline! Now my internet has stopped working AGAIN!!! I want to take this to court and make them pay for this!

To fix the whole problem they tried to charge me 50 quid!! I'm stuck in limbo now with no internet and no landline thanks to BT's award winning customer service well fuck you BT! All you cause is upset and more money added onto the bill!!! Read this and know I will be taking action legally against you if I can afford it after you ripping me off for over a year!!!"
Jules,Cheshire,3/29/15,"They aggressively up-sold my 76 year old father to fibre when he wanted DSL promising it would be cheaper, proceeded to charge him for services they said they would throw in free, provided him with a broken YouView and all this took a month a month and a half of wrangling with their ""customer services"" and literally two days on the phone so far. Still not sorted. Aggressive, misleading sales-people, entirely broken customer support. Expensive compared to the competition. Much more trouble than they are worth. Avoid at all cost."
Sanctusbrown,Stratford on Avon,3/28/15,"BT, Bt when will you begin to become the leader in communications. I wish I could tell Sid how crap you have become since privatisation. A useless company that does not want customers. I am constantly surprised as to why customers do not move from BT. On a monthly basis complained about Broadband connection. Finally agreed that Router was at fault but wanted me to sign another contract before sending me another router!! Well I am in the process of moving elsewhere!"
Anna,Birmingham,3/28/15,"the worst broadband ever
advisers not trained to help just to hold you on the phone for over an hour to download crappy help tools and your issue is never resolved the way it should be. when my contract is finish i will be looking for another provider.
For your sake never sign a contract with them"
J HOLDEN,WEST BROMWICH,3/27/15,"BT want to get there old Customers back from what I see, but there is no way I would ever recommend using this Company, regarding Customer Services or there Broadband which was a total nightmare trying to understand on numerous occasions by speaking to some Foreign hard to understand English Speaking Broadband Representative that never sorted the continuing wifi lost connection that we eventually sorted by having a trouble free Sky Setup. Ps with BT make shure you always find out who you have spoken to and get it in writing to save you frustrating hours on the phone."
Joanna Hamilton,Aberdeen,3/25/15,I am spending between £60 - £80 per month for a t.v service which we cannot use; broadband that constantly drops and that I can only get in the room of the router; and a phone line. I cannot get out of the contract and would face nearly £400 to cancel early. We tried to do this anyway (thinking it would be cheaper after about 6 months) but backed out within the 14 day period I was given as we could not afford this one off £400. We were still charged £12 as they apparently had a reconnection fee. I am despairing about this situation. I can't afford this and it is just HELL being contracted with this company.

Pete,East midlands,3/24/15,"The speed advertised is never what you get, but you would expect a lot higher than the speed available here. also the BT online speed checker is not very accurate when compared to other unbiased versions."
Rebecca kissask,bromsgrove,3/23/15,"What a shambles, been with bt 3 months of witch 2 months on the phone to them, if I do another reset I will break down, on my second remote as they thought that will keep me quiet, noooo!! They have no clue, they wanted me to have a cable running down the stairs to feed my computer upstairs, how dangerous..
They haven't a clue and can't wait to get back to sky !"
Nyah,Islington,3/23/15,The only thing more appalling then this ridiculously slow and unreliable broadband is lack of service. I have had this for one month and it hasn't worked properly. Each time I call I get old something completely different. This is no better than a scam.
Sue,Dronfield,3/22/15,"Seems like a good package on the face of it and yes I knew it was going to be slightly cheaper for the first six months. However, I didn't expect that my bill,would go up from £20 to £40'within a year and all that time I haven't been able to watch full programmes on many TV channels as my TV has pixelated since going with BT. Never had that problem before. Real shame because I really like the TV package but it would be as cheap to go with Sky or Virgin. Going to change asap. Wish I had never bothered with what I thought was a good and reliable company. How wrong I was!"
Shellard,Bristol,3/19/15,"For over a week now we have had the wifi dropping out every 30 seconds. I have been on the phone to an Indian call centre for over 6 hrs in total. I have done all the diagnostics they have asked me to, some more than once. I have spoken to managers who have not been helpful, i have been cut off twice and promised call backs which I have not recieved. I have had to unscrew boxes on the wall and expose wires! I am still without wifi after all this and no sign of an engineer.I have been asked to buy new equipment and renew my contract before they will help me, even though my contract has another 9 months to run. I warn anyone thinking of taking an account with BT NOT TO!!! they have no concept of customer service and I am at my wits end. I think i will cancel my direct debit and let them take me to court!"
Alex,Plympton,3/18/15,"I was stuck with BT for over a year due to my location and am now switching to Virgin. Imagine my eye popping rage when I saw that virgin offered over 3x the speed of BT for the same price!!! I picked up the phone and did battle with some fairly depressed sounding BT customer service drones. They fed me plenty of contradictory information and sales-lies before they finally granted me exit from their overpriced laim-speeds. Farwell BT, you are an outdated face on the head of my time."
Andy,Norfolk,3/17/15,"Contacted customer service what a shambles. Ran tests blamed our equipment, supplied by bt as part of the package. When they get stressed they blame Internet connections in your area. Funny when you ask what area are having issues they say areas hundreds of miles away. Perhaps they should teach a little geography to the Indian call centres.
Having said that still no broardband stability as it keeps dropping out an bt still blame our end.
The worst bit is they do not know what the issue is and cannot be truthful about anything"
dvd,United Kingdom,3/16/15,Just moved from BT to Sky .. as my broadband kept dropping every couple of minutes had reported this issue many times but never got it sorted plus i got the same deal with Sky for half the price .. Been with BT many years so much for loyalty.
Peter Evans,Pembrokeshire,3/15/15,"Having recently declined an offer to upgrade, Lo and behold my bt internet connection has become extremely slow. Ha any reason bt?

An honest answer would be appreciated."
Blanche,Bath,3/14/15,"DON'T GO WITH BT - THERE ARE MANY CHEAPER OPTIONs. THEY ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND THE MOST ANNOYING PROVIDER.
I've just been stitched up by BT. I moved house and stupidly, to keep life simple decided to move with them. This meant that I had to change my account, as I was persuaded as it'd be cheaper.

Now here in lies a snag. You only get 14days from the request to get a BT account, even though you may have been an existing customer, to ditch it. Not 14 days from when the account commences or the standard 28days you get from the majority of services/products you purchase.

BT said I would have service on the 2nd, then the 4th, then 6th, then 9th. This meant a full 7days without BB, with the phone link kicking in on the evening of the 6th. The phone line was noisy for 5days. Every time I received or made a call the BB cut out. It did restart but was frustrating. So I need an engineer. To add insult to injury, I get read out a standard if your equipment is at fault you will be fined £120!!

When I complained and requested compensation, well guess what folks, they will only offer compensation after the fault has been fixed. Dire customers service - and I mean the UK call centres. Awful.

As soon as I'm can afford to I will be ditching BT."
g s,Rotherham,3/13/15,
Marcus T,"Didcot, Oxfordshire",3/9/15,"Worst experience I've ever had with broadband (and I've used many other ISPs).

BT are perhaps the most incompetent company that I've *ever* come in contact with, and I would not wish being exposed to their services upon my worst enemies.

Main points from our experience:
- After being given an 'activation date' that was pushed back twice, it was then pushed back another three times (each time adding an extra week). After 5 weeks we still had no service and tried to cancel it completely.

- A BT engineer turned up at our property completely uninvited AFTER we had cancelled the account. I let him in anyway to see what he thought - he confirmed that everything we'd been told on the phone from the faults team was completely false (they told us it was an exchange problem - which he said if true would mean the whole village would be without broadband, which wasn't the case).

- After 5 weeks of no internet or any service I tried to cancel the account and BT tried to impose a £270 cessation charge - despite themselves breaking the contract by not providing any service.

- When I tried to cancel the account, instead of actually cancelling it, they just raised a complaint, gave me an incorrect reference number (meaning I had to go through the whole process again), which delayed the whole process of cancelling the account.

Generally, it seems that no one on the end of a BT phone number has much authority to do anything - nor the ability to accurately diagnose or solve likely problems.

By contrast, after cancelling BT we went for EE - who had us up and running straight away with no hassle. What's amusing is that they obviously use BT engineers and the BT lines for their service... which shows just how incompetent and useless ordering through BT is.

Having spoken to several other BT customers, it doesn't seem like our issue was isolated. Our neighbours use BT Infinity and they said they're just waiting for their contract to expire as the service is awful.

If you were considering using BT infinity, I'd strongly recommend going elsewhere - even if it means paying more, it'll save you from hours of phone calls with useless BT staff and spending weeks trying to configure a service that will probably never end up working."
Upset,HP6 5RT,3/8/15,"BT Infinity - As I write this I'm getting ping response times in the many thousands of ms from google.com and download speed of less than 1 mb, I believe I'm paying for 36 mb ish"
Mike Atkins,Kent,3/8/15,"This has to be the worst broadband I have ever had. I operate on a Mac based systems and have never had a problem with my broadband. I travel and lot and I have always been able to get a connection. However, ""up-grad"" to infinity and I have had nothing but problems. The system simply will not allow my mac laptops (yes plural - there are three in the house) - to hook up to the internet. I have complained to BT three times and they access the system remotely but deny there is an issue.

Sometimes I can get access to the WWW but this is quite rare. I spoke with BT today and they insisted it was a problem with my Mac systems and not their equipment. I asked them to prove this was the case and they were unable to - instead insisting that their equipment was 100 secure and working. I'm left with no option other than to sue to breach of contract. DO NOT UP GRADE TO INFINITY AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM BT IS SHOCKING."
Jim K,Yorkshire,3/6/15,"I was having troulble connecting to the Internet, and my computer showed me a Phone number to contact. This was a recorded message that told me there were no issues in my area so i should log on to an e-mail address!! Then it hung up with me not being able to log on as i had no internet. I eventually contacted BT after a week, and was told there was a computer glitch and my order had been overlooked. I was promised on a number of occassions that i would be contacted (none of which happened), so i had to keep ringing back to be told i would have to wait yet another week for my activation date! As i write this i am stillwaiting to be connected, so i hope when this happens it is a good service..."
web j,hampshire,3/4/15,bt ask us to change to infinity we agreed had always had evening and weekend calls for years and asked for it with the new package. we were sold the new package with just weekend calls and all our evening calls for 18 months were being charged because we are elderly and bt take the money from our bank we didn't notice for all that time we were overcharged by £300 over an 18 month period and bt are not interested in there mistake just waiting till may when I can end my contract after many years with bt avoid this company
Alex,London,3/4/15,"The security is useless. If all passwords including the online login are reset by the reset button then all parent controls are useless!

The customer service is awful. I ahve called about the security issue. I was first told repeatedly that my account was not with BT and that I was wrong. I provided all my details, eventually they found my account from all the CORRECT information I had provided, no appology was given. The opperator was short and rude.

To resolve the security issuee I was told to put the router in a wooden box.

You can buy routers that do not have this issue.

Overall the service with BT is awful. I have had problems in the past and avoided BT for this reason. I had heard they were better... they are not."
Brian J,Anglesey,3/4/15,Extremely disappointed in the service provided by BT. The new e-mail system is a bit of a joke. I feel that the customer service that is provided is just there to frustrate you and make you give up on the enquiry/complaint.

Bob Lemon,"Brentor, Devon",3/1/15,"WiFi on Home Hub 3 stopped working and advice from Customer Services was to buy a new hub from another manufacturer since BT do not support WiFi and will not replace defective hub. Netgear Hub works perfectly, but after about a week speed dropped from 3MB to 2MB so suspect BT have reduced since I am no longer able to support FON users.
Dreadful customer support and will probably change in Jan 16 when contract expires."

Iain m,30 miles from central london,2/28/15,We live only 30 miles south of central London and we get only 1Mbps and we are unlikely to ever see high speed broadband. So much for the government's commitment to even nearby rural areas. Utter hogwash! We miss out on all decent deals for Internet and subsequent access. Disgusted of Sussex!
Iain Fergusson,Lockerbie,2/28/15,"Terrible! thats all I can say. They have a fibre activated exchange some 0.2 miles from my property (and many other sin centre of town including many many buisnesses) and the NEW green fibre boxes evn closer (in all within 0.5miles ten boxes (i have counted them BT! and yet it is only a elite few in Lockerbie who can recieve infinity. My contract was taken on the assurity that infinity would be available at the start of this year (albeit a verbal promise, In scotland Verbal is as good as written) however it has failed yet again to supply any dates, information or truth. I for one have told them they have until May when my contract runs out and then they can collect their hub, phone and line from my car park where it will be after being ripped out! RUBBISH BT absolute RUBBISH"
Rex Symons,"North Nibley, Gloucestershire",2/27/15,"Broadband in our Village is dreadful. We are not far from Cities of Bristol & Gloucester, yet there are times when broadband fails. Speed at very best can be 1 mb, but much more likel;y to be a lot less. On occassions when I have tried to test the speed, it has been so slow it won't even drive the speed tester.
We had hoped that fibre broadband would be coming to the village when BT brought it to our local exchange. But 2 years on we are told they aren't. This is unacceptable in 21st Century in England. Time BT monopoly was stopped. We pay a lot for a poor service. Worst of all is that letters to BT never get answers and one can never identify who makes the decisions.

Do something about it!!!"
ChovenSen,Frimley,2/25/15,"Be advised. Don't go with BT. They are dearer despite a poor service. Be warned there is a £30.00 Cancellation charge, if you ever leave BT broadband, not to mention the arrogant customer service agents.

Adrian,South Devon,2/24/15,"Unimpressed and angry with BT
Upgraded to Infinity 1 unlimited after our normal BT Broadband was getting worse, ie frequent times when no internet available .suspected they were doing it on purpose to nudge you into fibre super fast broadband.
My New hub5 arrived on schedule and for a few days my speed was almost the 37 meg as advertised.

Then tried to watch Eurosport Player bloody hopeless. Stops after a every couple of minutes,useless trying to watch live sport.
Started getting emails from Libby in customer services asking for their Youview box to be returned. We had BT TV for over 12 months and paid £50 to BT for the Youview box and was told at the time that after 12 months we can keep the box,.
I declined their reduced price offer of £2 per month when I upgraded to Infinity 1 . They have a nerve to keep asking by text messages as well as email for the box back.
To add insult to injury they have just charged me £5.60 for exceeding my monthly allowance of 40gig.
Don't these stupid people know that I have unlimited broadband use with Infinity 1.after being persuaded by them to upgrade.
Oh and checked my speed today 5 meg this morning and 10 meg this evening.
I have threatened to report them to trading standards/offcom
If they don't refund my £5.60 immediately. Don't hold your breath.Bt need exposing on watchdog or you and yours.!!!"
Wendy,Chester,2/24/15,
Cory,Plymouth,2/23/15,"Pay for a 75Mb connection, usually receive in the region of 35Mb. The customer service is shockingly awful, they don't care in the slightest so don't expect them to help you. We were stunted with an engineer bill of £130 as well, for an issue that even the engineer told us was BT's fault and not our own, an oversight by the original engineer in the set up cost us in the long term.

On top of this issues like losing Broadband service for a week at a time (with no apparent fault on their end), and over a month waiting time to get set up initially make this all in all a great practice in wasting money and time."
Andrew J,"Chorley, Lancashire",2/23/15,"Overall for several months I have found the BT broadband and TV service to be very poor the customer service to be polite has been an absolute shambles.
For over three months we have had erratic broadband service with frequent outages; the BT Vision has not worked at all for weeks. I have Open Reach technicians send hours here, the last one diagnosed a fault underground in December but as at the 22nd February it is still not resolved. The good news is that we have a new cable on our property connection the distribution box under the footpath outside my house which comes on to my property via a new trench dug through my garden and drive but the bad news is that it ends in 3 Metres of loose unconnected cable lying on my drive - a chocolate teapot at least have some use since we could eat it...
The worst part of BT's (total lack of customer service) is having to deal with the BT call centres which seem to be in India. The people there are doing there best to provide service but the whole BT customer service system when there is an ongoing fault is in a state of absolute shambles. I have had dozens of discussions with the call centres, most of which result in total frustration on my part since the call centre folks are only given part of story by BT Open Reach folks which has resulted in hours of wasted time on calls and call backs.
My requests to speak to someone in the UK who is dealing directly with resolving our Broadband/TV service meet with a complete blank refusal. I ask to escalate my but all I get is someone else repeating the same half true stories and then being met with continued unfulfilled promises as to when my service problems will be resolved."
Georgina,Aylesbury,2/23/15,"My experience with BT has got to be the worst experience I have ever, ever had as a consumer and I strongly recommend others steer well clear. 6 weeks, over 30 phone calls to BT, several hours on hold, 40 occasions of being misadvised, stood up by 3 x engineers, £121 and still no broadband."

I have been a bt customer for 5 weeks and have nevrr had so much stress over getting Internet"
JCDCLA,"Corby, Northamptonshire",2/21/15,"Firstly disappointed to find out that because we have moved into a new build estate that BT are our only option so we compared prices and the unlimited Infinity 1 package seemed like a pretty good deal. We signed up but there was a problem.

First issue was that Openreach had to go out and install the line and BT would call back with and update 3 days later. They did call back but the voicemail was that another update would be forthcoming in 3 days time. So I waited and 3 days later another update was due 3 days later. Another three days and the voicemail said that the explanation would be provided in another five days time.

Now so far I've not been too upset as BT had kept to their estimated callbacks and as it's a newbuild I had to expect some hiccoughs.

The update call with the 'reason' I got was that openreach are unable to provide the service as there is no phoneline! I knew this because I am asking them to install the flamin' line! 'We are sorry Sir but we have cancelled your order'.

At this point knowing BT are my only option and they cannot provide the service at all with no explanation is ridiculous! I have asked for the matter to be escalated but I doubt this will make any difference.

So we are now faced with moving into a nice new house today that won't have a phone line or broadband indefinitely. No I would not recommend them but when they control the monopoly of lines I wish there was at least another ISP to try! But there isn't."

2) the engineer went to our old address where we haven't lived for 7yr
3) billed us for a youview box that was with the engineer who went to our old address
4) after dealing with their Bangalore call centre and being promised a call back twice funny never happened

M. Emiliou,Sutton Coldfield,2/19/15,"Had BT Infinity for 2 years and the speed has been well below normal broadband speed. After numerous hours calling there useless customers service and technical support,they failed to resolve the problem but still charged the higher price for this so called ""superfast' Infinity.

This was promised and they agreed the sale. The day came, no engineer turned up and after US calling BT, we were told the port had been closed and capacity sold to someone else!!! Leaving us without Broadband infinity until 18th March. With no apology or admittance of fault. Then having to spend a total amount of 5 hours to get dialup set up for next week.
Which is pointless for work. Absolutely the worst service I have EVER had from a company."

steve s,suffolk,2/16/15,"will never use bt again. signed up for bt infinity a few years ago via fibre optic and all was well, then soon after the 2 year contract ran out the broad band speed got slower and slower made numerous calls to the technical department and both I and they had problems understanding each other due to the language difficulties they always carry out the same tests that take 10 to 15 minutes a time and always say that their systems show that we are getting 70mb down load speed, try to explain to them that we are often getting less than 1mb and they just put up defensive walls and refuse to listen they also seemed surprised that i refused to go out and but a lead to connect my computor to the hub so that they could test this, tried to explain that it was their hub and i wanted an engineer to come out and test it and they refused. spoke with one young lady who to be fair was very helpful and she got us to press the reset button on the rear of the hub that sorted the problem in the short term but we are having to press the reset button 2 or 3 times a day to get a decent down load speed. finally to day asked to speak with customer services uk to speak about cancelling my contract with them as they seemed incapable of resolving the problem and the young lad agreed that it sounded like and old hub that wasn't up to the job and that i needed an upgrade and then wanted to charge me for a replacement hub tried to explain that i pay them for a service which they are not providing and that the hub is theirs and not mine and that maybe they would like to replace the hub as part of the service that i pay for and he said that he would speak with his manager and call me back, i have heard nothing from them since and so have spent the rest of the afternoon speaking to other suppliers and will dropping bt as soon a possible"
Vijay,Cambridge,2/16/15,"Firstly, service, in one word, is PATHETIC. BT took a sweet 20 days to put up the line. And the line did not work! They took another 7 days to fix the problem.

The speed was excellent. It worked without problems for exactly 2 weeks. After that, the disruptions began. The modem would stop working every 15 minutes to two hours, for 15 seconds to 3 minutes, at random. This basically means that you cannot stream movies without having interruptions at random. You cannot VPN into office without having to go through the trouble of reconnecting at random intervals.

Then comes customer support. Support folks are mostly a friendly lot with intentions to help. Though the intentions rarely translates to actual proper, satisfying resolutions.

I took the connection because of the speed and unlimited service, but little did I know that the advertisement not mentioning an uninterrupted service meant that the service would be as pathetic as it is!

I would rather go for lesser speed with download limits than continue with such a horrible service, but unfortunately, they want me to pay a discontinuation fee of some sort. I think I might take this to court since there are many ongoing, registered complaints regarding this.

The saddest part is that this is my first experience in the UK, and I am thoroughly disappointed because the so-called ""Third world nation"" that I come from, offers much better service, reliability, customer service! So much for the British experience..

PS: No nationality based offense meant. But the BT service so far, is what it is."
Bridget,Canterbury,2/16/15,"Don't use BT! Their custom service is appauling. Incompetant, rude and seriously unhelpful. They are vastly over priced and everything is added on as extras meaning you end up paying even more than you thought to get the same service as elsewhere. Their fibre optic broadband is only fine if you are plugged in, the wireless drops out constantly and the router has to restart all the time causing no end of trouble. Would leave now if I wasn't tied into a contract. Never using BT again!"
Dan,Barrow,2/15/15,"Signed up to a phone, broadband,tv & sport pack. Less than £30 a month. Equipment delivery and engineer were both early. BT Wifi & BT Sport apps are great extras. I had a fault which was fixed within a week including engineer visit at no charge. Even the infamous BT Indian call centre called as promised. Would recommend to anyone"
Gadd,Leeds,2/13/15,"Sad to say BT are very poor. I eventually changed to sky.

I had broadband and phone with BT @ £43.00 a month. Speeds were 0.8 download and 0.2 upload but at weekends we often got zero. I concur with other posters that customer service was useless and even total lies. I threatened to take them to court through breach of terms and conditions and left BT on that basis.

Now on Sky broadband on exact same copper wire and get 3.8 download and 0.8 upload. Broadband is quite stable also.

The problem lies with BT."
James,oxfordshire,2/13/15,"Poor broadband speed, terrible customer service which is in part due to typical 'large company' internal processes. No ownership of problems or complaints, complaints not registered and have to push to resolve."
Bob,Uxbridge,2/12/15,"I am ex BT. When India starting controlling our install & mtce work it all went downhill overnight. When we had Ifinity2 upgrade an ex Railway guy who had worked for BT for 6 weeks did install...did not understand how to reconnect extension wiring to new master linejack..ha ha ha..

Feel really sorry for all BT customers. Service now is terrible.
A few managers I had were diamonds,
the rest completely useless."
cabbage,Aberdeenshire,2/12/15,"I've been a longstanding BT customer using both phone and broadband, had issues with an old router resolved (router started making weird noises but still worked, called BT and they sent out a new one sharpish). Had various packages and upgrades over the years, though it is very difficult to get a cheaper package, I have to ""leave"" BT and then sign up again which is annoying. Use broadband for streaming TV, regular surfing, speeds are good except streaming at peak times is not possible. Also use the openzone Wifi when out and about which is very handy. As long as I can get a good deal I will keep using them."
Mrs Tweedy,Ayrshire,2/12/15,"Just moved from BT to SKY due to the following;

1. Horrendous performance including multiple drop - outs, slowwwwww speeds, weird loss of Internet during heavy rain (BT accused me of imagining this), and did I mention the (many,many,many) drop - outs?

2. Customer 'service' is a joke. Call centres in India where the poor souls are clearly reading from a script and have zero ability to actually listen to what you're saying far less actually offer a helpful solution. And they never, ever, EVER ring you back after they tell you they will. Ever.

3. Faulty hub. And again. And again. And again.

4. I think BT are bloated, arrogant and complacent and they don't deserve my hard earned cash.

Sky on the other hand have been wonderful and THEIR Indian call centre has staff who actually are allowed to think for themselves. Also they make you feel like they appreciate that you've chosen them and want to make you happy. Hooray!"
Eddie,Chipping Campden,2/11/15,"I live in the country, so my internet will always be slow. But my exsperence with Bt has been awful. Lost my phone line for just under a month. It made my internet even worse. After they fixed it I had charges I never made. Dealing with customer service was the worse part of it all. No one speaks English good and it's very difficult when you have a problem and they will not say sorry for the bad service. I had to fight for any compensation and its was almost not worth the effort. Can wait for my contact to finish. Think I might just leave early."
Andy Littlewood,Rochdale,2/11/15,"Our community group as been with BT for 5 years now, and have recently just upgraded to 38Mb fibre.

On the old ADSL, we had a wireless speed of 18Mb and now have a wireless speed of 36Mb on fibre.

The only contact I have had with them, was when we phoned to upgrade. Dealt with sincere courtesy and everything which was promised was promised. The engineer turned up this week between the promised times and within 30 minutes we were upgraded.

I do not know what they are like when you have problems, as we have not (touch wood) had any with them.

Over our 5 years experience, I can recommend."
Colin,Essex,2/11/15,"My Daughter ordered this system on line, having been lured by the provision of the free BT sports on TV. Other than that she had been happy with her previous ISP. Talk Talk.
I too ordered the same system a day or so apart. (I live a 3 minute walk away)
To cut a very long story short: upon connection it soon become apparent that my daughter could not get BT sport on TV. Over the next 7/10 days we spoke to BT customer service (An appalling service) about this problem. Here is a rough log of calls.

1. Order management office Cardiff (some of the information I was given here was either totally incorrect or misleading, but there was no apology nor solution provided.
2. An advisor in Belfast (Ditto above)
3. An English speaking lady Melanie in the UK
4. Shefali India (promised to call back the next day) and of course that didn't happen even though I gave her my mobile number and it was connected with 5 bars all day
5. Yokes India. This gentlemen was down right rude. So I asked to speak to his Manager ..?
6. Chanda India ( The manager) I may as well have been talking to myself) totally inept
7. Erin (UK) I suspect Liverpool area. At last a young lady who recognised that she was talking to a Customer. ""I really do care about my customers"" she bravely and genuinely stated. I pointed out respectfully that if she did it would be better to leave BT and find an organisation that would compliment her natural talents and beliefs.

My simple request was this: wether BT sport on TV is free or not. My daughter ordered the system BECAUSE that was the main lure. It hasn't been supplied and no date for when it could be was given. On that basis it is only fair for her to be able to cancel the service and receive a full refund without charges. BT say that because their confusing online order system caught her out, tough luck. If she cancels now not only will there be no refund, on the contrary she will have to pay a cancellation charge.

Only a monstrous, outsized, disorganised poorly resourced Dinosaur like BT could treat their Customers like this and get away with it because they simply DON'T care.

I will never, ever.....use this despicable organisation again for a packaged internet TV or phone provision, even though I have recently ordered the same at the same system. I will have to suffer their disgustingly poor customers care for 12 months as will my daughter (even though she has not received what she sincerely believed she'd ordered)
Then it's Goodbye, Alvida and good riddance .

If you want a good standard of customer care avoid BT or use them at you Peril. They as far away from British as the planet Pluto!!!"
IhateBT,england,2/9/15,"If there was a choice to put NO stars I would. What a rip-off of a company! They have a reputable name so you expect a lot from them but the customer service IS USELESS and in INDIA. The customer services team seem to struggle at times to understand and process English. Thankfully I left them last year and cleared up everything, however I considered continuing my contract with then when I moved so gave them my forwarding address etc. Today nearly 6 months later I receive an email from a debt collection agency saying I owe them £35!!! I ring them up only to be told I did not give them my forwarding address so obviously they used this agency to trace me and now I have to pay them 25% fee on top of what they say I owe them!! I am LIVID. I absolutely abhor this company!!"
Adam,Bournemouth,2/9/15,"Avoid at all costs.

Connection is poor and live in an area surround by fibre optic yet our house plus 6 others seem to have been missed out even though you can't get much closer to the main hub yet BT won't connect us otherwise i'd be with Virgin.

Got sent a non functioning hub and after spending a week phoning India repeating and jumping through hoops to get this sorted the only offer given to me was to send an engineer and be charged £129.99 because they sent equipment that didn't work. Then the engineer didn't turn up and had to book more time off work for another to be sent.

They will scam you unless you go for there infinity if they feel like connecting your area up that is, Avoid, Avoid and Avoid.

Also Ombudsman doesn't care because they were paid off with buying up all the contracts. Monopoly wins and average consumer gets ripped off.

Parents use sky and they are 10 times better, think anyone else is better and until people stop using BT and the government sell the contracts out fairly this won't change."
Miss Carpenter,Horsham,2/9/15,"Overpriced service, which whilst it has been reliable in the main, since organising a switch over to another provider has become un-usable, dropping constantly, very low ping times. Biggest gripe with BT is the cost, hugely expensive service, with no offers to keep pace and be competitive if you are already a user. Thus almost forcing you to move providers, stupid business strategy, now moving for a like for like deal that is a quarter of the cost! Line dropping is a big feature and always has been, annoying when watching BBC iPlayer or doing streaming....."
alison jenkins,sittingbourne,2/8/15,"Poor service yet again from BT. I wonder whether any of their departments communicate.. I have TV broadband and phone with BT... I recently became eligible for Netflix free as part of my package.. Signed up for it... I enquired as to me having Netflix in the past and cancelling my subscription would be a problem as its the same email address I use now... I was told no problem... And yet on setting up my new box which took 25 minutes , only to discover Netflix not working... I then phoned BT only to spend a further forty minutes of my time talking to asia, only to then be told oh the department we need is closed ... I will have to call you tomorrow... Apparently I should of received an email from another department... Of course, standard with BT... Said email has not been sent... Every time I use BT for any sort of upgrade it is never straightforward or simple.. And always involves being pushed from pillar to post and taken forever to be resolved....I have come to accept that this poor service is just the norm from BT... And that yes of course most definitely means no not possible...i am infuriated by their incapapabilities"
jack park,harlow,2/5/15,always breaking up - longwinded access - call centre a bad joke- crap basically
Richard,Doncaster,2/5/15,"5 weeks and still waiting for the smooth migration from aol over to bt... worsed mistake ever!!!!
Left with no internet what so ever not even old trusty aol..
Placed order over five weeks ago only to find out my order had failed not once, not twice, but three times for what ever reason, they gave me so many complicated reasons as to why an order can fai...(failed because sombody didn't click the mouse properly).. I was promised a smooth migration as they put it with no loss of Internet connection it would just switch over at midnight...
The change over day has arrived and I guess I am paying from today's date but I have no router no TV set top box or anything els for that matter... I even recived a tx message saying my router would be with me yesterday... Still nothing worsed company ever... Don't bother with bt the lame excuses have been almost entertaining.. If I didn't have things to be getting with online like emails ect I would find this big joke hilarious..."
BTareUSELESS,Somerset,2/4/15,"have tried for over a month to move from Sky broadband to BT infinity 2 (due to their monopoly with fibre) and it has been a nightmare! first my address couldn't be found on their database, appointment booked only for engineer visit to be canceled 2 days before, tried calling to fix this and passed around the globe from one call centre to another with no one having a clue what the problem is. have spent well over 5 hours on the phone trying to resolve this but with no luck. The managing director of sales (libby Barr) should be sacked"
Stephen,St. Ives,2/3/15,BT package is Infinity 2 Unlimited and (calls £7.50 a month) Since starting this package on 8th January broadband has been around 12 times today 3rd Feb. The broad when working is down to a download speed of 0.03 Mb/s which is worse than the old dial up and you can't use it. Avoid BT like the plague.
Si,United Kingdom,2/3/15,"I am trying to watch the FA cup reply Manchester United V Cambridge online, which would have been the pinnacle of my day and would have been a source of entertainment. But to my disappointment and annoyance the website remains half an hour after trying to login, at the login page. I had to receive the score through my friend, who is also irritated, frustrated and pissed off. I think it would be fair of you for the loss of my time and causing me emotion distress, to recover the costs of my displeasure with a Ferrari, preferable a red one. I hope you will sort this out and have back-up measures in places, to avoid this recondite in the future and a Ferrari would not have been given to me. Yours Faithfully, angry, deprived football fan."
Jack,Leeds,1/31/15,"Beware - quoted a package for 12 months but when confirmation came through the price was only discounted for 6 months, make sure you read the small print"
Mr.T.Evans,North Yorkshire,1/30/15,"Moved address in mid January 2015, placed an order for phone, broadband and TV on 8/12/14, plenty of time I thought and could even keep my own number!! Well here I am as February starts tomorrow, phones working, though no answer phone or caller ID, televisions just connected today but no BT sport!!, internets ok, but half of the speed quoted!! And still I wait for my old number to return,, then and then only will BT even consider the days taken off with no engineer, still not sorted out in 2 months and bills that don't tally to what I've had??!!, and I know it's a free phone number, but they're getting paid to speak to me, who's going to reimburse me with the 12 hours (so far) I've spent on the phone because they can't sort a straight forward order out."
Ward,Wellingborough,1/29/15,"Decided to join BT Infinity in May 2014 as it apparently was the best, fastest broadband on the market.
Since May, we've probably made over 20 calls a MONTH to complain about our terrible service. Calls will usually last around 1hr - 3hrs, this is fine if you don't have dinner to cook, places to be and lives to live but sadly, we do. The customer service over the phone is patronizing and usually rude, we get ran through the same things about connecting wires etc, but its no help. They say they note calls but when you call back they tell you you've never called them, even though you spend hours on the phone with them a few weeks prior. We have opened up so many cases now we can't even keep track, none of the cases have been solved. The internet will drop out randomly, sometimes it will talk over 2 hours to turn back on. When the internet goes out, you get steps to follow in your browser, after about 6 times its mind numbingly annoying to go through the process of checking wires, pressing the refresh button and unplugging and plugging things back in even though my router is never touched, only ever cleaned around. On top of that, if you accidently knock over the router - or even just nudge it gently - sometimes it will totally freak out and refuse to connect to the internet.
Recently, the internet drops every hour or so then connects again which is incredibly annoying. We have had a new router sent out and it made no difference.

We called them today and they did some 'tests' on our landline and wireless, apparently their maybe a fault in OUR wires, they are charging and WHOPPING £129.99 to check these wires in our homes, which we are 100% sure they're is nothing wrong with them.

We were previously with TalkTalk, we hope to go back to them but sadly we have to wait for our contract to end before we can do so as they said they would charge a large fee to get out of the contract and we certainly don't want to give them any more money. Avoid BT Internet at all costs."
wilf,cheshire,1/26/15,
Angelica,Leytonstone,1/26/15,"Welcome to the JOKE LAND of BT Business Total Broadband. So here and there you get some issues, sometimes for couple days, sometimes for weeks. Does anybody cares that you running your business online?Nope BT don't give a slip. Do you get compensation or something if you internet isn't properly working for two weeks? NOPE. Does anybody call to see if it's working now, after all you paying for the service? NOPE...So time passes and I receive phone call for renewal, they offering £2 discount and the bill would be £44.00 a month. Really? I been customer for more than 5 Years and I get £2?lol OKEY..I say I will shop around and ask if they could call me tomorrow, they don't sound too happy, plus now they tell me that I should call them back. Really is that how you treat your customers? So I found deal with Talk Talk who offers me same deal for £25.00. So today I get letter from BT saying I will need to pay £53.61 for stopping contract early. HOLD ON..it was just last week I spoke with them regarding renewal. So I call them..Now they telling me I have two different contracts, one for broadband and one for phone line..???but I never asked for two contracts. Yes but for broadband to work you need phone line. So how come they on two different contracts?Cos they two different services...Am confused. So broadband can't work without phone line but they on two different contracts even that broadband can't work without phone line. So wouldn't it be a common sense to put what is needed for broadband to work on one contract?ITS LIKE YOU SELLING A PERFECTLY RUNNING HORSE BUT WITHOUT LEGS which you need to buy separately. Plus because I didn't know that phone line was renewed somehow till October 2015 now I need to pay £53.61. My opinion is: BT DONT CARE about you or your business all BT WANTS is you MONEY."
Tony,natalie cartmer,1/23/15,
Tara watson,,1/22/15,Awful dreadful service. Never again. I've wasted a whole day waiting for a box that they decided to cancel. Not only that but I spent 53 minutes trying to ask what happened and I was out through to four different people all as clueless as the rest
Alice,Derbyshire,1/20/15,"I ordered infinity after a call from bt trying to get me to commit to a new contract. The installation immediately caused problems as they removed an extension from my hallway which was no longer suitable. I accepted this as I was expecting super fast infinity broadband. This hasn't happened!! We are constantly dropping out, speeds are not brilliant. I can't download films from Sky anymore as they removed the extension I was able to use. I cannot speak to anyone but an Indian call centre and they use the scripts and are unable to deviate. On contract until Feb 2016 (6 months in on an 18m). I wish I could get out of it, horrendous service, no customer service.

Karen,Rotherham,1/18/15,
Oziwalkabout,Newdigate,1/18/15,"ZERO STARS: Why would anyone consider joining or transferring to this totally incompetent lot? If you're thinking of either don't waste your time or sanity unless you're a complete masochist!
I placed an order 33 days ago, paid line rental in advance, had a commitment an engineer would be installing the equipment and have had the run around between their 'back office teams' trying to tell me they are unable to 'find' my line. All this despite the fact I've told them over the phone repeatedly the 2 numbers previously used. They cancelled my first order without even telling me, promised me calls to be returned within 48 hours and at no stage did they ever return the calls forcing me to pay over £20 in paid calls for being penalised by their totally unprofessional and inept call centre staff. I demanded escalations and got flogged off between various back office staff who struggled with some of the basics of English let alone who knew the procedure to deal with situations like mine. 33 days later I'm now left with having to resubmit a new order and wait in line. Totally pathetic! Unfortunately there are no other providers in this remote area otherwise I'd have given up ages ago. Do yourself a favour - avoid like the plague! Mr Patterson you have a very serious problem and need to listen to your consumers. My complaint is being forwarded to the top level and I personally hold you responsible."
Jess,Herefordshire,1/18/15,"Would avoid in the future just for the sake of their customer service. After nearly a month of problems, and two weeks without any service, we're finally up and running with no problems (fingers crossed). Their customer service is despicable, I think I spoke to upwards of 50 people before getting our issues resolved (we moved back home and brought our service with us, they cut the old service at the house off before telling us it would be a month before the new one would be live!).

If you have no problems then I'm sure BT are fine, the broadband is good (although sometimes a little patchy when a lot of people are using it) and the phone line is fine.

I would avoid at all costs just because of their customer service though, the most appalling company to have to deal with."
Sanni,London,1/17/15,Do not choose bt the packages are expensive compared to other phone and broadband providers.The Internet broadband was at okay speed at first and then in a couple months became slow.Just remember any call out for faults they charge.

Relentless password resets, shocking Indian Call Centre. MOSTLY LOUSY AFTER SALES SERVICE

Lisa Glassock,Shenfield Essex,1/13/15,"Useless - I think I have spent over day on the phone transferring between departments to get my blasted broadband to work. Every call has lasted about 3 hours and all asking the same questions again and again. My broadband works sporadically and is soooooo slow. BT engineers don't turn up for appointments after you've taken the day off work. If you can get someone else, try them unluckily for me I'm contracted until the summer which I will spend in Costa using their Wi Fi as mine is beyond useless."
John Smith,Norfolk,1/13/15,"BT has been nothing but trouble from Christmas time this year. While everything had been running fine for about a year, we developed an unknown fault and our speed disappeared. Calling residential customer services is like entering into a Monty Python sketch. I have been told incorrect information, reassured excessively that they would fix all my problems and my problems would never come back, begged by them to accept their help when I complained that they were not resolving my problem (this was very unusual), and told I have no problems and everything was ok. They rang me back at inappropriate times (close to midnight walking everyone up), told me they found a technical fault, and when I asked them to explain this, they said it was a technical fault, and when I further asked them to explain it, they said they could, but it was technical. While I am not trying to return a dead parrot, and instead, just have my broadband repaired, I have gone around and around and around and around in circles, and my broadband is still rubbish. They are fine when things are working, mainly because you do not have to interact with customer services. Once things go wrong, they go from bad to worse very quickly."
Geraldine,Finchley,1/13/15,
Julie Stewart,Essex,1/12/15,All of the reviews strike a chord with our experience of BT. It is like being in a parallel universe where all normal rules of customer service go out of the window. You wonder at times if you are going mad. Another 18 months to go !
Melissa,East Sussex,1/12/15,"BT have been absolutely disgusting and disgraceful during my 18 month contract with them. The internet was much slower than promised, the monthly fee for a new customer set very low but after one month I was paying almost double the figure I had agreed. When finding out the contract was 18 months even though I agreed to 12 - I was met with a rude responses from their customer services team stating I would have to pay over £200 to cancel. I was even told to ""move back to your parents house and have the line installed in your bedroom"" which would incur a £130 fee on its own! I was never once listened to and never once received any apology for the way I was spoken to by multiple members of their staff. A few months later after giving up and continuing to pay a silly amount for slow internet, due to being made homeless I was forced to cancel the contract and have since incurred their ridiculous fees of £180. They have threatened me and written me the most disgraceful letters that I have seen from any single company. Hidden charges, extras and fees left right and center. All of the rumors are true - BT are the worst internet providers you could have the misfortune of joining."
Marietta,London,1/11/15,"Actually 0 stars on all counts.

Astonished,Scotland,1/8/15,I cannot believe the customer service! I called the 0800 number to discuss my present package. I spoke to a male who continually yawned throughout the conversation and didn't appear to have a clue what he was doing/saying.I thought he was under the influence ! I put down the phone redialled and a female answered this time. Not very clear on what I was asking and couldn't multiply 12 x £1.22. She told me she wasn't a numbers type of girl ? I asked to speak to Team Leader or manager but conveniently no one was available. What awful service and quality! BT don't deserve my years of loyalty and money. I dialled the number which costs you and asked them to call back. This time I got a polite trained operative who knew what they were talking about. Will now look for an alternative after 30 years.
David Palmer,blindley heath,1/8/15,Lost internet connection on the 15ht Dec. BT do know know what is the problem. I have asked for a letter of deadlock and are taking this matter to the telecommunications ombudsmen

Gary Saunders,Norfolk,1/4/15,"I have stayed with BT for many years, and just upgraded to Infinity, when it was installed I was told by engineer, I was getting 79 mbs into my house. I was very happy after previously getting on average 3 mbs.
Engineer left, and since this I have never got any where near the 79 mbs proported. At sometimes I have even gone as low as t he old 3 - 3 mbs. Very unreliable, hub always needs rebooting. average speed is usually 15 - 20 mbs, if I'm lucky.
Spoken to helpdesks, always get overseas, who are absolutely useless. and just pass you from pillar to post and fob you off. BT, I am very unhappy with your service, but I am sick of spending hours and hours n the phone to your helpdesks.

AVOID!!!!!!!"
Jake,Ely,1/3/15,"Promised 80Mb/s but getting around 5Mb/s said there is a fault in the area for around 6 months now. Customer service is awful, you get on the phone to india and they tell you the same thing over and over again. When the internet does work, which is very rarely, it works very well with good high speeds but its reliability is shocking. If you want a bad provider that throttles you and has bad reliability, BT is for you. Otherwise, STAY AWAY!"
allypally,"Muswell Hill, Lonndon",1/3/15,"BT wifi is simply not fit for purpose. We have had it for over a year and have invested in power boosters etc, and NOTHING has worked consistently. In desperation we even invested in the £10 per month tech support service - and all they tell us is that our house has walls.... and this is what is getting in the way - who knew???

Our wifi signal is erratic, slow and sometimes non existent - but the BT tech expert always told us - ' you are connected and the signal is strong' - that may be so in the modem - but around the house it fluctuates wildly throughout the day - much stronger in the morning but deteriorating in the afternoon and evening - I'd accept the 'walls' explanation if the signal was consistently useless - but it is not. BT are using ancient copper wire technology which too many users are having to access - we are returning to Virgin next week and cannot wait. BT should be ashamed of themselves and we should be given a refund. And their Tech support service should start telling the truth!"

2nd January and still have no phone line or Broadband.
Have to deal with Indian call centres who then have to call BT in the UK who then have to call Openreach who actually do the installations.

Wish I could give zero stars. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."
Michael,London,1/2/15,"I tried to swap from Virgin to BT. Two engineers arrived fitted the router. But after they left I discovered that my phone was not working and I did not have Infinity 2 which I had ordered but a much slower version.

After being on the phone every day for over a week during which time I was assured that I was not a customer of theirs, then that my account had been closed I finally got them to say that I did actually exist and that they would send the engineers back to fix the phone and install the Infinity broadband I had ordered.

The date came for the final installation. No engineers arrived. I phoned BT. They said it had been cancelled possibly by some computer fault. They then said that I would then have to go back online to re-order as the offer I had been given was not available by phone.

I said I wanted to go back to Virgin but they had to fix my phone line. They said as this was not part of a broadband installation they would have to charge over £130 for this despite my protests that it was their engineers that had caused me to be without a phone for more than 2 weeks and with inferior BT broadband for the same time.

The only positive thing to say that at this point and with many hours wasted I asked if their cancellation meant that any contractual obligation I had to BT was at an end? They said yes.

I am now back with Virgin.

If this is what BT are like when they are trying to get your business what must they be like when they have you locked in a contract? Avoid at all costs. This was perhaps the worst customer experience I have ever had with a major company."
Joanna Clyne,Cheadle Hulme,12/31/14,So glad I found this review site as it's clarified I'm not imagining how poor BT services are. For the 16 months I've been complaining of drop out broadband unable to use BT email mail lost BT sport freezing constant lies and fob offs from call centres an engineer came before Christmas and confirmed the cause of the trouble. Seems two local boxes have cards running 50 lines and my box has four faulty lines. Told me other service providers are also using that box so at any time my line has been connected to any different terminal as lines moved to 'resolve' the latest complaint. This is borne out by my bank security not recognising my IP address and other sites I use confirm my IP address has changed within hours of sorting it again. I also received a warning despite having unlimited broadband my usage was excessive. It's very obvious it's all running on a wing and prayer. 2 hrs yesterday of call centre who then also lied to uk engineering. Well BT today I decided enough is enough I've given notice I'll go elsewhere as at no time have you been physically capable of providing the service I'm paying for as your management apparently take the view ok 4 lines are duff but that leaves 46 that work and so it carries on. I'm going to chronologies events for Gavin Paterson and off com expecting a substantial refund of monies paid. I've also been told today my PAC code will be with me in 5 days time. See you in Court.
Torvil,"Stone, Staffs",12/31/14,"I'm getting the impression customer services are hiding/running away from me.
I've been a loyal customer for years for both telephone and broadband.
We have just had fibre band trunked to our village and whilst waiting for the endless failed installation dates I decided to review my contract with BT on the promise that I would be able to upgrade to fibre when it eventually came. It came in November and BT have just slashed the cost accross the Internet. Nowhere does the advert state ""excludes existing customers"" the usual BT con. When you attempt to order it (on line only) you are asked to enter your land line etc when suddenly the price jumps from £10 to £24. I called BT sales who tried but couldn't explain either.
BT like so many other companies who don't want to contacted make it so difficult for people to email them by putting dreams and reams of smokescreen and diversive links to divert us away from the ""email us"" links. They lodged a complaint on my behalf and said I would get a follow up call. I've heard nothing. BT provide an appalling customer loyalty programme when it comes to upgrades and renewing contracts. Where are you? Why are you hiding and avoiding me?
When are you going to start treating customer retention as a priority rather than taking advantage of the hassle of migrating to their competitors?"
James,East Finchley,12/30/14,"This internet speed is worse than in my home in South Africa. Do not go with this service as you will regret it. Netflix streams in the lowest quality, webpages take ages to load and iTunes downloads can take an hour for one song! DO NOT GO WITH BT! This is a warning."
PhilA,manchester,12/29/14,"Very expensive. The Broadband upgrade we received is slower than the package we were on before... and the connection keeps dropping too. Customer Service were poor when we called for a price review, they said they couldn't offer us a better package even though they advertise better packages online. BT has not changed and is still a money grabbing organisation with only its shareholders in mind and they simply do not care about their customers. The products are poorly made and the new menu guide on BT Vision is far too complicated compared to the previous version. Poor products, poor service, overpriced."
phil,Brixham,12/29/14,"The problem with these review sites is that people only post to them if they are having problems, hence the peer ratings here are completely un-representitive. I thought I'd provide some balance. I ordered Infinity 2 as an upgrade to my existing BT ADSL, the modem arrived on the promised day, and the service was provisioned on time. At the time of order I was told that I was likely to get a speed of about 50Mb/s, the connection speed I actually get is 70Mb/s, the connection is completely solid and so far there have been no slow-downs or dropped connections. The BT homehub 5 provided has the latest ac WiFi technology, so all my devices get the full 70Mb/sec over WiFi from most rooms in the house. I am therefore very happy with all aspects of the service."
Keith telford,telford,12/26/14,"I would like to say that from the time I was given infinity free for a year I stayed with bt. The speed specified was upto 79 Mbps and that was achieved but my problem was the Wifi . I am using a bthub 3 and in my opinion the wifi range is abysmal. My hub is upstairs and in the room below is my sky box and broadband adaptor, every couple of hours the adapter lights are both on but my tv is telling my wifi signal may be too weak. Bt need to improve their hubs to give everyone better range and less time loosing signal."
Kevin Rotherham,Rotherham,12/23/14,"I moved to BT from Sky because Sky wasnt up to the standards I wanted. What a mistake. From day one BT was only running at 2.4mbs, instead of the 4mbs I was promised. BT said we will send out an engineer to check the line etc, but if its found to be anything that isnt BTs fault you will be charged £129. I was confident I had checked everything was ok so I allowed an engineer to come. The engineer didnt say a deal and left. NEXT Bill - yes youve guessed - £129. I rang up fuming and was told 'you switch your router off at night'. I explained that having seen a few burnt out routers on Facebook etc thats why I switched off. Ok, in fairness they did refund me.
All went well for 3 months thereafter, until a guy from BT rang me about BT infinity. I showed an interest but didnt buy, but believe me, my broadband hasnt worked correctly since. It is down now, and has been for the last 3 days. The nice guy in the Indian call centre assured me an engineer would look at my problem tomorrow. However a call 5 mins later from the same nice Indian guy was bad news - they wont be looking tomorrow after all. So its a case now of just wait.
I wouldnt recommend BT to my worst enemy. I always thought they were a reputable company with a good reputation, but having had to deal with them when things go wrong proves what a tinpot company they are. DO NOT SIGN UP TO BT BROADBAND."
g beynon,west sussex,12/21/14,
Rebecca Calvert,Lockerbie,12/20/14,just terrible. well and truly ripped off
BufferVision,Brstl,12/19/14,"Been with BT for 5 years was originally really very good - new home hub with top speed BT infinity package arrived 1 year ago & problems began - rarely reached anywhere near speeds advertised as was totally unreliable, dropping out daily in a major city which is astonishing. Never seem to accept they may have a hardware issue with there router - even though I'm stood next to it and cannot get online.

So were quietly leaving & happy to pay £30 cancellation fee to try out Virgin Media."
AH,Surrey,12/18/14,"DO NOT TAKE OUT A CONTRACT WITH BT. You have been warned.
Unreliable and unstable broadband and TV signal that required hours and hours and hours and hours of calls to them. It was never properly resolved.
Ripped off when we had finally had enough and cancelled while in contract."
Colin Kennedy,Glasgow,12/18/14,"Recently moved home and since I was an existing BT customer I decided to opt for the seemingly straightforward choice of sticking with the same company.
I called BT and told them to transfer my services to my new address (for which an engineer visit would be required) and was informed that the earliest available date would be 23rd December - a full month after moving. I said sorry but that was unacceptable and I would be seeking an alternative provider. An early date of 8th December then miraculously became available. An engineer visited and stated work needed to be done outside of the property for which another visit would be required. Thus far no one has arrived on two occasions and a third visit has been arranged for yes, you guessed it, 22nd December with services commencing on the 23rd. I have no faith that will happen.
In the meantime I have spoken to numerous BT staff who plainly have no idea what is happening as very little information seems to be recorded. I have received emails stating the customer care team would call on a certain day but no calls. It has been explained to me that I didn't receive calls because they had the wrong number, yet sent me a TEXT to tell me they couldn't contact me because of this!

So, having stated that waiting till the 23rd of December was not acceptable, I now find myself hoping that my services will be connected on that date. In my opinion I was lied to in order to retain my account. There is little or no communication between departments, trying to speak to a supervisor is a hopeless cause as it seems it's not their policy for senior staff to dirty their hands talking to customers and BT employees seem to make things up as they go along.
Unnecessary mobile calls over the past four weeks have left me out of pocket and I'm still paying for Netflix which I haven't been able to use along with xbox live.

BT are a truly woeful company who don't deserve the loyalty that many show them. I am currently seeking an alternative provider.
Do yourself a favour and do the same."
Susan,Wirral,12/16/14,Dreadful dreadful dreadful. Cut off twice by an indian call centre. Zero support. After moving home and day after supposed installation we still have no internet. Come back sky all is forgiven. Bt are absolute shockers
Jim,Bristol,12/15/14,Internet & phone went down 9th Dec. told engineer would investigate 12th Dec then told 15th now told 22nd Dec product is good but support very very poor so be warned
blakeston,plymouth,12/15/14,responded to a 12month free infinity our bill in last 2 months went up from40 to 55pounds per month was to be sorted apparently hasnt so annoyed now we are pensioners and our usage has not changed so why the 15pounds being added on what was advertised as 12months free
Benjamin Hodgetts,"Worcester, UK",12/13/14,"BT fitted a new line for free which seemed excellent. Speeds were 28MB with a low ping.

Fast forward 3 months, my sync is suddenly locked to exactly 20000Kb, ping is terrible (35 when previously 8 to UK servers).

I try over and over to speak to BT, being told someone will contact me and that they are chasing the fault. After weeks of chasing them they finally get back to me and say there's no fault and everything is fine.

Apparently is sudden 8Mb drop on my connection (30% of my total speed!) is normal and is possibly down to, and I quote ""more people connecting now"".

My old connection had a slightly better ping and would sync at 25Mb. I've moved to BT and EVERYTHING IS WORSE.

I couldn't recommend against them enough."
Clive,Tameside,12/12/14,"Good but now flawed. I like BT and have had MUCH better speeds than when I was with Sky. However, recently when I've needed help I have been treated VERY badly by customer services. I don't like being spoken to as though I was an idiot. When my contract runs out I will be looking to change providers."
Tony Bainbridge,Carlisle,12/11/14,"With a speed of 0.48mbps how can this be viewed as broadband. I was achieving similar speed using dial up many years ago but am now charged significantly more. The use of the term 'up to speed' is a con. The only comment I can make on reliability is that the lights on the hub flash regularly and I lose my connection, such as it is, so at least BT should be able to claim that that at least is reliable."
lex,west yorkshire,12/10/14,Failed promises from day one. I was told my servcies was going to start 3rd of december then they kept pushing it back uptill 15th of December. As a new customer its impossible to speak to any one. so cancelled afer reading preious reviews.
Lyndon Haslam,devon,12/10/14,"this is the worst provider iv'e ever been with, and I've been with AOL, they promise me 7meg and I'm getting just about 2 NOT WORTH £30PM"
Ross,london,12/10/14,"Just poor on all counts, £50 cancellation fee even though out of contract"
DearGodWHY,Manchester,12/10/14,"BT are shocking. No two ways about it. I have used them in multiple contexts and now I have myself a dilemma. I've moved house temporarily and work from home routinely. The area I am in is not a Virgin Media one, who frankly were incredibly good relative to the rest of the market all in. I am stuck with basically two suppliers that I'll consider, PlusNet and BT.

BT, when it works, works. That's all I have to say on that. Out of the Fibre providers who are not Virgin Media the service is often faultless, but not often enough. The thing that is stopping me signing up personally again is that I know that if something goes wrong, there will be absolutely no way of fixing it.

I don't know what 'dimension' BT work in, but their customer services couldn't be more useless. Additionally, logging a ticket just means the ticket disappears altogether. You will never get a resolution to any issue that you find and you'll not be able to cancel. So imaging signing up to an 18 month contract and 20 days in, find it stopped working as the traffic has reshaped so that you are now not getting the 76Mbps but nearer, say, 3Mbps. You're basically done for.

You can't cool off (the cool off period for BT seems to be different to everyone else, since they can't seemingly install inside that 14 day time period) and with shaping, it takes time to get to your final speed. Potentially more than 14 days. So what you pay for, you won't get and unlike other providers out there, there will be no resolution for it, other than to go to the communications Ombudsman or make a complaint to Ofcom.

Tickets getting lost has happened to me in commercial environments. So I'd be loathed to take a hit personally on this.

I was previously with Virgin Media. Relative to the rest of the market, Virgin media are head and shoulders above the rest. I can't describe how much I miss that service now.

Bear in mind the rest of the providers on the market run on BT's network, even if they've been sold some percentage of racks in an exchange, it's still BT's infrastructure. This is one of the reasons that they are also poor. In a way some of it is entirely out of their control. The question then becomes how well other providers can make their value adds work."
richard copp,great wishford,12/10/14,"BT were a good company 10 years ago. Now they cut you off at random as a result of not carrying out work they promise has been done. If you try to speak to someone (presumably to save money at no interest to their customers) you wait on automatic answerphones for 20 minutes, to get disgruntled staff who keep you waiting 20 minutes 'sorting the problem out', just co cut you off do you have to start again. etc. etc. You can never get continuity with one contact, and none of them seem to have any clue what their colleagues have said or done. Without doubt the worst communications 'organisation' I have come across. They can't even communicate with themselves. To big, & absolutely disinterested in their customers. Total lack of management organisation. Their adverts of how good they are and how they care about customers are perhaps the greatest work of fiction ever created."
Phil,Preston,12/9/14,Looks at the stars enough said !!!!!
David Smith,Glasgow,12/9/14,"Where to start. I joined BT from Sky around 2 months ago,due to my Mum having Infinity and her speeds being great. First,when the broadband is working,it's good,not great but good. My room and the kids room get very poor strength which wasn't a problem when I was with Sky. Now the big problem,the reliability of the connection. Despite having their latest Hub,the 5,my broadband drops around 10-15 times a day,which when your sons are gaming and your tv service is dependant on the internet,is a huge problem. So far,apart from being spoken to like a simpleton schoolboy,they've done nothing to address the issue. So after reading all these other terrible reviews I've decided to try Virgin. They can simply chase me for what they'll say I owe. I'm not paying for a service that is of a far below par quality.So after writing this I'll contact Virgin and see if they can offer a more reliable service. AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!"
Samir jawad,Cambridge,12/9/14,"I was charged £130 for a new line even though I had an active line .their customer service is a waste of time, they do not listen they talk like Robots. I am waiting for the end of my contract then I wiil leave BT and never consider them ever again.I will make sure none of my family or friends use them."
Chris,Lowestoft,12/9/14,"Once connection problems sorted out by engineers, great broadband and service."
James,"Midlands, UK",12/9/14,"The overall speed is poor at best (Around 6mbps if you trust the results of the test). However my biggest gripe is with their reliability of both the broadband service and their router hardware. The homehub 3 is a shocker. It basically loses connected devices, causes Resolving Host issues (constantly) and needs restarting more frquently than a Delorean. Then you try customer service and they want to sell you a new one...to replace the naff one they provided? Added to which, they want to send an engineer over who is basically there to find any reason he can to say it's not their fault and charge £80 for the pleasure of doing you over. Really bad. Really really bad."
Kevin,Leicester,12/8/14,"I have been with BT for over 3 years. Went with them because they claim to have the most reliable internet connection. This is not the case. They have one of, if not the worst internet reliabity I have ever experienced. What annoys me more is the speed and the price. There lack of customer service to long standing existing customers is disgusting. I have rang them on numerous times to discuss this but they just fob you off and don't even seemed bothered. And now they have stooped to new low. We have decided to give another provider ago and since our new provider contacted BT to arrange swapping the line etc the internet as become even more slow. I am without doubt sure they have slowed my internet further has fingers up to me leaving them.
How can company the size of BT not be concerned with losing customers who are spending over £500 a year? If only I could run my business like that.
Anyway if I was you I would try another provider."
keith Podmore,Crewe,12/6/14,"I don't leave reviews as a rule but have had enough of this terrible service,My broadband drops at least once a day(today it 's dropped 8 times)Customer service always want to send out an engineer when they have already done it (don't they know people can't keep having time off work)and found the problem is not in the house.BT did offer to compensate me for 2 days without internet .They offered a grand sum of 13p!!!All I can say is I'm going back to PlusNet ASAP"
Amy,Exmouth,12/6/14,"for three years this scum bag of a company has taken our money and failed to provide a service! Complained many times always told it was our fault eventually got to an agent who realised it wasn't our fault (a big deal with bt) and arranged a call back! Well that never happened. I'll give them until tomorrow if they don't I'll be calling asking to speak to a manager and if they can't help I'll be going to ofcom. For three years we've had broadband that is slow, unreliable and always drops out (our previous supplier never had these issues!) bt are a disgrace avoid at all costs"
Mr Mojo,Mitcham,12/5/14,"I've been with BT broadband paying for their best braodband option available Infinity 2. It's rubbish. The smartly advertised speed called UP TO ... explains it all. It's almost never there. Customer service is also a joke. And process of leaving BT too. It is also a pain in the ""A"". They will tray to charge you £30 just for leaving them even if you have served your full contract term. They will charge you for everything even for payment processing pretty much like Ryanair does. On the top of that I think that BT should be reported to the Watch Dog and Office of Fair Trading for dishonest advertising, They are advertising that their Infinity 2 broadband is a Fibre Optic Broadband which is not truth as its only HALF Fibre Optic Broadband!!! The only fibre optic cable there is the one that runs from local BT exchange box into your house but all cables running to that local BT exchange box are old copper cables. The only UK 100% Fibre Optic Braodband is from Virgin. BT? No thank you !"
mick,hinckley,12/4/14,"After agreeing that a BT engineer would install a new line and telephone box into my house as part of me joining BT. The BT engineer never turned up and I was emailed to say that my service was switched on via an old BT line I had years earlier used for business in my house. I contacted BT so they could correct their mistake. They denied all knowledge of the agreement, stated T&C about general installation and said that to move a box would cost me from £130 -£200 (the figure varied depending on which department I spoke with). Not one department could arrange for an engineer to correct their mistake. An engineer explained that as they were a different part of BT they couldn't correct faults of other parts of BT. In the end I was advised to try again tomorrow when maybe there might be someone who could take responsibility. Thankfully I'm still within my 14 day period. My advice don't trust them."
edward bishop,brentwood,12/2/14,"I've used more swear words since using BT moving house service, than ever before.
Just when you think they can't get any worse they suprise you.
They are very good at charging you for services you didn't have, or didn't want, then charge you again for cancelling them."
Jacky,Wales,12/1/14,"Terrible broadband, terrible customer service. Do not touch BT they are a disgrace."
Leonard McNeill,"Argyll, Scotland.",12/1/14,"Having been with another company for over 25 years I transferred to BT Broadband. Before doing so I asked and was told that I could ask, if it ever became necessary, to speak to someone whose first language was English - no need to say anymore about that (And I have no prejudices) it's just that I'm not a qualified English teacher! So after three different contracts I eventually got my equipment. BT admin is a total disaster. Things have been going along reasonably smoothly, apart from when they tried to blackmail me into signing up again for 12 months in order to get BT sport. But FINALLY - for some unknown reason I recently received my latest email bill from BT. When I tried to have a look at this - instead of the usual pages coming up I was informed that I would have to register with a new BT ID. Now my troubles really started. I spent 1 hour and 20 minutes trying to explain to a person whose first language was not English that I was quite content with the system that I had been using for the past 25 years i.e. Outlook Express. I asked to speak to the line manager but he was too busy so it was arranged that a person from the next level up would phone me to resolve my problem. This WAS done and the level 2 agent spent over 20 minutes with the system so that I would continue getting my email via Microsoft Outlook Express. Needless to say this hasn't happened. Now I can only get my email through the BT server, using a BT email system and already I am getting spam that I've avoided for over 20 years and, into the bargain, I'm also now getting BT ads for other companies that presumably pay BT for the privilege. BT ARE A CROWD OF MONEY MAKING GANGSTERS _ DON'T EVER SIGN UP TO THEM!!!!!!!"
Rob Greenslade,Weston SubEdge,12/1/14,"I live in Weston SubEdge Chipping Campden, a relatively affluent Cotswold Village where the clock has been retarded to Victorian times by BT.

The phone and broadband services, patchy at the best of times, have, since last Monday disappeared; with no update as to when they will be fixed. Local businesses, medical-service dependent pensioners and GCSE students can't access vital services. There has been no Black Friday or Cyber Monday in Weston SubEdge. Several hundred homes are affected.

I hear on the jungle drums that BT is unable to fix the problem until 20th December, almost a month without service.

Today they put BT line rental bills up.

Classic monopoly with rubbish customer service. How can we affect their NPS? Affecting their bonuses may be the only way to get them to listen."
StevieP,West Sussex,11/29/14,"I have BT's best for around here, 80 mbps. I'm lucky to be very near the cabinet and I actually get close to that speed, 74 to be picky. I did however have some problems in the months following it's installation, with speed. It would drop by 50% or more every 3-4 days and required a reset of the router to fix it.I noticed that it never dropped below that speed. I got fed up and suspected that BT were taking the Michael; charging me for 80 and supplying 35. Let's face it most people wouldn't notice! I complained about this and got a phone call telling me the line was fine and the problem was ""static electricity build up on the router"" and that I would have to continue to do a reset when speed dropped. What sort of modern equipment would be susceptible to that? I guess he was reading from a crib sheet. HOWEVER since my complaint a strange thing has happened. Not once since, and it's more than 6 weeks now, has the speed dropped. Not once! Static build up my derriere!"
Angel Perez,London,11/28/14,I have been on BT Broadband since 2001. They are now the worst I have had since broadband started. Today email is down when email is up you have 15 minutes before it times out and you have to re log on. I asked the help desk somewhere in England and they said that's it that's how it is going to be. At my job we are going to drop BT that includes phone lines. I am sure they left Yahoo to save money big mistake. I would have paid more to stay in it
Sean Devine,Rotherham,11/28/14,I signed up to BT and I can honestly say I found them a very reputable company. There customer service was excellent & very open to reason when it came to a complaint. I only left because I found a cheaper package which sadly BT couldn't match at the time. Sadly not long after I left BT they rang & offered me a cheaper deal than what I was originally paying. But I had already paid my up front line rental with my new provider. I'm hoping the ISP I'm with now will live up to its expectations. If not I would gladly return to BT even though it ment I was paying a little more. I've read some of the bad reviews BT have received. But I can only go on my experience with them & I would personally recommend them.
Adam,Griston,11/27/14,"Absolutely pathetic. The broadband here was never going to be quick but they way the village is treated is unbelievable! BT Infinity has been put through the village so that the town next to us could use it, but they didn't let us! Now all of a sudden my internet has dropped down to 130kbs. That's disgusting, and BT will do sweet F A about it. Disgusting company who genuinely don't care as long as they are making a profit."
Sarah,Fife,11/25/14,"Appalling!.. I live in a small cottage and cannot get a signal. Have to reboot on average 6 times per day. Only been with them since September, biggest mistake. Cannot leave and change providers as they want to charge me £295 termination fee, even though they are NOT providing the service I am paying for!
Shocking!"
Alexis Papapetrou,London,11/25/14,"I have been using BT Infinity for a year and a half. When I had to move houses i called BT to cancel my contract, the person i talked to told me that there would be a £37 cancellation charge on top of my regular monthly bill. After that it all went wrong and BT kept emailing of outstanding bills that kept changing and no one was able to give me an explanation. I am overall very disappointed at the end of the day i had to pay what they asked in order for my account to close as it affected my credit score. I was harassed to pay a bill that made no sense because i had no choice. Would definitely NOT recommend, there are other companies out there that might have problems too but at least half as expensive on the monthly bills."
Vicky,Co. Durham,11/25/14,"Have had BT Infinity 1 fibre optic broadband for a while now and never had any problems with it, speeds I am getting are comparable with Virgin and wi-fi has been more reliable. Customer service has been good too when I've had need to raise a query."
Jamie king,Northampton,11/24/14,I recently took out bt infinity and although the speed test connections say I'm getting 35mpd all my devices struggle to open any web pages and streaming is almost impossible. I contacted bt about this and they was next to no use telling me that I'm getting the download speed they say. I'm very disappointed with infinity and will be going back to my standard connection as soon as I can as I found the connection far quicker. I would defiantly not recommend bt infinity to anyone
Richard A,East Sussex,11/23/14,"The worst company I've had to deal with: terrible customer service, terrible broadband speed, terrible reliability & terrible hardware (hub 3 router). How this monopoly is allowed to get away with this is amazing. Not only that but they lie. Almost once a year the phone line & broadband goes down usually for at least a week. Its always for the same reason: crumbling wiring & switchgear in the road outside. Their own engineers have told me that the repeated problems are because BT won't spend the money to upgrade the 1970's aluminium cabling etc (not even copper). A few weeks ago it was down for 2 weeks. I received almost no information or updates. When I repeatedly complained that there was no evidence in the area of any work being done to repair it I was told that the fault was a major problem at the exchange & was affecting a large area & was taking longer to sort out. Sure enough a van appeared in the road outside our house on the 14th day & within 3 hours it was fixed. When I asked about the 'major problem at the exchange' the engineer said he nothing about that & he was just sent to fix a problem in the road outside."
Ozgur K.,Cambridge,11/22/14,"Broadband speed is very slow. Wanted to upgrade to Infinity and ordered and then BT has cancelled my order saying that it is not available in my area. Then, BT called me again and said Infinity is available and I ordered again. Guess what they cancelled again. When I check on their website with my phone number and postcode it says Infinity is available. As I live in a new development area I had to use this terrible service for ages."
Pascal,Edinburgh,11/22/14,"After recently moving house I’ve ended up with BT Broadband. They sent me a Home Hub which is a dreadful bit of rubbish, have recently reverted back to my old NetGear router. One of the issues I had with the BT hub is that BT seem to mysteriously do stuff to it remotely, and there is a distinct lack of user configuration tools, unlike the NetGear which the user has complete control of.

Have had major issues with their Parental Controls stuff. I have not enabled this, but every so often a message pops up advising me to switch it on, with no way of dismissing the message and getting back to the site I was accessing. I eventually phoned their help desk in India and was treated like an idiot. I said I wanted nothing to do with ‘Parental Controls’ as there are no children in the house but was told it’s a government order that all users will be hassled to switch the stuff on in 2014.

BT service levels are practically non-existent with the Indian call centres a total joke.

I keep getting letters from them advising me to move to Infinity broadband for more speed. But I’m connected to the Rose Street exchange which is not fibre enabled, and BT have no plans to do so as they say it’s not economical for that exchange.

So in conclusion would avoid BT if that is possible. If this Parental Control issues is not sorted soon I’m going to ditch BT broadband. But either way I’m stuck with them as they own the copper lines from the exchange. Sooner or later the government is going to have to bite the bullet and fund a project to re-wire the UK and provide fibre to every house."
Afi,London,11/22/14,"Absolutely appalling customer service. Had ongoing Broadband problem for months. Was told a manager would call me back on 3 different occasions. Waited in specially only to receive no phone call as promised. This is after spending a ridiculous number of hours on the phone to BT and getting absolutely nowhere. Fed up of their ridiculous repetitive scripts, complete lack of knowledge and utter lack of decent customer service. Finally taking my business elsewhere!"
d & k,hereford,11/22/14,"Bt hate customers.
Spent 3 weeks trying to get an engineer out. When I managed to book one he did not turn up. Waited another week and had a visit and was told it was fixed. In this time internet dropping out for days at a time or so slow unusable. Still not fixed. Rang call centre again who refused to request another engineer to visit as we were 'long line' i.e. rural. Had broadband for many years at this address so why can't they sort it now. They dont listen to what you say, just keep repeating the same thing. Also they gave us the option of cancelling the service( without penalty! How generous) or carry on paying for the few minutes we manage to connect. As they are the only providers in the area we have no option but to continue paying a premium price for an appalling service. Also our neighbours (who presumably have the same length of line are able to get reasonable broadband)"
Mr Small,Reading,11/21/14,"As of today if I do not get any satisfaction from BT I will throw they equipment out of my house. Below is some of the dealings I had with BT staff from England, Scotland, Ireland and India and still nothing sorted

I would like to invite you to a problem I am having British Telecom. On the 11 July I place an order for BT to install telephone line, broadband and TV package (included with the package I would receive £60 of Sainsburys Vouchers) as I had completed my order on line. I then contacted one BT staff on telephone number 0800800150 to confirm my order and told the young man that I wanted to bring my telephone number from virgin media with me to which he agree I could do that he also said that I did not need to do anything as BT would contact Virgin media to close my account and at the same time get the telephone number over from them he also confirm that there was a BT line at my property and a date was agreed for installation on the 24 July 2014.



On the 24th July 2014 two work men arrived and spent sometime trying to find a line into the building eventually their left and said someone would contact, but no one contacted me so I call them a couple of days later ended up speaking to number of people in India who did not have a clue what was going so having made several more calls later I eventually spoke to someone by the name of Lauren Atkinson in Sunderland who was very apologetic and eventually she told me that she would arrange an engineer to come out to me on 31 July 2014 she also promise that she would then call me back in the afternoon of 31 July 2014 to check everything was going alright I also made her aware that I would like to make a formal complaint about the service I was receiving and the cost of many calls I was having to keep to contacting BT on my mobile phone she also agree that I had made several very long calls to each time to India and I would be given back that money ( I never got that call she promised) so I rang again and asked for her and excuses were made that she would call me which did not happen. An engineer suddenly turn up on the 30 July 20014 and found the line to the building then left after saying someone will come to run the line into my property. Another engineer arrived the following week and connect the line in my property and after lots of calls to India once again I finally got my Internet connected (but it did work for several days) and the phone connected on the 10 August 2014, but no email address and I still do not have an email address at the time of writing this email to you. On 13 August 2014 I spoke to Kiera from Scotland who said she was sorry, but no one had contact Virginmedia about closing the account or transfer my telephone number and I would have to do this myself so the following day I contacted Virginmedia who confirm no one has contacted them form BT and that I would have to give 30 days notice (Kiera did say I could send the bill from Virginmedia to BT for them to pay it) On Saturday 23 August 2014 I rang BT and spoke to Alex I explain that I wanted to cancel the order due to it taking so long to complete , but he was very rude and aggressive and said if I cancel I would be made to pay for the full 18 months contract. Over the period of time trying to get BT to install all these items in my property I have made hundreds of calls to various people and not one of them have follow through or sorted out the installation or even calling me back when their said there would and you ask for them their never available to speak with me there and always some body new to speak and the same old apology I'm sorry I'm sorry but nothing ever got done I even try telling them their were doing a great job just to get proper service. I also was told that I cannot receive my £60 Sainsbury's voucher or any of my sports apps because I do not have a email address

On the 27 August 2014 I rang BT again and spoke to a female who told me her name was Colin - customer service from Aberdeen she admitted after reading some of my notes that I have been treated pretty badly, but could not tell when I would get my email address she also said I could not cancel on my bases that I believe BT has breach its own contract with me by not completing its installation agreement on the date 24 July 2014 or even now with me it also seems to me that much of BT staff are reading from scripts as every one them will say sorry over 20 times during the conversations, but it means nothing if you are not getting the service you are paying for BT has even have the cheek to start taking payment from account. Here are a list of some of the other BT staff I have spoken too since 11 July 2014 all at my own expenses Katie ( who mess up the very frist sign up) Shrey, Lav(the person who mess up email address), Jagriti, Roopa, Cas, Mikhail, Ankur, Zoe, Saawan, Sakshi, Minekshi, Tenzin, Sairon (told me he wasTenzin manager), David, Jim, Katie, Daniel, Arijit, Srinivas all said there will call me back and none have. Contact 31 August 2014 2x Soumyadipta, Aravind, Amrin, Sulktana, 1st September 2014 Viantha Kutti,subraja, 2nd september 2014 Tina( who was rude), Daniel (doncaster) I believe either David or Jim was the one who told me their would contact virginmedia to bring my phone number over and close account."
hM,Glasgow,11/21/14,"I have had problems with dropping connection, slow speed over the last six months. Customer service is not great. I'm fed up explaining the same problem to different people who then give me conflicting diagnosis and advice. I would encourage everyone who has similar experience to make a formal complaint, get the reference number and fill in compensation form, not so much for the compensation but to force BT to accept responsibility. Im paying for a service that they are not providing."
Paul,Nottingham,11/20/14,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE AND TERRIBLE STAY VERY VERY CLEAR. Internet speed slow, email account practically unusable for large periods of time - does absolutely nothing it says on the tin 90% of the time - worst service ever, connection speed anywhere between 0-1Mb most of the time, (is that not the same as the old dial speeds???????????) USE ANYONE BUT THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A COMPANY YOU WILL SPEND HOURS ON THE PHONE TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO MAKE YOUR INTERNET AND/OR BT EMAIL ACCOUNTS TO WORK FROM INDIA AND NEVER GET MORE THAN A FEW OPTION CHANGES AND THEN THEY WILL 'REVIEW IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME' AND YOU WILL START ALL OVER AGAIN WITHOUT EVER GETTING THE SERVICE YOU PAY FOR"
mr.wood,accrington,11/20/14,I've had bt infinity for just over a year now and no probs what so ever.Then it wouldn't connect my tablet to net so I phone up customer services.....ha what a joke.they cant speak English never mindfix the issue.tried to contact their online help desk and got no reply.So now I've got no internet and yet they are still charging me for it.issue not solved and 1 very un happy customer.Would not recommend at all
Crowsal,Shropshire,11/20/14,Switched from sky who were reliable but too expensive. 5 weeks past connection date with BT and still no broadband. Absolutely disgusting service order timed out because it took too long on there system. Order escalated without any real improvement. As they have not fulfilled the contract I am cancelling and moving to another provider. Any provider. Steer clear of BT. Not impressed at all!
David,St Austell,11/20/14,"I had infinity installed last week in my new house and it was completely unreliable.
On Monday I called them expecting to be on hold for hours, passed from person to person, etc.
I got straight through to a foreign call center. Here we go I thought.
How wrong I was. The guy was very efficient and actually listened to what I said. After he had performed a few tests his end he agreed there was a fault and escalated my case. He told me an engineer would go and check the main box and I would get a call back on Wednesday evening.
Again I was skeptical.
Anyway, on the Monday evening my broadband was completely down for an hour or so. Where they really fixing it this fast?
By Tuesday it was working much better and on the Wednesday evening, as promised, I got a call from the same call center guy asking how my service was now.
I said it seems much better. He said he would keep the case open anyway to make sure and send me a text. If I have any further problems he said to just reply to the text and BT will call me back within two hours.
I'm a little astounded. This was great service. Quick, efficient and simple.
I'm the first to give out bad reviews to companies that deliver bad service so thought I should post about how good this service was.
Well done BT."
Trisha,Stourton,11/19/14,
Art,Spennymoor,11/19/14,"Joined bt about a year ago and I have had a problem with line speeds from day one.As I write this review my line speed is only 0.84Mbps. Dispite regular complaints all I get is someone from a call centre halfway round the world telling me there is no problem with my line. I have even sent them screen shots of the results from BT wholesale speed test, to no avail. The one star rating I have given is way higher than BT deserves and once my contract is finished I will have the line removed and switch to mobile, may only give 3-4Mpbs but it is consistant 24/7. Anyone who moves to BT is insane (self included)"
A Khan,London,11/19/14,"The worst company I've ever dealt with:
- incompetent staff
- unreliable speeds
- unreliable wifi connection (the signal continually drops)

I've raised the issue of the unreliable wifi connection and been told the wfi signal is ""not guaranteed"".
I've been with BT for as long as I can remember but all I can say is the company is now in free fall. Would not recommend."
Anonymous,,11/18/14,
Rob Booth,Leyland,11/18/14,Having been a BT customer since 2010 I have now got so fed up with their new customer offers that I have contaced them to cancel with the aim of moving to Plusnet and then returning in a year. However because I have a £1.31 discount till June 2015 they want to charge me £130 to leave - thats 10 years of the discount which in itself only lasts a year. So I asked to discuss it with a manager the call centre operative flatly refused to put me in touch with one - basically these are the rules take it or leave it. so I'm stuck with BT till June 2015 what a total Rip off
L I,,11/18/14,"Literally the worst company I have ever had to deal with. Their customer service team's only role is to delay you as much as possible until they fix the issue. They don't call you back, they pass you from one member to another so you have to keep repeating yourself. They make you repeat tests you have already done 5 times in the past day. The company can't keep a stable connection for more than 2 days at a time. DO NOT USE."
Paddy,Doesn't Matter,11/17/14,"BT is the slowest broadband service out there. Anyone reading this please heed this advice (Or you'll regret it). AVOID at ALL costs.

I used to be on TalkTalk a few years ago in my old home and my internet connection was 54Mbps.

With this 54Mbps broadband I was getting seriously good browsing speeds.

Not only was I getting good browsing speeds, but streaming live video content, like sports etc, was effortless.

I was also able to download torrent files at a rate of 2Mb/s.

I judge how good/fast my broadband is by Peer to Peer (P2P) speeds.

Fast forward 3 years and I have moved home and changed ISP.

Switching is the biggest mistake I EVER made.

I am on the Unlimited broadband package; and am getting a 144Mbps connection (Over twice what I was getting on TalkTalk).

Strangley; my internet browsing is super Sloooooow, watching a Youtube video takes about 2-3 minutes to load and keeps freezing, so I have to keep refreshing.

My torrent download speeds are maxed out at 700kbs (Over 3 times slower than with TalkTalk)."
Decker,Blackburn,11/17/14,I thought BT was a premier supplier we what a disappointment. Suffered 4 months of poor service after numerous calls engineers working on i still have a problem. Basically the product is not fit for purpose and you have to pay extra to sort their faulty product. Stay well away from BT
Iain Geddes,Nairnshire,11/17/14,"Completely screwed up my house move transfer, multiple calls to no avail... I wish I had an alternative!!"
w.sir,England,11/17/14,how can bt say they have fibre optic when the cables they laid many moons ago was not fibre optic unlike virgin who have laid fibre optic hence how virgin are able to have fast broadband speed bt only have a little bit of fibre optic running from the big green box somewhere near your house then they fit another tiny bit of fibre optic into your house but the bit in the middle is not fibre optic so it can only be as good with what's there 2 good bits at the end won't make the bit in the middle any better because its not fibre optic because they have never dug up old cable to replace it with fibre optic so there for bt are fooling you all and should be taken to trading standards for false advertisement think about it people don't get ripped off by these fat greedy cats
nikos,manchester,11/16/14,
bigedd,derbyshire,11/14/14,DON'T make the mistake of choosing BT fibre optic 2 (not like the advert!) - mine runs like a snail and I am told you can only get super fast if ethernet connected and no other devices??? That's certainly not what they advertise!!They don't want to know you once they've ''hooked'' you into the 18 month contract (at £28 per month)!!! Seriously look around but avoid this mess I've got!
Tracy,Birmingham,11/13/14,Completely useless avoid like plague. We arrange to swap to infinity it doesn't work And I work at home so will be billing them for loss of earnings and a refund on time without it. You have to wait a day to book a call to test it BEFORE an engineer gets involved. t.......ers
Helen Whitehead,Wiltshire,11/13/14,"Awful company, terrible communications, don't respond to email complaints, didn't send out equipment, never checked installation, have charged me for a free service, despite me telling them several times I don't even want that service, charged twice for equipment, just a mess. Never get to talk to the same person, broken promises of resolution. Their hub stopped connecting to my PC after 20 mins, not any better signal than Virgin. Seriously, if you like good customer service, best just to avoid."
Mark,Hailsham,11/13/14,"All I wanted to do was move house and take my telephone and broadband with me - Sounds simple, well it was until I had to change my moving in date.
Phoned BT up and spoke to India, said I needed to change my moving date but Bless them, turned out they only changed the installation date and not the cut off date at my old property. Found out when first my broadband went and then the telephone. Had to then use my mobile to call them up but for some reason I couldnt have my broadband back, so for almost a month on dongles.
Three months later I think I've got my £130 charge for moving refunded but will have to watch this space."
who,UK kent,11/13/14,"My experience over a number of years has been in short a very very very bad one with BT. Lies, poor service and that's putting it nicely, slow speeds, faults that take months to fix while being fed lie after lie by people who are not qualified to be in a position to provide tech advice or support. BT senior management are a joke and in my opinion a waste of our money. This isn't a problem that affects few it is massive and has been going on for years. BT don't bother with them they are your worst nightmare, don't lets get going on BT India support, why not just take my money BT and kick me in the balls cos that's what your doing to 10000s."
Adam,Bath,11/12/14,"I ordered a BT infinity student deal for 9 months, at the time seemed perfect, short contract and quick speeds. However we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer, this is normal, I would like to say that it is now 7 weeks after I orginally ordered their service yet I am STILL waiting for them to sort out our internet, and better still they have charged me £58 so far without providing anything! They have sent out 4 engineers who haven't been able to sort a supposedly simple process. Ive had 8 engineers booked, but 4 never showed up. I've spent countless hours on the phone to their terrible customer service who make false promises (I have actually heard unprompted promoises from them), half of them don't even know what their talking about!

I'm now 7/11 weeks through my first semester at university where internet is very important, not only have BT had a detrimental effect on my study, they've caused my housemate and myself to run over our mobile phone data bills, I understand this isn't their direct fault, but there are somethings like checking university timetables and sending emails that are necessary, but where we are used to having our phones connected to WiFi, we're now running over our bills costing us more money.

I thoroughly recommend you to not go for BT, yes every company has cases where things go wrong, but when things go wrong with BT, you're better off instantly switching provider. I am beyond angry with them."
Davy,Ayr,11/9/14,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE

Phoned up BT to as I had a problem with my chromecast connecting to the hub, i knew what needed to be done to fix it, change the wireless band from 5ghz to 2.4ghz, was talking to the lady on the phone and she didnt seem to understand how the hub worked, i seemed to know more about it and she is a ""technician"", as I was asking her questions she couldnt answer she was beginning to not make sense, just saying anything that came into her technical head, she could not get off the phone quick enough and was very rude and not one bit helpful

TERRIBLE!!!"
Anonymus,suffolk,11/8/14,"It took BT 3 weeks to put on my broadband! They said a few days, then another few days, then a week, and then another week and so on.. I hate BT and wish i had never got it!!"
TiptreeJam,"Colchester, Essex",11/8/14,I have been a BT customer for 30 years. Recent problems started when they moved my email from Yahoo to BT. Weeks of problems accessing email and now lost access completely when trying to link email to my BT Id. Spent an hour on the phone with an engineer taking over my computer. Problem their end but he could not fix it. Complained by letter and tried the fix they suggested but still no joy. Now lost access to my BT account. Can log in using my BT id but it says because of technical problems they cannot show me my account details. Complained but no word yet when it will be fixed a week later. Of course the prices all go up in December. Now looking to leave BT. Have already moved to another email service provider. They seem to be spending all their money on TV sport rather than telecoms.
Michael,Derbyshire,11/6/14,"I have had numerous problems with BT over the last 20 years or so. Both phone and internet.
I now have a situation where my phone is dead and my usual 2.4mbs download speed has reverted back to .75 mbs (yes point seven five!).

BT have said there is a fault on the line and they say they plan to fix it within 3 days. They think this is acceptable. It isn't.
They have also said they have tried to call me yet they know the landline is dead and my mobile hasn't rung or reported any missed calls. They lie basically.

When the system is working it works pretty well but when it breaks they automatically assume you broke it. Even when they grudgingly admit the fault is at their end they won't tell you what the problem is or how it got broken in the first place.
Then they arrogantly tell me I'm booked in for a call on Friday (3 days from reporting the fault). Well if I tell them I'm going to book them in for a visit to their head office I doubt they would be dropping everything and cancelling their corporate days out in order to greet me. I won't be waiting for their call either. Especially as the phone isn't working!

This is the most infuriating company I've ever had to deal with. It's automated systems are labyrinthine, it's customer care people lie to you, and it cares for nothing except it's profit margins.

Appalling."
maxwell taylor,Birmingham,11/5/14,Alway buffers I have to keep reseting my Internet I wouldnt recommend thsi to anyone unless u want to be waiting half an hour to watch a 5 minute you tube video
Charlotte,Newport,11/5/14,"BT have been offering a fantastic deal on broadband in our area, so we signed up and had our hub delivered. No luck with installation so called the helpline who escalated the problem. Another two calls later and an engineer was sent to the house. His first comment was ""there is no broadband in this area so I don't know why they keep sending me here"". Don't you think BT would stop wasting people's time, its not rocket science."
Bradley,United Kingdom,11/4/14,"Constantly being harrassed by a 3rd debt recovery company employed by BT after satisfying the first 2 companies that the disputed debt is not valid, basically I cancelled via telephone last November and was billed for several months after. Written two letters directly to BT. No response."
Irene,Reydon Southwold,11/2/14,Broadband speed is awful
Graham Read,N. E Wales,11/2/14,"If it works, then it's fine but have had 15 weeks without service this year (so far). Most of that was due to a phone line that was broken between two posts. At the moment, the broadband comes and goes. When it's gone, BT start by asking what I've changed - or implying fault in my wiring. Miraculously, without my doing anything in the house, broadband comes back on. Failures usually coincide with work at the local phone exchange; where one genius cut the line to our property, because 'He thought it was unused. They need some technical help."
Bruno,Exmouth,11/1/14,"2 months ago I've moved in, started with a normal DSL pack after a month I saw that it was very slow so I upgraded to BT Infinity 1, the speed tests continue with the same download speed and upload speed,
4 days ago, there was an planned outage in my area to ""upgrade"" the speed of my connection, so I've called BT since I had no internet since the morning, they said there was a planned outage until the next morning, 2 days passed and still no internet, called BT there is still a planned outage going on.... next day called again, for my surprise the planned outage was over and I had no internet so after 30min they opened a case to escalate to the 2nd line team, witch called in the morning so was fast, the guy called me (today) to check if there was still no internet, which I confirmed, after 5 minutes he calls me back saying that there is a problem and they need to send an engineer, next available date 10 November, so, after 4 days with no internet because of a 'planned outage' I still have to wait more 10 days for an engineer... to come and check my house.. which was good before the planned outages, me as a new customer I'm really disappointed with this type of service, expertise and customer service, as soon as possible I will definitely change to another provider."
Frank Odell,Wilton near Pickering,11/1/14,"What BT don't realise is the younger generation growing up with mobile technology. In 20 years tops they will all be out of a job, hopefully, because they will not want landlines. With mobile companies giving 10gb of data, they won't want bt crap or the crap they spurt out at you.
I hope I'm still here so l can laugh at them like they laughed at me when l took my contract out.
1 mile away they have 35mb yet l still paid the same price for 100kb if l was lucky. BT are just con men who should be reimbursing people who can't get what the bt site says. According to bt website today 1st November 2014 l should get between 1 and 3.5mb. Total bollocks. Lying 2 faced shots. STROLL ON THE DEMISE OF BT."
Jerome O'Mara,London,11/1/14,I would like to know what idiot decided that the new BTmail should time out in 15 minutes. I am the CIO of one of the largest companies on earth that use BT. We have decided to drop them they will find that out in less than a week.
Croc Dundee,Dundee,10/30/14,"Keep clear of BT! I was with them years ago and their customer service was so poor I left for Sky. A couple of years ago I decided to give them another go. The speed and reliability was dodgy to say the least, so it wasn't really worth watching anything on TV so I decided to go back to Sky. I tried to cancel everything, but they only did one thing at a time so I have to phone separately to cancel TV, then Landline and Calls, then Broadband, then BT Sport. It was absolutely ridiculous and time consuming. Then after a month they tried billing me again, so I had to phone twice to get it sorted, which I was promised it now was. Then a month later I was billed again, so I phoned again and was promised it was again sorted. Then a month later, after cancelling my Direct Debit, they billed me again and tried to charge me a fee for not paying. Finally after 3 months and NINE phone calls, it appears that they have finally stopped stealing from me and attempting to charge me for a service that I don't have.

I always give companies two chances and if they screw them both up I will never return and try my hardest to make all my friends and family never use them again. BT has now joined British Gas on the ""never use again"" list!"
matthew,bristol,10/28/14,"worst customer service I have ever experienced, it takes around 5 attempts just to try and speak to a human being then they don't care or act on what you ask for"
Bob,Dorset,10/28/14,"Like most providers they sell you a package that quotes an ""up to"" speed. I was sold speed ""up to 17Mb/s"", what I have got is maximum of less than 8Mb/s and a minimum speed that is so slow it will not even load the speed test!!!!!"
Craig,Measham,10/24/14,"I've been a BT customer for a while now, probably around two years, and I would definitely NOT recommend them to friends and family. Over the two years that I have been with BT I've had a number of problems with both internet speed, connectivity and rude staff.

When I first got BT installed I had no problems at all. Then, after about a month, my internet speed plummeted and was barely usable. On one occasion it took 52 hours to download a 20GB file for a PS3 game that I was trying to play. On many other occasions I was left in a mess when my internet connection was so bad I could not even submit essays for University.

When I first moved house, I was told that my BT services would be transferred and available to use by a particular date. On this date, I waited until 10pm for my phoneline to be connected but did not have a broadband connection. I waited until the following day, thinking maybe there was some kind of delay. Three days later, I still had no broadband connection so made a phonecall to see what was happening. At first I was told that I did not have a broadband deal associated with my account. I told the operator that there must have been some kind of mistake, explained the situation and was told it would be dealt with within 48 hours.

After 48 hours I still had no broadband and was relying on mobile internet (in a VERY poor coverage area) to send/receive emails. I contacted BT again and was told that there was no record of my broadband service. I explained the situation and, again, was promised action within 48 hours. ANOTHER 48 hours passed and no broadband connection appeared. I rang to complain again and ask what was happening, this time to be told that when I changed address I had removed the broadband option from my account. This was NOT the case, why would I get rid of my broadband? At this point I was told that a BT operative would look into the matter and get back to me.

When I received a phonecall the following day, I was told that my broadband service was still active at my old address and had not been moved to the new address with my phoneline. I was confused and angry at this point and demanded something be done. I was told that the only course of action was to place a new broadband order which could take up to 14 days to put into place. I had no choice but to accept and waited for my order. Due to an unknown problem, it took 21 days for my connection to be installed and, once it was installed, it did not work. I had no broadband connection at all. During one of these phonecalls, after being on hold for 18 minutes, I was talking to an adviser when she put the phone down for no reason and I was forced to ring back and wait in a queue for a further 25 minutes.

I made over 20 phonecalls to BT to get this sorted and, after nearly another week, my broadband connection was working. For the next few months I had a slow internet connection, sometimes slower than dial-up, and was told by friends and family that they could not get through to my landline number at times.

Eight months later, I moved house again. I was told that my broadband and phone service could be transferred to the new address without a problem. However, after going through the process, I was given an engineering appointment that was two weeks after I moved in. Realising there was nothing I could do about this, I waited for the appointment. I then received an e-mail stating that it was going to cost £130 on top of my normal bill to get my services transferred to the new address. This brought my bill for that month up to £210. Another obvious problem here was the cost of my bill before service charges. For the last year I have not received a BT bill for an amount less than £60 when it should only be £40. I've questioned this and was told it was because of my phone usage. I should get free evening and weekend calls but, as I can see clearly on my bill, I have been charged many times for evening calls. Sometimes up to £3 per call.

Now, after nearly a month of living at my new address I have found that the slow broadband problem has followed me! Some days I get a solid 19MB connection, other days I'm lucky if I get a 1MB connection. For the past three days I have noticed my broadband connection has been particularly slow. So slow, in fact, that it takes roughly 20 seconds for a website to load and I have to let youtube videos buffer for 5-10 minutes before I can play them.

Overall, BT have been a totally useless, terrible Internet Service Provider with bad customer service. The only reason I am still with them is because every time you move address your contract is automatically renewed for 12 months. As soon as my contract has ended I will be looking for a new ISP and warning everyone I know to avoid BT in the future."
Miss R Evanbs,United Kingdom,10/23/14,Worse company to ever have any service from. had to check my bill monthly as I was being over charged. Customer service was awful. Would not recommend anyone to choose BT.
damon,isle of mull,10/23/14,"broadband stopped working, took 2 months and lots of wasted time to get an engineer out, despite them admitting it was their fault. Having fixed it they then, without notifying, added £130 charge on to next bill for line improvements. They did remove it once I wasted more time going through their awful contact system. But whole process felt like corporate sharp practice and that they had put an awful lot of time into trying to design a system so they don't provide customer service if at all possible"
Ray,Sutton,10/20/14,"BT is great. I keep finding my self coming back to BT over and over again. The Indian call centres are lousy however, the actual internet service they provide is absolutely top notch and I have never had my connection go offline EVER. The English call centers however, are good (if you every manage to get through to them)."
Derek,Berkshire,10/19/14,
Eamonn,Surrey,10/18/14,I had been a customer of BT for a few years. Last year I suffered the slowest possible speed of any broadband ever. I contacted BT on numerous times and asked for a partial refund which they politely refused. Eventually they sent out an engineer to solve the problem so once my speed improved I decided to stay with them for another year and give them benefit of my doubt. Well from bad to absolutely awful ! Early September this year I decided to leave this so called organisation! I cancelled and got a MAC code to give to my new provider only to discover 1 month on BT are still charging me for something I do not receive. Despite numerous calls this continues so the ombudsman it is.BT have given me the worst customer service I have ever received and they blame this on my new provider apparently they never informed BT. Utter crap. BT I'd give you a zero if it were possible
Kate,Cambridge,10/18/14,"Bad customer service - I have been tied into contracts with them for the last 4 years due to house moves and them renewing my contract every time I move. At one point they wrote to me asking if they minded if they cancelled my contract because someone else wanted to use the same number as me and when I called them and said I was happy for them to cancel the contract they then threatened to charge me a penalty of hundreds of pounds because cancellation of the contract would be 'my fault'! I am now desperate to leave them and literally halve my bills for broadband and phone and they won't give me a MAC code to move my broadband. Even requesting a MAC code from them takes ages as they are aggressive when you ask for it and you have to keep repeating ""please give me a MAC code"" for 20 minutes before they will even put in the request. I am three days away from reporting them to OfCom. I will never use BT again."
ian,bs24,10/16/14,absolute rip off! terrible broadband speed . I phoned and asked bt to not renew my contract but have been told that I did not say cancel the service so now have to pay for 30 days. I'll never use this bunch of thieves again...
Sarah H,Sutton Coldfield,10/15/14,"Very poor customer service from day 1. Broadband very slow and dropped connection every day so needed to be reset.

TV recordings always missed off the end of shows which resulted in not being able to record anything properly.

I exited the contract early and took the additional cost of this to switch back to sky and after 8 calls to try and send the equipment back I ended up being charged for this. Had a rude lady on the last call tell me the charge was right even though it had been agreed I would return the equipment. Ended up paying the additional £65 rather than speak to them again."
L. Jones,Wiltshire,10/14/14,"BT offer a terrible service at a high price. Since starting a subscription with BT we have had to call customer services at least once a month. 8 months on and we are still experiencing problems with an intermittent broadband. Frustrated by calling the customer services, put on hold for over 30 minutes at a time, and constantly 'fobbed off' by an advisor. We are still waiting to receive an answer. We are now tied into a contract for 18months which is disgusting, as BT have not provided a service which they promise. In addition, we have no HD channels or a free BT Sport which was included as part of the package. Avoid this company at all cost."
Chris,Brentwood,10/14/14,"Utterly useless service. My line speed went down from about 6.5mb/s to 1.6 mb/s. After a few days of this not improving, I reported the problem and was told that BT only promissed me better than 1 mb/s and so were not even allowed to make a note of my issue. Switching to Talktalk. Oh and usual problems with indian support staff whose english is abysmal."
H Clarke,South Wales,10/14/14,Changed to this 5 months ago when engineer unpacked vision box their was no controller he fixed me up with one that seems to work but not the same as instruction book first thing book tells you is read before setting up the instructions will not work with this controller contacted Bt many times three controllers later none the same as book Bt send instructions a number of times does not suite remotes that I have instructions not book but Google downloads some with print so small and such but print out impossible to read so still cannot use box to what is its full potential perhaps I should not be surprised at there attitude as it took EIGHT years at previous address to get them to send my bills to me not the local builder STAY AWAY FROM BT anybody will give a better service than this
Roo,Cornwall,10/13/14,"Ordered infinity2. Two weeks after the order they started changing installation dates. Said I wanted to cancel, so they fast tracked my order, and promised an early connection. After booking another day off work, they cancelled that date. Have now left BT before even being connected and will wait for Sky fibre."
Ian,Dorset,10/11/14,"So took BT Vision package out including broadband etc 32 days ago. Only had their services up and running for last 6 days, poor performance so far.
Phoned BT to cancel package after trying to speak and deal with customer support that hardly spoke English. Apparently the cooling off period is 14 days after you placed the initial order, took over 3 weeks for my services to be working so how could I say I was not happy with their services? How is this even legal to be out of the cooling off period before the products even work? Now they want £469.69 to cancel total robbery.
Stay well away, shocking."
Adrian S,Newcastle,10/11/14,"Worst broadband I have ever experienced!!And they claim that BT's fibre optic broadband is one of the fastest on the market. Absolute joke. It takes an average of 80-100 sec for a page to load, never mind watching videos online. Stay away please!!!! Appalling service, poor quality, high prices."
lee wright,london,10/10/14,"Works fine if it is working. But the company has the worst customer services I have ever experienced. Hold times for technical support over an hour, engineers not turning up, rude staff and a refusal to compensate for unfixed faults. Unacceptable!"
Sue,Isle of Wight,10/10/14,"I upgraded to infinity after being badgered by BT to do so. Originally my iPad wouldn't work, bt told me it was Apple, I phoned them reinstalled everything, but eventually found it was a bt issue, now have been told by bt that my daughter's laptop is not connecting because the device has a problem ( was also given a number to phone where I could pay bt to fix it.) however, the laptop connects to the internet fine at other peoples houses. Also been told that my iPad constantly disconnects due to interference and I have to play around with changing the channels! Infinity is not fit for purpose."
Jerry Paul,London,10/9/14,"Since the new change over from Bt Yahoo to BT is is horrendous. The email if not used has to be restarted in 15 min or it times out. My email successfully switched over to BT from BT yahoo but toiday they lost all of my contacts saying I have none, U have been a customer for 15 years and will find anything at all other than them"
Ann,Reading,10/8/14,"I changed to BT broadband & anytime calls worst mistake ever my broadband is that slow it drives you mad l have called BT many times got through to India every time they are rude & can't help you at all, the only time l got through to the UK was when l said l was leaving BT which l can't do as l am in a 18 month contract when l explained my broadband was slow l was told if l wanted it any faster to change to fibre optic my reply was at your price l can't afford it plus l want you to sort out my broadband that l am paying for l then got told where l live the broadband is slow which l no is not true l called BT before l changed and was told l would get a good speed, so now l am stuck with BT until Xmas 2015 and can't do a thing about it. I have sent them emails but they just don't reply. SO BEWARE WORST COMPANY EVER"
R Phillips,Lincolnshire,10/8/14,"Absolutely appalling customer service. House move has been a nightmare, disconnected too early, left without broadband or phone. Despite multiple complaints and escalations and promise of calls back. Nothing, and they have the cheek to continue to charge me for the service."
Fiona Kinghorn,Cambridge,10/8/14,"Unbelievably poor service. Placed order two weeks ago, waited on Thurs for engineer to turn up. Didnt show, I phoned, BT promised to sort out and call Mon. By Weds still no call so I had to call back - SNAFU - nothing resolved. I hate BT"
Jason,Bristol,10/8/14,"Do not, I repeat do not take BT broadband… Customer service is non existent and I’m still waiting after 5 weeks of no connection. You get passed around, appointments are not kept and you feel you have to personally man manage every step of the process. You will spend hours on the phone all to no avail. I wish I would never have swapped provider."
elvis,devon,10/7/14,"Dreadful, abysmal, our rich language doesn't have enough adjectives to describe these clowns. Avoid like the plague."
Ms Fisher,Northamptonshire,10/4/14,"I recently asked BT to change the company name on 2 BT Business Broadband accounts we had with them. They did this for one of them (although the process was not simply, with lots of auto-generated emails confirming engineer visits etc. which were not required), but for the other account they just cancelled the phoneline and broadband completely. Any attempt by me to get them to look into this has been met by stony silence. Complaints officially submitted on-line, which were acknowledged by auto-emails saying how serious they take complaints, have had no response whatsoever. I used their 'complaint escalation' facility, and again have had no response whatsoever. If this is how they treat their business customers (bearing in mind we have had business accounts with BT for at least 9 years, and still have 1 business account with them currently), I dread to think how they treat domestic customers. I will do everything in my power to avoid buying any service from BT ever again, and advise everyone else to avoid them like the plague."
D Woods,West Sussex,10/2/14,"The worst customer service ive ever had. Will not accept its their problem for my poor speed and dispite watchdogs show will not let you leave, see you in court bt."
Craig,Chertsey,10/2/14,"I was with Sky broadband and decided to move to BT for 12 months as it was on offer for the same cost and I'd have BT sport included.
The reliability and signal strength of the router they so proudly advertise on their adverts is terrible. It has where near the range of my previous Sky router and drops connection. BT give you a 14 day cooling off period to cancel their services. The problem is it took over 14 days for the switch to take place from when I placed the order. Therefore I didn't know how unreliable their internet was until it was too late to cancel."
LD,Edinburgh,10/2/14,
SAM,NOTTINGHAM,10/1/14,the customer service really is appalling. i have used sky and virgin before who have both been very accommodating. bt customer services are rude and will do nothing to rectify problems or address issues. it is like talking to a brick wall. they keep repeating the same thing over and over again without making any inroads or compromises. its either their way or no way. i will never use them again!
Chloe,Devon,9/30/14,"Absolutely shocking! DLivery didn't turn up. Engineer didn't turn up. Left without Internet and tv for two weeks. Charged for those two weeks! Was told to wait in for another delivery, still didn't turn up. Engineer came. I was told I would not have to pay for delivery and engineer but they put it on first bill which totalled at £90....should have been around £30!
Was told I would have compensation of £55 and this we agreed could go straight into my bank. They did put the money in...then added it on to next bill!!!
Cut me off during bill dispute. Finally they agreed that after I had paid an unbelievable amount of £112 for two months that I owed nothing more. Cancelled direct debit as they kept taking money on I agreed dates. Finally set up new direct debit when they agreed all would be as it should. Less than two weeks later they demand another £65, contacted them again to sort...hours later it was agreed I did not owe the money that all would be fine. I have been cut off again because the £65 has not been paid!!! Absolute joke!!!! They will reconnect me after loosing 48hrs of connection but not reimburse the days I've been without!!! I have been sent round in circles continually in less than 3 months!!! Spending approximately 24hrs on the phone to BT and wasted 3 days at home waiting for them to not turn up."
Helen,South Yorkshire,9/29/14,
Bling,Eastbourne,9/29/14,DO Not get BT broadband speed of 0.5 download despite calling changing equipment etc now billed for 400 for breaking contract x Be AWare ripped off terribly
Chris Gibson,w2 3tp,9/28/14,Absolutely appalling service since recent change.. Spent a long time composing an email this morning as tricky only to have it erased for no given reason as timed out. Totally unacceptable.Any recommendations for better service. Can't be others worse.
Andy,Worcester,9/28/14,
Peter,"London, Wood green",9/26/14,"Call bt to get issues checked out, no phone, no internet and tv. Just stopped working with no changes made.

Send out first engineer, checks the line to the house. Yeah ok to the house, I don't check phone or internet connections in the house. You need to raise a call with bt to get the someone else to check those. marks the call as resolved.

call get case reopened, send out the second engineer a few days later, doesn't knock says no one is home with house full of people waiting for them, marks the call as resolved.

call get case reopened, send out the third engineer. Turns up and fixes the issue. no note were added.

call to try and find out what was fixed, say the fixed the phone, internet and tv by fixing the router and that the unit was incorrectly connected which was causing the issue.
Phone plugged directly into the bt socket still failed to work previously, but fixing the internet router mysteriously fixes the phone line. It's an out right lie, purely done to make £129 call out fee, not happy."
Nina,Bath,9/26/14,"Horrendous experience with BT. Don't go with them. They said they'd give me vouchers when I joined. Didn't. Just phoned up - they have a recording of the guy telling me I can have them, and they won't give them to me or the equivalent of them?????? They lied to get the business, overcharge, and they are so so so unprofessional on the phoen. Don't trust a word they say. Go with someone else."
david,hertfordshire,9/24/14,Signed up for infinity broadband and my monthly bills went up from around £25 per month to £80 +. Apparentently wrong call package added. They are not interested in rebating extra money taken me. very poor and not going to encourage any customers to stay after the minimum period.
Pand,Nottingham,9/23/14,"My broadband rarely works, it's been unusable for months and now my phone line has stopped working. bT have sent engineers out, it worked for a week, now it's a problem again."
kate,skelmersdale,9/23/14,"Frustratingly bad experience. Two appointments required to re-activate a line, and second to install broadband - arbitrarily changed by BT to two different days. Asked to be called when the engineer and told this was not possible. Waited in all morning for the engineeer to arrive but he was a no-show. Called BT and could not speak to anyone who could shed any light on the situation, merely put through to an automated message, telling me everything on track. Absolutely no way I could recommend this company, and can find no positive comment to make about them."
Paul,Shoreham-by-Sea,9/20/14,"Joined BT from SKY last year because SKY was getting too expensive. Wish I hadn't!

I ordered the whole package with BT online at the end of September with one of their offers. Got an email confirming order. A few weeks later when should've been installed nothing happened and nobody turned up. They had lost the order which meant I had lost the special deal and price and they said (more or less) its hard luck!

I complained and eventually got the original offer and more with their top fibre optic broadband.

When it was all installed and up and running I couldn't believe that I had been paying SKY'S high prices for so long because the broadband speed was brilliant (for a short while) and the TV was just what I wanted with a few extra channels and BT Sport.

However, that feeling didn't last long! The BTTV box kept freezing between channels and had to be rebooted and reset every day. I had my 5th TV box about a month ago but and its still rubbish. The software has not been thought about properly and is not up to running the box.

Numerous engineers have visited checking everything but nothing has really been accomplished.

Fibre optic broadband started off good but then started dropping out numerous times every day. BT say that up to 10 'drop offs' a day are acceptable. Normally, that wouldn't have been that much of a problem but because BT Sport and the extra channels(SYFY, FOX, COMEDY CENTRAL ETC) are received over the internet, it means that these are unavailable until broadband is back up and running. It also means that if any of those channels are set to record during a drop out, then the recording fails! Many BT Outreach engineer visits later and 3 replacement Homehubs and the problem still occurs. Usually every afternoon for some reason.

I have spent tens of hours on the phone to BT support and have had a slight bit of compensation for one month.

A few weeks ago I decided that enough was enough and told BT that I wanted to be released from my contract because of their lack of service to me, and they agreed that they would not hold me to term but I would have to give them 30 days notice. I gave them that notice verbally during that telephone call and they said they would confirm everything in writing soon after. I then decided to join Virgin Media and agreed to an 18 month contract with their 'Big Kahuna' bundle.

I got a letter a few days later stating I would have to pay BT an extra £101 pounds because I was leaving before the end of my contract!!!!

I phoned them and explained that they had agreed to let me leave before the end of my contract but they said there is nothing on file about that. I then asked that they should listen to the recording of the phone call when this was agreed unless it had 'conveniently' been lost. They said that if there is a dispute with this and the recording had gone missing then the decision will go with the customer, so I will have to wait and see what happens.

I can't say that I would recommend BT to anyone after my experience."
JOE,HALSTEAD,9/19/14,"After moving to a new house this year my wife and I decided to give BT a try after leaving sky, However this wasn't quite as easy as first thought? After three failed attempts to have the service installed and I don't know how many phone calls my wife had had enough, Not only have we lost money for her taking time off work but left us without any broadband and phone, To add insult to injury they now want to charge me £170 for the pleasure!! After more lengthy phone calls to Asian call centres (who by the way lie through their teeth) to try and resolve this issue they refuse to transfer me to anyone of seniority and hung up on me on more than one occasion! When I did finally get through to a English call centre to explain we had cancelled the service before the 29 day period they apologised and offer £20 refund and would have packaging sent for the return of their equipment GREAT. No not so great this again was just another lie so.....more phone calls no notes on their system of previous calls and guess what? Yes another bill came through. I am so livid with this company and would advise extreme caution should you chose to use them (note names times and dates you call them because they don't) for a big company the service is abysmal and they have caused massive stress to my pregnant wife and myself, This is to add to the loss of my mother to terminal cancer and my father in law suffering a massive stroke. My account number is-GB13404066 but expect this will be fully ignored as per previous attempts, Oh and before we end this review I have returned to SKY who did everything they said and haven't let me down once. So to sum up thanks a bunch BT."
Kieran,Cardiff,9/18/14,"Never had any problem with reliability or speed. I understand that some areas have really poor signal due to the lack of fibre optic broadband, however this is being addressed by the Government and Openreach so it is a case of sitting tight and waiting. Customer service was very friendly when there was an issue of switching payment methods. This compared to Sky 2 years ago is a million miles better."
Fred,Edinburgh,9/13/14,"THE most dreadful customer service I have ever experienced when moving house recently. They were never able to deliver broadband for us, continued to bill us monthly after we cancelled our order and even threatened that our credit rating would be damaged if we didn't pay up. It wasn't resolved until we threatened legal action against them when finally different departments started communicating. I will never choose BT ever again and this was after 20 years with them. Appalling treatment!!!!"
Lydia,Acton,9/11/14,"I have been trying to get the to fix a fault for 5 months. No follow up, deal with different person every time, no one calls to check whether its fixed (it isn't) no compensation despite being unable to use most broadband based services and take time off work for 4 engineer visits, won't let me out of the contract either. just woeful"
Matt,Surrey,9/10/14,"My ratings

Product quality - distinctly mediocre
Customer service - non-existent
Lying and screwing people over - magnificent"
d marcelli,suffolk,9/10/14,"Having changed over to bt a out 6 weeks ago so I could get the motogp racing I can't fault the internet. However, as a bt customer you should get bt WiFi which for the last 4 weeks and daily phone calls normally an 1 hour + long and they still can't resolve the issue that whenever me or wife are out and our mobiles pick up a bt WiFi spot it will not connect, it refuses all passwords or knowledge that we even have a bt account. Basically they as much use as a chocolate tea point and I'm very close to cancelling the package."
matthew,clacton on sea,9/10/14,so far sins being with bt iv not being billed the right amount to what i saided up for cos with in the fist 4 weaks when we singed up to 8.99 deal we got chareged 33 pound then even sins then its being eny where from 61pound to 140 wich for only being with them sins may is a bit over the top not to menshon the carp customer care you get when you call them to try and find out why the bill is so much so pleas read the reviews first be for going with em becose there nothing but a rip of for what you get and dont stick with the contract you ask for and sing up with
mohsen hamed,Wallington,9/8/14,"Lost phone and broadband infinity for 3 weeks only for BT to finally check the local network box and find our line had been disconnected.

Absolute rubbish.

We had 3 weeks of agony, inconvenience and loss of income as could not use the internet for work at home. No friends or family could contact us.

Go elsewhere.

All calls are handled by India!! one one occasion the customer service lady put the phone down on me.

Leaving BT."
Woodbridge of Suffolk,Woodbridge,9/5/14,"BT needs to be either investigated by PANORAMA or DISPATCHES on a monthly basis, I have forwarded all our complaint to watchdog (BBC)... promised a package and start date, which once we moved turned out to be a joke, spent an hour on the phone with a woman who found English hard who promised to ring back and who of course did not, further calls and the date got even later leaving school children who need the internet due to illness at home with no internet and our business at risk DUE NOT USE BT"
Paillard,Sevenoaks,9/4/14,"If you are in the midst of deciding on your provider, DO NOT USE BT. BT for start is so unreliable, one minute the internet could be working and a reasonable speed then within the hour, it is taking ten minutes to load a youtube video; honestly 3G in my house is sometimes faster!! To try and find positives in BT's customer service is like trying to sugarcoat a turd. WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE?! BT will put you through to some random in India and keep you on hold for UP TO AN HOUR. If, by this time, you are not already annoyed, they will continue to aggravate you by ""not being able to send out an engineer for a week"" even though you were promised one two days ago, because ""your call wasn't logged"". Honestly BT is probably the most god awful server, they make their money through the calling charges you rack up when they place you on hold. So to conclude, DO NOT USE BT."
Callum,"Sealyham, Pembrokeshire",8/29/14,"Our bt wifi has never been very good, however recently it has got worse. I often need to reset the router to get my devices to connect. And when the do it is sometimes slow. I recently sent them an email but got no response, and so I have had to write a bad review. I am sorry it had to come to this, but you left me no choice.
Thanks for your time,
Callum"
steve,United Kingdom,8/29/14,"The most appalling service i have ever experienced from any company. they should be made to pay back money which they rob from there customers.
i have had unusable BB and barely usable phone line on and for for 8 months. 20 or more calls to customer service and no further forward than day 1. they are criminals. will cancel as soon as contract ends and never ever use them again. DO NOT USE BT AT ANY COST"
Phil,Swansea,8/28/14,"I have been with BT for over 10 years and have upgraded to their ""Fibre Optic"" Broadband which isn't really fibre optic. We had a problem with our broadband diconnecting constantly which led us to the fibre optic ""upgrade"" to 40mb speed which is better than our previous 25mb. But back to this, we had several drops in our connection including our Landline being unusable due to poor installation for starters. The customer services ""HELPline"" Help being the word we would believe to be legitimate rescue. Were far from a helpful service being on hold before they answer for going on 16 minutes finally get an answer from a gentleman with a questionable name being ""Lorraine"" for some strange reason. Lorraine then went onto explain that it was clearly my fault although the final conclusion was an installation flaw where the tech that came out failed to finalise our connection on BT's end. But Lorraine the gender confused man was insistent that it was all my fault cheers BT. I now work for virgin media and as soon as my contract is up will be switching over or maybe will just pay for the hub to get out sooner had enough..."
S. Rat,Bucks,8/26/14,"Had to comment about the awful customer service and incompetence of BT, both Phone and Fibre.
First off I must say the product BT Fibre is not an issue, works fine only a few drop outs. But the Customer Service, wow how bad was that. At first we had to deal with India who couldn't understand me or half the billing issues, then when customer service came back to the UK, rather than get better it appears to have got worst. I am in the dying throws of changing from BT after year to PlusNet (who by the way have been great - take note BT). I tried to get BT to simply allow me to change to PlusNet, i.e. get a MAC code etc, oh no was told had to cease my service even after said I would need MAC code etc for PlusNet as would be going with them. No couldn't do that, later in week called again after talking to PlusNet who correctly advised that was wrong etc, was told this time whoever had done order before was wrong and that would sort it and gave me my MAC code (I trusted them -bad move), again when spoke to PlusNet they advised still unable to put order through even with MAC code. Another call to BT different person, then later call back from their person as she was telling me my date for ceasing etc had turned from sometime in sept to 29 august, again told by new manager that they had sorted the cease and set everything correct for PlusNet to do. So next PlusNet tried and got half way - i.e. it let the order start but was not fully confirmed. So checked again why PlusNet having issues today, they couldn't see from their end, so spoke to BT, first guy said and confirmed that Cease was back on after it was supposed to have been stopped and that wouldn't have internet and phone after 29th Aug. Another call to PlusNet and this time, who said explained why no confirmation on their order, so they cancelled and said sorry but you would have to talk to BT to get rid of cease and make into migration, which should be not an issue. Another call to yet another BT person this time somebody who deals with cancellation, who apologised but said in fact that after tonight I would have no Internet and Phone, not after 29th and that because was so close could not stop cease and could not do migration. sorry but that was all he or anyone could do, took a note of the fact that I have paid for my full month of August by Direct Debit and said to reference this when get final bill to get back any money already paid from 27th till end of August.

So through all this I get nothing from BT in terms tracking of my call (unlike PlusNet, where at least you get an email of your query and question), I get told one story after another - I am half expecting that internet is about to die any moment as I a writing this, no real apologises, no really managers who want to know at this late stage of your annoyance - nobody today would let me talk to manager even after they had talked to their manager about issue.

So stay well away from BT - they haven't a clue what is going on, they tell multiple stories and just don't care about their customers.
BTW - never mentioned all the issues about my billing from the start because it would just take ages. I think at this rate the amount of time I have spent trying to sort things out with BT, they should employ me and pay me at least it would then be worthwhile."
Joan Reilly,Livingston,8/26/14,Even giving a one is to much. The service I receive for 8month was 0.6 and this was from the very beginning I had to pay a engineer to inform me it was BT fault from exchange to house even then would not refund for bad service. Csr and managers spend our money to learn to be rude so have left and had to pay £55 for a hub that did not work adviced to send this back and I would be refunded ( you guessed it never happened ) stay away from BT if you have a choice
Lola,Mires,8/24/14,It is very slow and it only works in the room that the box is in and when it came to be installed they said it would work with 3 bats in every room and it only works in one room and also if you have 3 bars it's still slow but if you have 2 bars it dosent even work and that is very bad so please could you make an improvement kind regards and I don't mean to be rude if I am coming across rude I am very sorry
DB,London,8/24/14,
Graham Small,Nottingham,8/21/14,"BT are the worst company I have dealt with for customer service. Many calls are dealt with off shore (and the line isn't very good - irony anyone?). It took over one month to connect my phone line and two months for broadband. The advisors are generally hopeless, lie and fail to get the problem solved. I curently have a broadband fault open. This should have been fixed by now but, having just phoned BT, they have failed to raise the fault correctly (what ever that means).
BT used to be a monopoly and they deal with customers like they still are. I will never be a BT customer again."
Gavin Roberts,Glasgow,8/20/14,
Matt,Devon,8/20/14,I have experienced an ongoing intermittent connection with barely usable internet. Customer service is appalling - the constant hoop-jumping means that a solution is never achieved and the compartmentalisation of departments means that the company functions appallingly. It is shocking that such a manifest breach of contract is shrugged off by such a big player in the telephony market.
Michael,Corwen,8/20/14,"I can hardly find anything positive to say about this service provider as of now.

Firstly let me mention the engineers, they're hardly competent at performing their installations job, we recently moved home and wanted the fastest package possible, sure we have that but at the expense of half-trained engineers. They proceeded to go forward with the installation without any regard for the previous installed line, absolutely no testing was done whatsoever.

We called them on this regard several times, once in a friendly manner explaining the issue. I was informed that they would be running tests and would get back to us shortly, being a patient person I waited 2 days (no call came through), after those 2 days we contacted them again, this time we got through and managed to get information regarding the issue.

We got informed they would be sending an engineer out by Tuesday, sure Tuesday came, no engineer came. We contacted them, yet again, we were informed that no engineers were active that day. Surely common sense tells us that they should've checked the schedule in the first place. Evidently not. (An engineer will be sent out Thursday - So they say). The entirety of this issue could have been avoided if they tested the line in the first place. Just to add even more annoyance they send the bill. I'm adamant on refusing to pay this until I've actually had some service worth paying for.

Had I known that the service provider was this poor in my area I would've avoided them entirely

I will be more inclined on writing a far more friendly and accurate review once I've actually experienced some services.

(Sorry to those of you reading this review - I know it is rather long and detailed)"
darren,glasgow,8/19/14,
Greg,Guildford,8/17/14,I have had to go thro 3 x 45 minute plus telephone calls with customer service all to no effect - On speed test I normally get less than 1 Mbps often less than 0.5 - My plan i.to contact trading standards ii. issue claim in small claims court for refund for broadband charges since start of contract. Plus comp for my time on phone. I would NEVER recommend BT Broadband to anyone. In ratings I would suggest negative ratings because I so resent even giving them 1 x star
Darren,Stockport,8/16/14,"Bloody disgusting we ring up a call centre worker hangs up so we report on facebook. Then next day ring in again and we are told we will be compensated !, then when it's eventually fixed you say you don't count weekends even though we are paying for those days and you don't count the day I reported on facebook and the same day your call centre worker hung up. Then today I explained my mum has been with you decades and will leave the reply was if you decide to that's up to you !!! Great thanks !! So 5 days no phone no internet and no great customer service. Do you want to retain your long time customers ? Who haves been with you many decades? Clearly not then when we contact to explain on facebook they just delete posts. Terrible customer care"
David Alexander,huntly,8/16/14,staff rude and unhelpful.viewbox needs new ariel as will not work with sat dish.was told should have read small print.phone has no caller display or answer phone any more again was told to read small print.kept waiting on phone when trying to explain my problems.what a hassle don't go there
Jagga,Ilford,8/15/14,I would echo most of what people have already said regarding BT. The broadband worked for 2hours and then stopped. The customer service is also terrible. The staff are content trying to defend the poor service and don't listen. I switched to Virgin and I am glad I did. I had to cancel on 3 occasions as the service was still running.
JACKIE GEAR,,8/14/14,"Sick of BT They have given me a lousy £3 refund for doing without Broadband for over a week and nothing previous times when it has gone off. They come up with lots of excuses but never refund properly. So much for customer care. I shall not be usuing them again and I say to everyone who reads this, that they are a rip off, over priced, and provide no service. END OF."
M. Orchard,Devon,8/12/14,Customer Service and ability to deal with problems is a disgrace from their Indian Call Centre It a service given on the cheap and it certainly shows.. Getting anything right is just a bridge too far for them. Monkey's would do better
Derek,Borders,8/12/14,move from sky to BT mistake slow cant connect drop in signal should of stayed with sky now stuck 12 mounths
Sara,Merseyside,8/6/14,"They have the worst speeds for broadband, the connection consistently drops, the BT Box equipment is faulty, constantly freezing, restarting, slow, unresponsive, and Im paying £5 a month for what is essentially freeview, and to get BT Sport for free, I have to renew my contract for another 12 months, NOT A CHANCE. They also overcharged me for months on end, refunded me and then tried to take more unauthorised payments to the extent my bank blocked them no matter what I said because of the amount of refunds to me. Then they tried overcharging me, charging me for a late payment when it was 3 days early, then they kept disconnecting me about once every 1/2 weeks even though I was paying monthly, charging me £25 to reconnect me then charging £2 to pay online even though my bank blocked their direct debits because they kept taking unauthorised transactions out the account and they act strongly on theft and fraud. Apart from the latest advisor Ive spoken to (must be about 80th!)who was appaled at how I'd been treated, each and every other one could barely grasp the english language and were rude and it was a horrible experience everytime. I have never felt so stressed with a company before, just dont risk it!"
Adrian Love,Stuminster Marshall,8/3/14,Speed is simply pathetic. Last month it jumped from Less than 5 mb to over 14mb; that was brilliant now it's back to the same old bt bad service at below 5mb.
Furious,London,8/2/14,
GG,Bow,8/2/14,"Is BT slowing customers' broadband down on purpose to force us to upgrade? After being nagged by phone calls from BT prompting me to upgrade, I turned them down as I do not want to be tied to a 2 year further contract. Coincidentally, their broadband service has got worse in the last week."
Celia,Northampton,7/28/14,"I've had problems but worse is my son's experience. He ordered a BT package for his new house and was promised it a week ago. He stayed in each day but it has not arrived. Every day he rings them and is reassured it will arrive the next day. He now tried to cancel because they are not giving him a service but they say he can't, How come he has to keep his part of the contract while they don't keep theirs? Totally inadequate and when I move soon I will not sign up with BT again."
arc,Staffs,7/25/14,"I have been a BT customer since 1998. Not for much longer. Due to very poor customer service I have decided to take my business elsewhere. The package is overpriced, broadband often unreliable and the included email service is sub standard, unusable majority of the time and the spam filter is useless. They have barriers to their complaints process and refuse to let you speak to a senior manager. In the case of the complaint I raised about the broadband reliability and the poor email service I found that they did not follow their published complaints process. They do not engage in lasting customer relationships and loyalty counts for nothing."
Ed FOOTE,aberdeen,7/25/14,"For 7 weeks now Bt has striped me of i/c and O/g e-mails,cut-off my B/b and have sent scatty with conversations which did'nt appear to be understood,whilst all the time collecting each month money from my a/c.They have lost all emails for the last month or so!
Letters sent to the Chaiman, Ceo, but progress so far NIL.Yesterday he phone rang twice and on answering ther was no one there .Entry in log ""we phoned but nobody was there"" Sharp practice!!!"
Betty,Derby,7/24/14,"I am 82 years young and have just had the most awful experience with bt upgrade to infinity. They gave me connection dates which never were changed 3 times
Then there technical support team asked all kinds of questions which were over my head my son has spoke to them about asking me to take screws out of sockets and plugging things in I have know idea about I could have been seriously injured if I had taken a 240 mains socket of the wall !!! I have now cancelled my set up and will move to a more competent provider."
Stephen Burgess,Ashford Kent,7/22/14,"When BTMail started, I lost all my email addresses on MacMail, I contacted BT on 3 occasions and spoke to BTIndia.on all 3 occasions it ended up after they had read thru their sheets with failure. I have paid my line rental for the year so would lose this if I try to move to another ISP.
I was told it was a problem for Apple which is rubbish and that I should pay £35 and talk to them. Lately I got Sky TV and although I have Infinity it still takes up to 20 minutes to download a one hour programme if you try to do it at 5pm
I am waiting to see what they do next. Maybe it will be someone in the UK!"
rebecca,northern ireland,7/21/14,The worst idea my mother has ever had !! Bt youview box and broadband dnt work half the time the hub turns of every hour or less the demand players dont work andwe have had a tech person out every month since we got it in ! Every time u phone to get it fixed u cant understand the person over the phone and they are ignorant to you ! Bt is a useless ... that I have told everyone how much problems we have had and that I will never be working with again !!!!!!
Bernard,"Fowey,Cornwall",7/21/14,When using the broadband the service drops out frequently even when complaining to them. Then the telephone charges include items I have not asked for.
Bryan Usrey,"Leeds, UK",7/19/14,"The worst customer service of any provider I have ever used. They are flat out liars and will tell you one thing, and then change their minds. A word of advice for any poor soul stuck with this terrible company, get everything they tell you in writing."
Keith,Bristol,7/17/14,"Huge disappointment. Had been convinced by them that not only would the broadband be consistent and speedy but that Infinity would be coming within 3-6 months. Neither has proven true along with no way of getting e-mails from my private domain (which every previous provider managed to do). I should have known better - it is BT after all. Tempted to say more (lots more I could say) but there's little point as no-one will listen, let alone do anything. So - see out the contract and leave BT (again) - this time never to return."
dolly daniel,maryport cumbria,7/17/14,"just before moving house I was persuaded by BT to upgrade to INFINITY.Dreadful experience ending in 30 min call when I was passed from person to person including a rude line manager.Despite cancelling an engineer turned up next day for an apt they said they had cancelled. Would have been funny if not so stressful.Never ever sign up to this bunch of clowns!Unbelievable that they then continued to email,text and ring me weeks later about my order for broadband."
Matt,London,7/16/14,
umayr,United Kingdom,7/15/14,Bt is slow expensive not reliable dont get it you will be ripped of I had to pay 365.59p for cancellation fee f that I normally pay about £45.00-£60.00
keith,notts,7/10/14,wasn't too bad while I was with them but trying to cancel has been a nightmare and they even charge £40 to stop your broadband.I cancelled in may and got a letter saying we are sorry you are leaving yet they recon im still with them and they are trying to charge me up to 26th july and ive been on virgin since 16th june
Owen,Derbyshire,7/10/14,"After endless problems with slow or non existent broadband I considered changing, but due to no chance of having fibre optic in our area in my lifetime I had to sign up with BT again, the only plus side is that I am now only paying half of what it was last year.
The problem is simple but BT will not admit to it, the infrastructure for telephone and broadband in the UK is really old and will cost a fortune to upgrade.
Most homes in the UK had a telephone in the 60s and the same cables and junction boxes are still there.
All emerging country's are on fibre optic as it was the obvious choice but most of this country will still be stuck with copper wiring for a long time.
I am not defending the horrendous customer service of bt that makes every caller feel like a retard but when a previous government thought it was good to have competition they forgot that BT was still expected to maintain and upgrade the exchanges and lines."
Jonathan,Milton Keynes,7/9/14,"Appalling customer service, inconsistencies and weak wireless (homehub5), erratic internet connection, just terrible all round. I cannot wait to leave them at the end of my contract."
Simon,Portsmouth,7/4/14,"Circa £45pm worst customer service received ever! Rude and swearing so tried to speak to a manager ""Nothing I can do"" you have to write a letter which they do not reply to! Took £50 of calls to cancel the broadband and phone which was already disconnected wasn't to bad only cost me a further £45 plus £50 disconnection fee so £145 and a week of stress on the phone. Never again will I ever use a product and will warn anyone reading this BEWARE BT!!!!"
Ward,"Takeley, Bishops Stortford",7/3/14,"complained to BT stating slow broadband speed. They sent an engineer who decided best way to improve speed was to disconnect bedroom phone line. He did this and left telling me he had also contacted the office and they would boost the power. I am now without bedroom phone,£125 lighter for his services and still rubbish download speed and dodgy hub that you have to turn on and off twice before the blue lights come on."
Ade,Stuminster Marshall,7/2/14,Finally our speed is around 15mb from 7mb. which is excellent for our area
Jarcca,Surrey,7/1/14,I have ordered the BT Infinity 2 package. The BT engineer did not turn up and their customer service person was really rude with his 'Im sorry but this is not our fault' and I can wait another 2 weeks+ for the engineer - and even than he cannot guarantee that they will show up...That is the best he can do! Real time waster and cannot believe that this sort of trading is allowed. They hold me as a hostage now as Im still within a contract with my phone line and it is quite expensive to break the contract (£96 I think they said). Nice one BT! I could rant forever but hey ho - lets move on and take my customs somewhere else and leave as many negative reviews all over the internet instead :) I cannot comment on the actual speed and reliability of service (for obvious reasons) so gave them an estimated 1 star (expected average :)
Ourmoi,Gloucestershire,6/28/14,
Ianr,Cardiff,6/26/14,"I moved from Virgin to BT about 4 years ago, everything was fine then I upgrade to infinity and my problems started ok I live very near to exchange so when my Broadband works I get 55 - 60 mb download speeds but it never stays consistent it continually drops off, consistent complaining to BT found it was my BT Vision box as it is hard wired when it downloads or updates it stops the Wifi signal hence drop off on ipad .. Apple TV .. Laptop etc !! If you can ask them to upgrade to the newer youview box (don't pay for it) also check what else you have plugged into your hub it may also be affecting when updating .. So not all bad but service is still shocking ... And probably I will be back on the phone to BT soon when the you view box starts to develop faults !!!"
Lynton Susman,Manchester,6/23/14,"My following comments are not really about the reliability or the quality of BT's products, but more so to do with what happens when something goes wrong, for example, when suddenly none of your phones work and your broadband works intermittently. The ""offshore"" service, on this occasion, were absolutely useless. The young lady, from somewhere in India, whilst irritatingly polite, (mentioning my surname a minimum of five times in one sentence), never seemed to offer and straight answers to any of my questions and yet,skilfully skirted around them, with well rehearsed ""scare tactics,"" suggesting that I would be charged £120, should the engineer discover that it's not BT's fault. Never got any satisfaction after a full hour's frustration and aggravation. Eventually, having ""had enough,"" I insisted on being put through to a UK based technical team who talked me through a few checks. Eventually I discovered and corrected, (by process of elimination and from my own skills set),the fault itself. It was a failed ADSL filter, which costed me £1.99 from the local ""sells everything"" shop. Come on BT, you gotta try harder. If you have to use offshore call centres, then, for goodness sakes, train them properly !"
Tim C,Isle of Wight,6/17/14,"When you compare notes, the BT con-artists use similar tricks; they blame: the socket, the ADSL filter, the telephone, your device, indeed everything possible to avoid fixing their own sub standard, poorly maintained equipment. 50 minutes yesterday spent convincing some Indian bloke that the line was faulty, and I would guess that his diagnostic tool could have indicated that within seconds. Download speed (!) of 0.13 mbps, when we expect to receive 6mbps, and are supposedly supplied with 12 mbps. Now the phone line is very crackly again, and the B T 0.5 wit attempts to persuade me that that my phone is to blame, and offers a new filter. I install a replacement filter; no improvement. The phone line runs along an untrimmed hedge, and is about thirty years old. Two years ago they replaced a short length...."
Anti BT,Huntingdon,6/17/14,
Jonathan,United Kingdom,6/16/14,"We've had telephone lines and broadband installed at work. BT are appalling to deal with. The first engineer, a gentleman with a Chinese appearance was very good, staying late into the evening to get lines connected but we needed another line installed into the building which he was not trained to do,. Along comes another engineer who looked at what was needed, decided in 2 minutes he could not do it, walled off and told his boss he was unable to get access to our office suit-a complete lie, the next didn't even knock on the office door, he just said he could not get access. Then we were to have 3 lines going to one phone number but at present 1 line goes to that number so if we are on the phone no one can call us. The salesman now doesn't answer emails or call. So here we are 2 months on still without the correct work and without anyone having a care about it. Any suggestions on how we get BT to do the job they said they could so?"
Dnomyar,Devon,6/13/14,"What is wrong with BT Broadband Customer Care?

More appropriately, BT Customer Care ought to be called the BT Customer Barrier. Its primary function is to defend BT from the problems its customers may be having and its fundamental ethos is that the customer is always wrong. They are the masters of the Dismissive Fob-Off.

This is made abundantly clear at the point of initial contact, its internet pages, where the first thing to greet you is the statement that most faults occur within the customer’s own infrastructure. This bizarre assumption is carried right through the extensive faults procedure where each step is directed remorselessly toward persuading the customer to find and fix a fault that without further investigation is undoubtedly on their own premises and of their own making; BT does not admit that faults might occur outside of customer premises or make provision for those who are competent enough to have already carried out these basic checks and want to move on. Neither is there a clear onward step for BT to take ownership of a reported fault after the checking procedure has been completed – again there is an assumption that all faults are the responsibility of the customer. For a persistent customer it leaves the complaints procedure as the only option to progress.

The complaints procedure is another mechanism dominated by the customer-is-always-wrong ethos. The first thing a customer service operator will do is to insist a customer go through the same step by step procedure covered by its internet pages, regardless of whether or not the customer has already done this. Presumably the operator is trained to believe that the customer is incompetent. There is a pre-scripted, condescending and belittling conversation that follows which often involves the customer service operator magically changing from a care representative into a sales representative, offering new packages and various pieces of equipment that he is almost sure will cure the fault. The last resort, if a customer manages to stand firm and turn down all these alluring offers, is for the operator to reassure the customer that everything will be all right if they just be patient and give it a couple of weeks. Then it’s goodbye.

During the lifetime of a fault this procedure will repeat itself several times and each time the customer service operator will behave as if it were the first. BT appears to have no method of gathering useful retrievable information about a specific complaint or sharing it between operators. Eventually frustration and anger from a customer will lead to elevation where the customer is promised a call-back from a BT engineer. Call-backs from BT engineers are not lightly won.

If you are lucky to be promised a call-back you will be given a time slot and an automatic telephoned reminder first thing in the morning while you are still in bed. A pre-recorded voice message from a hugely condescending and suspiciously sceptic female will make sure you are awake and ready for your call, which may not be for several hours. If you are very lucky your call-back will be made, but often they are delayed or forgotten or have not been booked at all. And, of course, it will be your fault.

I know all this because I have been through it on more than one occasion. My latest battering against the BT Customer Barrier began four or five weeks ago after I had meticulously carried out my own checks. For some months I had noticed that BT broadband was either dropping out completely or reducing strength to download speeds that were unusable, sometimes as low as 0.01mbps, but mostly between 1 and 2. This always seemed to coincide with peak times when my BT contract assured me my signal would not fall below 5 or 6. My own checks consisted first of looking closely at my wifi which at the time admittedly was quite weak. I installed a wifi repeater which boosted the signal but did not resolve the problem so I changed my phone filters but this did not resolve the problem either. I tested the line using quiet mode but there was no noise on the line, I changed my router, I repositioned my router, I changed to Ethernet and used only the BT service socket cutting out all intermediate infrastructure in my home, and I tried all of the above whilst turning on and off various devices I thought might affect my broadband signal. Nothing solved the problem.

At this point I fully believed I had covered every possible self-check known to man, but BT felt differently and tried to make me go through them all again. BT then told me it was my router, which I knew it wasn’t, and that I would have to buy a new one, which I already had, so I declined; then they told me that most probably there was work going on in the area that I did not know about, but neither did the operator because when I asked him about it he admitted he did not know if there was work going on in the area or not. I actually admire him for making that bit up; it showed a spark of spirit. Eventually he told me everything would be all right if I was patient and to wait a couple of weeks, and then he said goodbye.

Everything was not all right and after two more weeks, two more emails and two more conversations that had to begin from scratch because BT had forgotten everything I’d said previously, I eventually won my call-back from a BT engineer and an agreed time slot. Only it didn’t happen. I waited for the call but it never came. A call did come, nearly an hour after the allotted time slot, but I was not there having already given up waiting for it. And of course, that was my fault again.

So, what is wrong with BT Customer Care? Well, just about everything to be honest. It is fundamentally flawed from top to bottom. It has a preconceived conviction that the customer is always wrong and does nothing to hide that conviction. From a customer perspective it is like trying to swim up a waterfall. They make you feel so small. BT Customer Care needs dismantling and rebuilding from scratch, it is an appalling, abhorrent and arrogant organisation that ought to be banned from having the name British in its title; I am pro-European and British, and I am ashamed that BT Customer Care can use the same designation, which is less confrontational than it sounds given that it is mostly located in India. It has become the benchmark by which all poor customer service in Britain is measured by, a level of incompetence to avoid. It’s no coincidence that other internet service providers make a major selling point of not having the same customer service setup as BT.
Eventually my call-back came after weeks of trying and BT agreed to monitor my broadband speed to see themselves what was happening – an appropriate course of action I suggested at the outset. No apology because, naturally, I had been wrong to suggest it and it had only become the correct thing to do when they thought of it. They agreed to monitor my broadband speed and to call me back after three days. After only one day I received an email saying that I should monitor my own speed and send them the results. I pointed out that I had already done so, several weeks earlier. I sent them new results. In all the speed test results sent to BT a clear pattern of drop-out and poor signal strength at regular times during the day were obvious. BT then took to calling me back at times when they knew my signal would not be dropping and asking me to run a speed test, thereby proving I was wrong about having a fault on my line.

Fault or no fault, BT Broadband remains unusable for around two hours per day. When this current contract ends I shall be looking for a new provider."
Rich,Milton Keynes,6/12/14,"DO NOT USE THIS RUBBISH COMPANY!

Internet speed in evening is so slow. Try to call them to sort it loads if times, always rude, always trying to pretend its due to the wireless connection. Their staff are basically blagging it. If it was wireless it would be all the time. It's clearly some form of throttling.

Bottom line is they just say the speed is fine and are only willing to send an engineer out during the day when the problem isn't then.

They are basically getting £30 a month for nothing as I only really want the internet in the evening. Speeds are often 0.3mbs in evening.

Avoid like the plague. I certainly will even be a customer of theirs again. As I wilL have to pay some hefty price to get out of them and get sky back in. As they have point blank refused to cancel the contract."
Mr Bee,E Sussex,6/11/14,"I must have been really lucky here, I have had FibreOp on Infinity 2 from BT for almost 18 months now, I had a shaky start getting the order right and getting the engineer here, and experienced a few router reboot in the beginning but once I realised I needed to get shot of the crappy HH3 they supplied and put a decent router on I've never looked back.

Bandwidth has been consistently high, and I have between 4 and 15 devices connected at any one time, uptime is pretty good too, I think I've only been offline 2-3 times in that last 18 months and for 5 minutes at most.

The reason for being offline and the only really annoying thing I have encountered with the connection is that I often work at night and the router reboot itself sometimes, after what looks like an attempted router update or some re-syncing going on. Other than this it has been good as gold and I have to say that around 8-9 of my friends and family are on it too and none of them have had any major problems to report.

The one thing I have experienced however, is the shocking customer service, the fact that everything needs explaining in triplicate and that no-one seems to understand your point and that they are often keen to pass you over to the next person. I find this is the case with quite a few companies who farm out their telephone support though.

Overall I am generally happy with the service and considering the number of folks experiencing troubles, I am feeling lucky that I have not had to spend too much time talking with India."
A Rhodes,North Yorkshire,6/9/14,"Our BT broadband experience has been terrible, we've a problem with parental controls meaning we can't even get facebook. The help dept promise help but never deliver, we've had several promises of calls to help none of which materialise. This is our worst ever broadband customer experience - avoid BT! I've given a 1 star review because the zero option wasn't available!"
Ken,Glasgow,6/8/14,Problems occur with every company but in my experience BT resolve them effectively...I love the new Infinity and the TV from BT which - if you compare it to some alternatives is great value for moeny. Ignore the moaning minnies
Nick Riggall,Surrey,6/7/14,"While the BTinfinity product is good, I've had terrible customer service issues during a house move. Broken promises, failed calls to arrange engineer visits and nearly 2 weeks without any service whatsoever. And then a wonderful bill comes through the door. Call centre calls don't have the info, they claim they've tried to contact me. Lies and really bloody rude.

Speed and reliability based on my previous address."
Suzanne,Southern England,6/3/14,"We've been with BT phone and broadband for two years. Our package is 10GB broadband and anytime calls. Most of the time, everything has worked fine. Our contract is soon due for renewal, so we've tried to haggle a new deal from BT. We're currently paying £33 a month. They could offer nothing better, even though we quoted what other providers could offer. Having read the dreadful reviews about other providers, we have no idea who to go with now. So many folk seem to have problems."
Helena,London,6/2/14,"Can I give minus stars? Because that is what the service deserves. It's terrible. I am studying for an exam and at least 4 or 5 times a day I can't watch my online seminars because the connection or speed has a problem.

Worst broadband ever."
Chris,SE London,6/1/14,"Worst company ever. Avoid at all costs, I switched and am without internet access for 10 dats now because if their incompetence and total lack of customer service and care. I have never encountered such terrible service before and I have lived in seven countries over four continents. Never consider BT, it's a total disaster with lying personnel. I wish I never came across thus rubbish company"
Mat Pershing,London,5/31/14,"I ordered BT Business Broadband in order to ensure a fast reliable serive and a fixed IP address on 21 May 2014. Emails and letters followed with all sorts of login names and passwords to confirm my order, and to tell me that I'll be connected by 29 May 2014, and that I'll get my router the day before. I therefore cancelled my Sky broadband, effictive end of May 2014. Today, on 30 May, I still had not received my promised router and broadband service. I called BT to find out that the Business broadband order line is only open Mon-Fri until 18:00! After several calls and being passed around someone eventually manages to tell me that my order ""has been cancelled"". They didn't know why, didn't know who had cancelled it, and didn't know why I hadn't been told. Therefore I will be left without a broadband or indeed internet service in about a day's time. No-one in BT has bothered to email me, call me, or send me a letter about this mysterious cancellation. Is this why they are ""Britain's favourite broadband""?! This is extremely poor and uncaring service from a company that does not care about its clients as individuals."
damien,doncaster,5/26/14,"that guy who says 'bt offer no cooling off period' yes you do, upon activation you can cancel. what company will let you have the service as a trial then cancel after...haha stupid and bt didnt explain full terms over the phone...grab a chair mate its like a book. they are advisers not story tellers."
Lauren,Lancashire,5/24/14,"I really would not advise bt to anyone, the customer service is awful. They ignore you when you tell then you want to cancel your broadband, then have the cheek to ignore letters and do nothing about it. They still keep sending me bills because they are too lazy to cancel. Worst service i have ever received."
James S,Manchester,5/23/14,TV crashes alot and is slow to respond to the remote control. My broadband is not working and I have have been told that an engineer will come out in 12days time...12 days without broadband that I need for work/business terrible service. And if they decide its was my fault in anyway they will charge me £129 for the call out..
Paulo Moraes,Milton Keynes,5/22/14,Worst service ever never sign with bt ... Is the slowest speed ever customer service very bad ... I do not recomended bt to no one ... I have been getting 0.3 download speed for ages phone to complaint and after 10 calls they decided to send me a enginer and then charge me £130 without sort the problem out ... Is ridiculous never again

Rob Wolf,Seaham,5/16/14,"THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I installed a new line with Infinity Unlimited Weekend calls and calls abroad. It took them nearly 2 months to turn up and install my landline. They charged me nearly £200 in installation, activation fees and first month of rental and sent me a letter that my service is up and running. When I started calling abroad they sent me a bill for another £200 for international calls. I contacted them stating that it should be free of charge but they said that the service had not been activated and it takes up to 5 weeks to get it active, in the meantime I had to pay standard tariff. My brodband speed should have been close to 30Mb but it reached max of 0.9Mb. They blamed line filters, their engineer came and replaced them charging me another £43.80. The speed remained the same, when I phoned them they told me that I probably have a virus (I have Mac) and tried me to sell antivirus for windows, also to install newest updates from Microsoft although it is Apple. At the end I just resigned being charged another £86 for eraly exiting fees and installed a new VirginMedia line. I WILL NEVER EVER GET ANYTHING FROM BT"
Gary W,Gloucestershire,5/16/14,"BT's customer service via its overseas call centre is truly atrocious.
They are completely lacking in empathy or understanding when there is a problem.
That could be partially offset if they could do their job, but they can't diagnose - never mind solve issues.
Worse still their complaint handling at the overseas call centre is laughable.
Not only do they fail to phone back - on the day or time they themselves set - but when they do eventually contact you expect to be merely quoted unhelpful and generic drivel along the lines of ""our BT standards say....""
BT stance - via these call centres - even where there is clear evidence of financial loss due directly to their failures, is to weasel out of any responsibility.
The new BT slogan should be ""BT broadband - with added choice"" ...you pay BT and when its service goes down you get to choose and pay for cellular broadband whilst BT try and sort out their own mess."
AW,Gloucestershire,5/15/14,"Living in a rural location means I can accept slow speed. However, BT's customer service (from their non-UK) call centre - when something goes wrong - is atrocious.
They are unable to diagnose, never mind resolve, issues.
Furthermore, they don't phone back when they've arranged to and refuse to even consider compensation - even where there is documentary evidence of financial loss.
They're abusing historic goodwill and relying on customer apathy."
Jon,Isle of Wight,5/15/14,"The product is fine from BT no technical problems over the 12 months, however their sales team and customer service team communications and billing systems are the worst I have ever came across.

I bought a bolton package when I signed up with BT that 12 months later they tried to re sell me the same one and advised I never had the package, there over complex time consuming billing system for BT phone calls and separate bills for Broadband is a joke, no simplicity the sales agents need to attain at least should be recruited with some listening skills, one costly problem led onto another, leave BT go with premier calls I halved my bills over night, BT are an expensive, overpriced"
Peter G,Flintshire,5/13/14,"All I want is to receive a basic service and pay the correct amount each month. I have never had an issue with other companies, but BT can't seem to handle it without messing up. I have never, ever been billed correctly.

Getting any sort of assistance is near impossible. After spending half an hour navigating their menu systems and even longer being passed between various departments, you might be lucky to speak to somebody in the right team.

Unfortunately, the staff in their call centres, whether based in the UK or overseas, are the rudest and most obnoxious people that you could ever experience. When an issue gets difficult to resolve, they simply hang up and pretend that the call dropped.

Their complaints team aren't any better either. You are lucky if they offer a meaningless apology. They can't offer any recompense for the time, cost, inconvenience or vexation of having to spend hours and hours on the telephone resolving their mistake. They'll make promises and then retract them within a few hours. Several of the advisors in their Executive Level Complaints team feel that it's appropriate to scream and shout down the phone and then hang up.

As they are such a large corporation, they seem to think they are above the law and don't have to abide with Ofcom's regulations. I have now referred two complaints to the Ombudsman, at BT's expense, and luckily I am in the process of moving suppliers.

Gavin Patterson, you should hang your head in shame. Your company has fundamental issues and it seems to be getting worse.

Never again."
Fabio,london,5/13/14,"BT service is the worst ever experiences in my life. They messed up the order twice,i had to make several calls, and when you ask to talk with the managers the line drops... they took me money and they refund me back weeks later. They makes a lot of problems and mistakes and the foult is always of the customer. Broadband speed is not as expected and the service is always failing. I have to contact them at least twice a month to check. I will now move to sky they told me is much more reliable and customer service is able to manage queries."
Charlotte,Bath,5/12/14,"I have always had my home internet services from BT and it's safe to say they have been unreliable at best.
I have never had any issues with customer service but actual broadband speeds are absolutely atrocious. The highest speeds I have ever received are 3mb/s and that is on an extremely good day.

Speeds are inconsistent and sluggish and something I have noticed happening regularly is the sudden dropout of all internet access at all times of day.

If you're interested in gaming then this is definitely not for you. LAG is the only word to describe it.

If you have access to BT Infinity then I'd maybe suggest going for that if you're still interested in choosing BT. But, if you live in the same area as me I would advise you avoid BT.

A quick note on landline prices. BT phone bills that come quarterly and don't include unlimited calls can become extortionate. The amount's my mother has had to pay are absolutely ridiculous and I have finally changed our provider so hopefully things will vastly improve."
Soly,London,5/11/14,Worst company to deal with ever. DO NOT TOUCH THEM!!! EE are much cheaper and more reliable and better customer service. BT has the WORST customer and saw online that they won the ''worst'' award of the year! Keep away!!!!
Andreea,United Kingdom,5/10/14,"I would love to be able to comment on the speeds but nearly 4 months later I still don't have Bt Infinity... due to all the 'terrible weather' of late there has been many delays on pole work is all I seem to hear at the moment.There's delays and then there's outright neglect....4 months??? What other company could get away with this... oh and not a single mention of compensation for any of this, seems like they don't want to take any responsibility....Very fed up."
chris,berrow burnham on sea,5/9/14,"totally disgusted with BT. I am a new customer so you would have thought they would have got it right first time. 3 weeks and lots and lots of phone calls later to INDIA the problems are still not resolved. They lie, they put you off, they do not do what they say they will do, they charge you for a service that you do not get. Now in the realms of Taking BT for breach of contract. DO NOT USE THEM. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED AND I HOP MANAGEMENT OF BT SEE THIS"
Simon,London,5/7/14,"Total money grabbing con-artists. When you sign up, they tell you everything is great over the phone, but they do not make you aware that there is literally NO 'cooling off period' after receiving the full terms. This means that if you agree to the sparse terms they explain over the phone, hang up and then disagree with the full terms & conditions which you can only read once they email them to you, you're stuffed. They also do not make you aware that the cancellation fees constitute HALF the line rental which is over SIXTY POUNDS and you have no choice but to pay it because they've tied you into something you didn't know the full terms & conditions for. I will be avoiding them like they have rabies from now on and I suggest you do the same."
Claire M,Hertfordshire,5/5/14,"Since upgrading to Infinity with Hub 5, my consistent historic data usage has jumped from just under 10GB per month to over 20GB. Have rung and complained so many times that their usage monitor (which my billing is based on) is inaccurate.

Technical Department advised me to download thinkbroadband monitor to my desktop and guess what? It proves my usage is no where near what BT are stating!

Now am locked in this on-going battle to be heard. Their excuse is that my home hub is faulty and that the wireless can be picked up outside the home due to security issues?

Checked all round my house - am on the WPA2 Personal and it is secure (with padlock symbol showing).

Technical Department asked me to change wireless key - did this - usage still escalating?

Technical Department sending a replacement hub? Not sure how that is going to affect the usage monitor which is clearly inaccurate.

BT are thieves - they are stealing from me as in the 2 months since upgrading they have said I have gone over my 20GB allowance. Strange as last month I was away for over 2 weeks and there was no usage whatsoever?!

Now at the stage where I will have to write to OFCOM and considering going public with this.

How can they get away with this?"
Harold,Bournemouth,5/4/14,"BT call centre and support line in Bangalore is a joke, had to ring them to sort out a problem with my 90 year old father's switch to BT mail. They don't understand you and you can hardly understand them, my father would have had no chance! After 2 hours on the phone I was ready to sob with frustration at the constant repetition and lack of understanding. In the end they gave up and so did I . I found the answer to a fairly simple problem by searching Internet forums. This call centre is a disgrace avoid BT like the plague."
Milly,"Camberley, Surrey",5/1/14,"Been with BTyahoo mail for years and no problems.
Change to ne BT Mail is terrible.
System is slow , features only work occasionally, cant format emails easily or properly.
And then - you try and contact anyone at BT for help - they are totally useless.
If you want a package to send business emails on with some decent prompt back-up - DONT CHOSE BT"
chris,west sussex,4/30/14,"I have had problems with going over my limit on broadband, which is confusing as i am on unlimited as by bill clearly states, i have spoken to many people at BT which is hard when you do not get a english speaking person and those who try to speak english are awful to deal with, i have never been able to view a bill online due to a cock up made by BT when setting up my account and also have had my direct debit payment changed without any notification or warning via post or email to let me the CUSTOMER know. My recent dealing with BT was to set up a new deal and should ony be paying £45 a month but the last 3 bills are £73 £83 £96 . I only use the web for emails and searching the net. BT cannot give anyone a breakdown on there broadband other than you have gone over, no dates or times or even what you have been doing e.g. downloading, streaming. BT are by far the worst company of all time and as soon as my contract is near the end i will be going elsewhere. I think this will end up like the PPI where people were being ripped of and someone will eventually blow the whistle on BT and there practices. I turned my pc of and broadband at the router and have not used it for 3 weeks and guess what i still went over my limit, this just proves they are lying thieving scum."
Michael Maycock,"Bempton, East Yorkshire",4/28/14,"I've been a BT customer for longer than I care to remember & have always had issues of one thing or another every year which take forever to get resolved. Most are concerning the ""deals"" they give me. They treat any loyal customer like something they wouldn't tread in, except if they think you're going to leave. WELL I AM THIS TIME! I understand the issues with my broadband speeds, I live in a rural location 4 miles from the exchange, but it doesn't excuse their attitude. I was going to say incompetence but actually they're very good at promising & not delivering whilst continually overcharging. My latest issue concerns my broadband deal which was due to run out in January but as I signed up for BT Sport their email said any broadband deal I was currently ""enjoying"" would be extended to the DNS of my years sport contract. Guess what, they started charging my an extra £5.70 a month so every month I had to call Calcutta to be assured a refund would be made & the overcharge wouldn't happen again. I got a refund of £3.86????? For some reason & the overcharge continues each month & I have to call again. I got a call today from someone over here to tell me the broadband deal didn't last till June when my sport contract ends & there was never such an extension to current deals! Imagine his shock when I offered to forward the original email as I still had it! Yet he still rabbited on about maybe I could ring their customer options number where someone could sort me out another deal. Total bunch of vvankers!"
Chris,Gateshead,4/27/14,"Changed over from Sky on 17th April. We have been watching BBC,ITV etc through the Sky box as we don`t as yet have an aeriel. Tuned in to watch football on Saturday 26th and found we had no channels. Only technical advice I got was that I need an aeriel for updates to be installed. After 54 minutes on the phone and explaining that the channels I wanted to view came through broadband and not the aerial, I was told I needed an aerial for the updates. So after 1 week I now have no tv channels. I am told that a manager will contact me in the next 5 days to try and resolve after I said I was cancelling and going back to Sky. Think very long and hard before changing to BT. If you threaten to leave them you speak to someone in this country. For so called technical advice you speak to someone thousnds of miles away. I spoke to 5 different people in 54 minutes."
SimonF1,Horsham,4/25/14,"I'm currently with BT and have nothing but problems with them, I'm on a upto 16mb unlimited anytime calls package even tho my line is only rated upto 8mb and for the last 3 months im only receiving 1mb at peak times so I complained to them that in itself was a horrible experience, I was told im on a congested exchange and they would see if anything can be done, nothing has been done and since Wednesday morning this week I've had no broadband at all from them, so I spoke with a BT mod and he said he cant do anything until 9th may when a new update will take place, so I said I want to cancel my account then and he flatly refused to agree to it so im kind of stuck now and find it unbelievable that this can happen with-in the British law system.

I understand that every area and exchange will differ in its output, but BT have spread themselves very thin and as a result there is a massive number of congested exchanges, so at peak times 6pm - 11pm and all weekends you will be in the slow lane.

They are not easy to contact and once you do get through to someone you can understand they are bordering on being rude and sarcastic.

If you try and be herd via their forums then forget it as they have that base covered also,
They move your post around in their forums to suit themselves and to hide your complaints with-in a web of old post.

They also use India call centres that will send you mad if you ever do have to phone them.

The worse thing I ever did was to let this cowboy company be my isp. all they provided me with was a headache and frustration."
John,East Anglia,4/24/14,"I have been looking to change from BT to another provider as BT charges are very high, but after reading other reviews on other providers I will stay with BT. Never lost a connection, speed is very fast and found the customer service Dpt. (in India) very helpful, yes they did take the trouble to phone me back to see if all was O.K."
Clare Brown,Nottinghamshire,4/23/14,"Absolutely appalling. Our speeds at best are 2mb - apparently. The reality is more like 1mb and add to this the fact that it is so unreliable. Much of the time the connection is so slow that it times out when trying to browse the web, at other time the signal drops completely and we get the ""No internet connection"" message. Multiple calls to BT on result in being made to go through the exact same scenarios of restarting the router, unplugging cables, etc etc. This in itself is irritating but when you reach the end of it and they say ""well there is nothing wrong"" it gets even more irritating. On three occasions we have had people try to connect to us remotely and found that they couldn't and yet STILL say there isn't an issue. On every occasion we use out BT landline for a call they have to phone back to the mobile because the quality is so bad that they can't hear us, and yet, STILL say there is no issue! We have asked times for an engineer only to be either flatly refused or told it will cost us £150. To cap it all off, each and every call you make, even if it is within the same hour, you have to start from the beginning with the process of going through their check list. I have suggested to people to read our notes before to see that this is a redundant request but they have flatly refused saying that they do not have time to read the previous notes! Then what is the point? really? I despair. Use BT at your peril."
KLHH,London,4/15/14,"I placed an order for BT phone and infinity as I decided to move back to them from Sky. I was told everything would be up and running on 14th April.

My phone has transferred over but nobody had the courtesy to tell me that there was a problem with the Infinity. I used their contact form to contact them with my order reference etc and got a reply saying it would take 10 days to reply to me. They then sent an actual reply saying I had to call another team as the digital team don't deal with orders. Why ask me to fill out a contact form then?

I phoned them and they say that the engineers can't fix the fault at the exchange until Friday as they don't have the part they need. BT don't have a spare part for their own exchange?? So the rest of the week without internet and they say that they cannot do it any sooner than Good Friday. I wonder if they actually will sort it out on a Bank Holiday. I'm furious with the lack of information on their order tracking system. If it says ""delayed"" then at least explain why, without having to call and wait on hold.

If your phone and internet works then do NOT move to BT. They are absolute jokers - and not the funny kind. I wish I had just stayed with Sky. BT are a total waste of time."
Steven C,Exeter,4/11/14,"It was all great for about 3 1/2 years, and then we began to have problems. I believe this was in no small part to your ""upgrade"" of the BT Vision service. What a disaster! As well as BT Vision service developing problems, our Broadband service began to drop out frequently. Having requested a new BT Home Hub for weeks (as it was clear we have a Broadband problem for months) a nice sensible lady, Bandita, has at last agreed that we must have faulty a Home Hub (Version 2.0 from 2010), and is sending me a new one. Too late dear BT, I have signed with Sky having complained to you on numerous occasions about the Broadband service AND the BT Vision service, to no avail. Whilst BT, last week, upheld a complaint about the wrong advice I was given by BT over the telephone (BT complaints having listened to a record of a conversation I had with one of their ""advisors""), BT refuse to make any offer of compensation. Well, dear BT, I guarantee you are going to either spend a great deal of time, and/or pay me at least £60, as I'm taking my complaint to your regulator. BT have failed to provide the service that I have paid for, and have failed to train their team of advisors sufficiently to deal effectively with issues from customers. I have spent many hours in total on the telephone to BT, politely trying to get you to do something. I would much rather have spent my time doing something more productive. BT - you should be ashamed of yourselves!! I'm glad to leaving you."
Elaine Read,Devon,4/8/14,BT Infinity installed Dec 2013 & there is never a week that goes by we're we have no Broadband & to top it all for the last 2 days hourly breaks were the broadband has failed to work...BT then say we have to pay for an engineer to come out and check the sockets etc....What a joke ... Customer Services leave a lot to be desired!!! Now thinking of leaving BT.....
Alex,Essex,4/7/14,"BT is the worst service I have ever used. Over the past 3 months we've been getting broadband speeds of a maximum of 10mbps and a minimum of 0.01mbps - both of which will occur in 5 minutes of each other. After spending many hours on the phone and going through the same useless and redundant 'restart the hub' process we finally got an engineer sent to us - who assured us there were ""no problems"" and was gone in 5 minutes. Their customer service is appalling with a woman even hanging up on us whilst we were mid-discussion - not to mention the people we couldn't understand as they're all based overseas. I would rather pay double the price we're currently paying and go with someone else rather than BT but as they're unwilling to cancel the contract we have with them it looks like we're going to suffer till next year.
My family and extended family have all been told of the issues we've been having and i can assure you that BT have lost customers for life because of it."
Sarah F,York,4/6/14,
Hate BT,bridlington,4/4/14,Thought i would put this here so nobody gets BT it is horribly slow
jonathan,london,4/3/14,"Worst service ever and very deceitful....was told I could access my service anywhere in the world via their links to FON etc internationally. Having traveled to USA, Africa, Middle East and Europe I have never once been able to receive the service... I still have to rely on my 3G with Iphone which is very expensive....complete con...!!! Don't sign up with them..! I wont be renewing my contract.....ever again..! this brand is damaged beyond repair and will take several generations to regain consumer trust."
Sarah,Keighley,4/3/14,"Fail to understand how a company this remote from it's customers, and expensive still exists. May as well be Bangalore Telecom, and why is it only when We've had enough and leave are they suddenly interested and the ability to deal with someone feigning empathy and caring comes in to the equation. Never again. Too expensive and too lacking in caring and customer service. Now we have left, somehow they say we have placed an order for 12 months telephone contrct, which we certainly did not. The explanation behind this when we contacted them made no sense and i'd question the legality, never mind the morality behind it. Never again, even leaving them is like getting rid of a bad smell that hangs around"
Shareen,Keighley,4/3/14,"Incredibly rude and unhelpful customer service, extra charges for services I was told would be free. Cannot express how much you would be better off with any other company. I joined them because i wanted broadband for my children s school work i also got land-line, they joined me with no problem but after the first month they got the bill and when they'd received the bill they suspended my broadband and land-line for 2 weeks, caused me so much trouble, id advised any one with children to never join BT because its a completely terrible service!"
Dorking,Dorking,3/31/14,
Lawrence,Midlands,3/25/14,Customer service is abysmal. They signed me up for packages that I did not request THREE SEPARATE TIMES in twelve months. Contacting them is a nightmare so I presume they think most people will give up and accept the unasked-for charges. Their support staff seem to not care one jot. A deceitful firm in my experience.
Lindsey Robins,Ilford Essex,3/25/14,"Dont bother with infinity, the service is awful, the line drops all the time. In 6 months I have called the tech team over 30 times, had more than 10 engineers who fix the so called problem and 48 hours later the same problems occur. Slow wifi, dropped connection or no connection. Customer service is non existent, impossible to end contract even when service is no good. Please, i beg you, go with Virgin"
Anonymous,London,3/25/14,"Absolutely useless and unprofessional company.

I was moving into a property and needed broadband working as soon as possible due to work requirements, so I called over two weeks in advance to make sure everything would be set up in time.

Received a call from a bored sounding women two days AFTER the date I'd been assured to tell me the service would be ready in another ten days. When I tried to complain I got cut off.

Called back, got through to a bloke who obviously did not care in the slightest, and was informed my service was delayed because the previous tenant told them they couldn't stop the service yet. Why the previous tenant had a say on my service I still do not know.

Asked for broadband to be turned on the same day as the phone line, was told it's not possible. I work in networking, it's definitely possible and only takes a couple of minutes to do.

Said I would like to cancel my order due to the poor service and received a happy ""ok"". No apology for bad service, no compromise on delivery times to get me to stay, nothing.

Shockingly bad customer service from start to finish, false information provided, no form of reparation or compromise offered, all-round unpleasant to deal with."
Racol4k,Devon,3/17/14,"Would like to comment on reliability and speed but have been waiting over 6 weeks for them to even get a phone line connected. Hope their broadband is quicker than their engineers. Getting through to customer services is a nightmare, kept on hold for ages before being answered, obviously on my mobile phone. Rubbish service!"
M. J. Willis,Ashton Hayes,3/13/14,Beware of BT. I live on my own and I have had no phone now for over two weeks. They text you with an appointment and then they do not turn up. The staff do not tell the truth to customers. My health has been affected by the way they have dealt with me. Sadly I have lost my mother unexpectedly and she was on a 24hour care system whilst I worked full time so that I knew she could get help if she needed it . Yes they will leave people without contact before they will fix the problem. Terrible firm to deal with even if you pay your bills by direct debit. Papers here I come with my story.
Mike,North Dorset,3/10/14,"Originally swapped from a poor broadband service provided by Orange which was unreliable and slow. BT offered a 'professional service' with the home hub 3 which professed to not disconnect at every opportunity, sorry to say we are lucky to get 15 minutes of uninterrupted broadband over the day. Technical assistance from BT's 'technical' department MIGHT be good if English wasn't their second language, infuriating at best and equal to our previous unreliable and slow Orange service.
As a note the free BT sport isn't supported on our smart TV so had to pay to view the so called free package only to view Moto GP, if you're a sad viewer of overpaid footballers you'll be in your element, boring football and more football, another poor service."
Anne O'Brien,Adlington,3/9/14,"Horrendous""service"". No broadband for 2 weeks. Constant phone calls to try and get it sorted. Promises of ""some one will call you back"". Believe me - that never happens. Been on now for 3 days and told Im going to exceed my allowance. Worst decision I ever made to move to BT. DON'T BE TEMPTED. JUST DON'T DO IT!"
jean mc sorley,Co Armagh,3/8/14,"BT ARE THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER CAME ACROSS, They are robbers and don't care , I was sent a bill for one months rent of £98 pound within 3 days I got a reminder with a different quote this time for £158 pound, which I paid straight away without question, which I should not have paid, why was this amount put on top, ringing is no good to these people as its run by talking machines, well my contract is up 1st july and I can not wait, and I wont be paying another penny either, £158 pound for broadband and 19 calls on my phone, shocking, if everyone just didn't take their crap and left, they wouldn't be able to RIP people off, only indian call centers and no disrespect but if you are a bit deaf like me sometimes its hard to take in all they are saying ,I will NEVER in my life EVER be a customer of bt again one greedy rubbish company I am just sorry I paid £158 pound yest, after they got payment they restricted my broadband for almost 48 hours, my daughter had to ring several times and almost beg to get it turned back on again goodbye BT,good riddance robbing pensioners of all the money they have 19 calls and broadband £158 for I month....."
Mr Saleem,Oldbury,3/8/14,"BT Broadband is amazingly bad. I used to be with Sky and never had any issues with my broadband, I wish I never changed. I can't stay connected to my broadband for longer than an hour at a time without it cutting out, the diagnostic tool is just there to waste your time asking you stupid questions and not resolving anything and the customer service is just dire. Each time I've complained they just send me another HUB, blaming the problem on that but it still persists. I've never been so frustrated, I'm stuck in a contract with them but as soon as it ends I will be going straight back to Sky. Please don't get your broadband from BT unless you want to be paying for something you will only receive temporarily."
Joe R,Southampton,3/4/14,"Setup was a nightmare. Utterly horrid. I have never been so stressed before in my life. Despite giving all advanced warning installation only started 2 days after at which point we were informed (after being on the phone for over 2 hours and being transferred to and from 3 different call centres), from the technical support suggesting that I go out and purchase an old fashioned telephone to test the line from my socket to their exchange.
They couldn't make it any faster and it was totally stressful especially with my wife needing internet to study from home in the middle of moving house.
We also had this idiotic broadband talk which was never properly explained to us and seemed to half work and which I asked to be turned off - with the lack of paper bills it was only recently that I noticed that this was *still* being charged for despite my request.
However, speed is good. 18meg/20 consistently, occasionally connection cuts out requiring a hub restart which is a bit annoying. It's fine now, after setup, but the whole process reflects poorly on their customer service. My wife hates the random cut-outs and wants to switch to virgin but their customer support isn't much better."
DT,Enfield,3/4/14,"I thought my case was bad and made me angry. Having read most of the comments here, I was kind of the 'lucky' one. I am so far, happy enough with the technical side of the services. The area that I am not happy about is when contacting the customer services. There was no help in anyway, basically they just want to say ""this is it, take it or leave it"". As an existing customer for almost 30 years, I thought I was loyal, I have never asked for anything eg discount, I pay my bills on time every quarter all these years. But when I decided to upgrade our broadband to infinity 2 (not having it install yet) I will be paying more than a new ""valuable"" customer, no discounted few months offer etc. I was on the phone to BT to sort out some internet problems to start, and was decided to have it upgraded after a long chat with the engineer, I complaint about not being told of some of their offers which I could have had (this was when I realised afterwards) and I was told, as BT personnel, they do not need to tell customer, it is up to us to shop around....bla...bla...bla.

I have been in touch with two officers, this is what they say in the end ""if you are not happy, you can cancel your order""!

Nightmare talking to them!

But thanks for the comments, I will look at the bill more carefully."
Paddy,Cheshire,2/25/14,"I signed up for broadband and calls just over a month ago when i was drawn to the attractive offer of half price broadband for 6 months. Not knowing what my usual usage would be i took the minimum package with 10GB usage per month at £5 per month and then £10 per month after 6 months. I went over the usage in my first month and have already exceeded this months usage. So it is clear to me that i am on the wrong package and should have taken out the unlimited package, also on offer at half price for 6 months. When i have tried to move to the correct package i have been told that i would then pay the full monthly costs of 16.99 and not receive any discount. the discount that persuaded me to join up in the first place. This is because i am not a new customer, even though i have only been a customer for just over a month! I feel I have been tempted into a good deal and then had that deal taken away from me straight away. I am not locked into a 18 month contract feeling disgruntled that i have been mislead. Why they couldn't just let me move to the unlimited package with the half price for 6 months offer i don't know?! It's total BS. I will not be continuing with there service after my contract has run out."
Tom,Cambridge,2/23/14,"I used to have Virgin Media (not my choice but landlords) and oh my god was that the worst. Not only is the speed god aweful but the reliability is a joke.
Switched to BT and i've had fast internet with very little downtime. Best thing is there is no fair-use policy like you do with virgin so I don't get throttled when I need to download something from steam."
Neil,Isle of skye,2/18/14,"I was with talk talk for the last few years. Recently my broadband speeds were down to 0.5 in the evenings making watching youtube or anything impossible. I spent hours on the phone to their help line and had an engineer out who said there was no problem with the line.
I decided to move to bt although the reviews online made me wary. I had good reports from friends who are using bt broadband. I took the plunge and ordered bt unlimited broadband with evening and weekend calls. I received my hub 2 days before connection date. And on the day of connection I was struggling on with my old talk talk connection at a speed of 1.5 and received a text from bt to say my bt broadband was ready to use. I unplugged my old router and plugged in my new bt hub. Took just a couple of minutes including taking it out of the box. The router took a couple of minuted untill the light turned solid blue and typed in the wireless key and password into my ipad and was online. Less than 5 minutes and it was surfing at a speed of 6.5 I have only had it for a week but the speed has remained above 5 in the evenings and during the day. So far very happy but I will write another review if there are any problems at a later date. I still think that getting reviews from friends and neighbours in the local area is far better than online reviews."
naem,shams,2/17/14,"I joined BT on 14/02/14, I have broadband but no land line, over 4 days I am having a hellish time, it is absolute torture, customer service is an incompetent one and have no clue and gives no help whatsoever.
do not join, do not join BT you will regret."
Jon,Surrey,2/13/14,Shocked by BT's customer service/tactics when it came to leaving. First BT operator said they would send out MAC code in post and should arrive 5-10 days. After 2 weeks called again and I was assured MAC code was in the post. Called again after a further week and third operator left me on hold for 18mins only to tell me they would call me back - they never did. Called again to be told that MAC code could in fact be given out over the phone - not impressed. BT = expensive + dreadful customer service. Hopefully EE will be better - they are certainly more price competitive.
Missie,Uk London,2/13/14,"I renewed contract with bt and as the old router was providing never-ending disconnection problem, they sent a new router but the new router was even worse than the old one that the Internet gets disconnected every five secs. I called bt and the tech guys have been doing never ending testing but would never call me back. I had to call back every single time, they promised to call back for four times but never happened. After never ending arguing with hopeless customer option team as well as tech guys for entire three days, I ended up going barking mad at them, and they finally proposed to send a new router. They are just absolutely irresponsible, useless and hopeless in helping or sorting problems out!!!!!!!!! Just can't wait till the contract ends. And no wonder why people complain so much about bt."
G,Argyll,2/11/14,"Reviewing this simply due to the fact of how shocking BT's Broadband is. For the last year the Broadband in our area has been disconnected every second night without fail during peak times for around 1-2 hours, on top of this when it is actually running you are lucky to get any decent usable connection, when streaming video's you are consistently directed to 140P, even on this you still run into buffer problems, whilst contacting customer services about the situation BT essentially said there is nothing they can do until Fibre is installed, even then I doubt their speed will be all that great. Would highly recommend not going with BT for Broadband."
Jeff Parkhouse,Mytchett,2/10/14,"WOW.
What an awful company.
I switched over from Sky Broadband last May, as the current infrastructure only offered me up to 2Mbps, in reality it was only 0.7Mbps.
BT had a fibre backbone, so could offer much higher speeds. I clocked it at around 79Mbps.
After 2 missed appointments, and 2 days off work on my part, I finally had it installed. As a goodwill gesture for wasting my time, the guy on the phone offered me my first 3 months free, which I agreed was acceptable.
After 3 months I got a huge bill for around £190. So I called their ridiculous phone system, and on the 3rd or 4th try managed to speak to someone. They denied all knowledge of this promise of 3 months free, and I urged them to listen back to the phone call as I would like the goodwill gesture that I was offered. They said they would listen to the call, and call me back within 7 working days. 7 days passed, no phone call. I called again (through THAT phone system) and asked why I hadn't received a call. No knowledge of the request. Great. Apologies, blah blah, they will call me back within 48 hours. No call. Getting angry now.
After a few calls on different days, trying to get somewhere, I gave up hope. Very angry at this point.
So I had a moment of madness and decided to email Mr Ian Livingston.
He replied back within about 20mins saying he was very sorry and would pass my details onto a 'top level customer service manager' - sounded promising.
Sure enough, the next day I had a call from a lovely lady. She said she was sorry I've had such a bad start with BT, and that she didn't need to listen to the original call. She will refund all the charges so far, including the late payment fees (I refused to pay a penny until it was resolved).
So, as of 1st October 2013, I was about £4 in credit.
Wonderful result!!
Alas, it has gone downhill from there.
My standard month bill is £44.45, Infinity 2 + line rental.
I don't have a phone connected to the phone line, and BT Infinity 2 is unlimited - so I know what my bill will be each and every month.
Unfortunately the BT computer system doesn't see it this way.
I had a letter saying ""You are using more than you should, so we are increasing your monthly payment to £70 to cover this"".
I was furious.
Every month I call them, speak to managers, other staff, explain the whole story time and time again. I have been on the phone for 2hrs more than once and not got anywhere.
They have taken a total of £350 over the last 5 months (5 x £70), instead of £207.25 (5 x £41.45).
So I figured they owe me £142.75. They refute this.

Another thing is they generate a quarterly bill, which I wasn't told when I entered into a contract. I am also on what they call 'Monthly Billing' as opposed to a standard Direct Debit, all because I wanted the DD to exit my my account on a specific date. This practice is standard in the 'Utilities Industry', apparently. Which is funny because I don't have this problem with my gas and electricity providers.
By having a 'Monthly Plan' (they tell me) that the amount can be adjusted by them each month as they see fit. BS.

All I wanted was a bill each month for my usage. Whether that's in advance or not, I don't really care, because I KNOW what that bill will be because I CAN'T go over my allowances due to it being unlimited and not having a phone connected.

I had my final call about a week ago, and after 2 hrs I asked to speak to the cancellation department. After another lengthy hold, and explaining the whole story AGAIN, the adviser said I couldn't cancel as there was an outstanding debt on the account and I need to speak to billing first. I was furious.
An outstanding balance?? When I am owed over £140??? I couldn't believe it.
Again I was put on hold, back to billing. On hold waiting for a manager... Explain the whole story YET AGAIN... Either he hangs up or we get cut off.

.........

Speechless.

So, I'm still at odds as to what to do.
No matter how many times I speak to them, or who I speak to, I never seem to get anywhere.
Heaven knows how much time and money I have spent calling them from my mobile.

To add insult to injury, Sky released their own fibre service about 2 months into my BT contract.

On another note, 3 weeks ago some nice person decided to crash their car into the green BT node at the end of the street, severing internet and phone connections to my whole street. This is not BT's fault I know, but it took around 2 weeks to fix, with no email or phone call to apologise. I called them to ask why I very rarely saw an Openreach engineer at the crash site. They said they would look into it...

Internet is back now, so I'm expecting a refund for the 2 weeks I had no Infinity 2. What do you think my chances are?"
london789,central london,2/9/14,"15 months without a phone line and without broadband, and BT are sending debt collectors to take £600 off me for a service they haven't provided! This is with the ombudsman now and also registered at ofcom.On the 31st October 2012 I contacted BT and informed them that I would be moving house on the 1st November 2012 and asked for my phone line and internet to be moved as well. The lady seemed intent on selling me the infinity package and I accepted to upgrade to this.

It took you over 6 months for BT to arrange to connect the broadband. I made over 40 phone calls to BT chasing this and all the while from October 2012 - May 2013 they continued to bill me for the phone line in my OLD residence despite not having connected my phone and not providing me an internet service in my new residence where I was now living.

I made several formal complaints to BT, the first being in March 2013 having waited 4 months for a phone line connection but they were all ignored.

Thorughout December 2012 - April 2013 they were unable to arrange a visit to connect the lines - they gave dozens of excuses for the delay, including a claim that I was in a remote area! (i am in central London). Each time I rang I had to explain everything all over again and then they would say they would call back but they never did. I wrote to them but never received a response.

They then left me a voicemail while I was abroad telling me they were going to attend in May to connect my line. I was abroad at the time, so did not pick up their message and was clearly not here in London to let in their engineer. They made no effort to agree the time of the attendance with me first.

At various times BT said they were going to waive the first 2 months or 3 months line rental for the massive inconvenience caused but none of their subsequent bills reflected that.

The phone line and infinity connection was supposed to be as a package of £80 where the phone line connection charge is included but instead they charged me for both separately coming to a total of £130.

BT continued to charge me for a line rental from 31st October 2012 until 25th May 2013 despite not offering any services whatsoever.

They charged me for phone calls made on my old line after I moved out of my last property on 5th November (£130.59 and £26.88) by the new tenants that had moved in and they did not disconnect the phone line in my old property despite a written order form saying they would.

I made several formal complaints to BT but they did not respond to any of them. (they never do apparently)

I then made a complaint to the ombudsman and in response to this BT refused to speak with me at all about my service and disconnected my broadband altogether and charged me a disconnection fee!

A preliminary investigation by the ombudsman asked for BT to pay me £100, a full refund of the excess charged by BT and a formal apology but their bill does not reflect any of this. BT have still not paid a refund. This whole saga has cost me a fortune (60 phone calls to BT from my mobile on their premium line in order to chase up the absent services that they had agreed). I have been obliged to use my mobile phone for international and other calls and this has added several £100s to my expenses over 15 months.

BT did not answer any of my letters or emails and did not respond to 2 more formal complaints submitted by post and by email.

However, they did react to my complaints to the ombudsman by then piling on a late service charge of £7.50, then £2.00 and then proceeded without warning to disconnect my broadband.

BT then added a further disconnection charge.

BT then proceeded to add more and more to the bills despite still not providing a service.

Now I have received a letter from a debt collection agency and from BT to inform me that they have added a further 25% to what BT were billing me previously for 'late payment'.

I would warn all of you out there to avoid this draining and time wasting nightmare. BT is an awful company."
Iolanda Birmingham,Crawley,2/4/14,
Sunthar,London,2/1/14,"So bad. I had a total sky package and wanted to save a few pounds so decided to go to BT but really really regret that decision. If you are ever in my position NEVER CHOOSE BT. Everything has been a disaster, broadband, TV and phone. It has been one problem after another. They can do nothing right and just lie down the phone to you. i have never had such a bad customer experience in my life."
Frank Odell,"Wilton, near Pickering, North Yorkshire",2/1/14,"Absolutely dire, called broadband when I'm lucky if I get 150kb, 1 mile away they enjoy 35MB, BT wont go the mile to our village, pass you around the different centres. Cant wait for 4G to come, we all have mobile contracts with data packages, then BT will be gone. £41 a month they rip me off for, they state on the BT website l get 1-3.5MB, total lies, Rightmove web site speed test states 100kb, that's a realistic figure, THANKS FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BT AND THANKS FOR THE LOST WORK AND THE NON EXISTANT TECHNICAL AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. YOU LIED TO ME AND AS YOU CANT GIVE WHAT YOU PROMISED 3 YEARS AGO, I THINK YOU MIS SOLD ME A PRODUCT, LIED AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE DONE FOR MIS SELLING BREACH OF CONTRACT.
DON'T BOTHER WITH BT IS WHAT L THINK"
LISA,HENGOED,1/30/14,"BT USELESS

Wish I had read all the reviews before ordering BT infinity package - completely disgusted with the customer service. Due to have an engineer on the 22nd of January, turned up but engineer was not qualified to enter attic space and left the property saying someone would come back to me in four days!! Rearranged another appointment for 29 the oh January, waited in all day, no engineer arrived. Rearranged for 30th of January and guess what - no engineer. Wasted three days leave and still no broadband. customer services will lie to you just to get you off the phone. Open reach are next to useless and Kelly Communications send unqualified engineers and you still have to wait 24 hours for a call-back from a trouble-shooting team who will no doubt make promises they can't keep.

DO NOT CHANGE YOUR BROADBAND to BT INFINITY"
neil perks,dy6 9sz,1/29/14,Don't bother worst company I have ever dealed with I have cancelled after numerous calls to get no were
AS79,Streatham Hill,1/27/14,"Absolutely dreadful service DO NOT USE BT. Four times I have been told the fault would be sorted that day and 4 times they have failed to do so and failed to contact me saying there's an issue. Every conversation I have had with them they have assured me it will definitley be done that day and said the issue was at the exhange. I then called today as the fault is still not fixed and was informed that an engineer came to the flat, three days ago; engineer didn't even borther phoning when he couldn't get in. Having not been told soemone was coming I wasn't in. Two days ago I spoke to BT and no reference was made to the engineer turning up the day before and again they assured me it would be sorted within 24 hours. They are now saying thay have to wait three days to update the order (6 days from when the engineer came round)before they even consider dates for a new appointment. Again DO NOT USE BT"
Alan Mumby,"Louth, Lincs",1/27/14,"I have just sent the following to the BBC: Well, it's 2014, I have high-speed broadband, and I can't listen to The Archers on iPlayer because it cuts out every few seconds, sometimes coming up with the 'insufficient bandwith' message. This is for radio, not TV! I'm sending the same email to BT. No doubt you'll both blame each other. Either way, it's a disgrace in this day and age.
Livid of Louth. So now I leave it to you guys - who's going to take the blame, the Beeb or BT? I'm told I have 40meg download speed, and yet I can't stream a radio programme...???"
robert,london,1/24/14,"If you're with Virgin at the moment and tempted to switch to BT because Virgin don't give loyalty points to long time customers, pls don't. You'll end up wishing you're still with Virgin. Internet's so slow, programs don't appear on its TV guide. Can't wait for my contract to end."
Maurice Firman,Somerset,1/24/14,"In a world where Broadband and telephones are just about essential BT cannot allocate an engineer to fix a fault IN THEIR TELEPHONE EXCHANGE in less than a week. We have no useable telephone and no broadband and the earliest they can fix it is January 28th. Perhaps if they took customer service seriously they'd reflect on this employ more engineers and maybe reduce the pay of executives by a small proportion to fund this - the outgoing chief, Ian Livingston, was paid £18.5 million (yes million) last year. An extra engineer or several on £30K or so would hardly dent his pay."
NWB,Devon,1/23/14,BT are a deceitful bunch - I signed up to an 18 month contract with a fixed price of £16 per month. After just 3 months they increased the price from my direct debit. I queried this and was told they were entirely at liberty to do so. If you look at any of their current advertsing it all states fixed prices for the term fo the contract - and dont even try and look at their T&Cs - thousands of pages of them. Just dont ever trust them.
TEJ,BIRMINGHAM,1/22/14,"I ordered my broadband and telephone line on 2nd Jan and was given a date of 21st Jan for installation between 8am to 1pm.Took day of work especailly for this waited and waited until about 2pm an engineer phones as say that he can not fit the telephone toady because of some issues with my previous telephone.
Phoned BT and the call centres are aboard the people working there dont have a clue on what customer service is.Had to re schedule the appointment which was given 10 days time.
BT are the worst company for customer service.
So i cancelled my package with them and i am looking else where.
AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS THEY ARE A BUNCH OF TWATS!!!!"
Amo,stevenage,1/19/14,"I moved from Virgin thankfully to BT (I used to call virgin and ask them for permission to use broadband it was so bad). BT performance has been on the button, no stupid capping, price is lower, I gave 5 to customer service, I have not used them at all in 11 months. so BT have a thumbs up from me, I gave virgin hell they were so bad !!"
Bemused,NI,1/16/14,"Wow I never knew how bad BT were until I tried to contact them. BT are a communications provider.....Right? So why is it impossible to communicate with them? I spent a full day from 9 am to 7.45 pm trying to speak to the options team, who are so named no doubt because it's their option whether they feel like picking up the phone!! I called wanting to discuss my increasing bill and to see if they could match a deal from Talk Talk and eventually someone picked up the phone. I explained that I was being offered the same broadband speed, unlimited, including anytime calls and TV for less than I was being charged by BT for broadband and evening and weekend calls. The response was that Talk Talk are terrible with nonsense reasons why I shouldn't go to them like they would cut me off if I used over £20 of calls! Really my phone provider would cut me off for using the phone? They said I could have a £5 reduction in my bill but they would take away my evening calls!!! Excuse me? Horrendous and they don't care about customers. They have lost this one permanently. Don't touch with a barge pole."
JonP,London,1/14/14,Just awful in every way. We switched from Virgin and have not stopped regretting it. broadband service was extremely patchy and slow for 4 or 5 months. When an engineer finally came after endless phone calls he told us the initial installation was poor and fixed it. Problems continued and we had a 2nd engineer's visit who told us the first engineer had messed things up. He seems to have done a good job and broadband is now ok but we've been charged £130 for the engineer's visit. I'm now on the phone trying to query it. 20 minutes to get through to the billing dept (in India) who told me another dept deals with payments for engineers' visits. Have now spent another 20 mins waiting to get through to them. The customer service is awful. Call centre has been outsourced and the assistants' grasp of English is not great. Avoid BT at all costs.
nicolle macefield,worksop england,1/13/14,it is the worst internet connection ever it never loads anything and all it does it flash orange day and night. its alright until you try to search for something on your laptop or mobile and then it just messes up. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. it terrible.
Flora,Isle of Skye,1/12/14,"We have a holiday home on the isle of Skye. We also have Bt broadband, as this was the only option at the time. We hardly use the Internet, just checking emails or web browsing. Usually use about 1GB a month as download speeds are woeful. So were surprised to get an email from BT yesterday to say we had used 10GB in 10 days, get this, when we were not at the property and the hub is turned off. Thought this would be easily resolved with a call to BT. 1.5 hours on the phone later they will not accept their usage monitor is faulty and want us to upgrade our package!!
Do not touch BT with a barge pole. Customer service is hopeless! The call centre is in India which makes it even more difficult to get any sense out of them as it appears the poor folks on the help desk are reading a script.... Which they repeat like a mantra whatever you say."
Sk,London,1/10/14,
Justin,central London,1/3/14,So frustrating. Just opening the pages to write this review nearly made me lose the will. I haven't waited for pages to load like this for about 7 years. I can't stream anymore - is this a strategy to force you onto fibre optics?
Maverick,Lincs,1/3/14,
Loshe,Oxford,12/25/13,"By infinity...I wonder what it means to bt....

I've ordered fibre optic package on 27th November..
Paid for 1 year advance line rental...I was given 3weeks installation date....on the day of engineer visit v had to stay home coz they said from 1 pm to 6pm slot..waited till 7pm and guess what? No engineer...I've contracted them around 7.10 pm and the lady on the other side (presumably in India)
Had no idea...I was put on hold and was on line for 1hr before she said I will check the progress and someone will call u back within 24hrs....
Guess what, no one called..but I did receive an email saying ur new installation date is 8th January....no apology, no explanation nothing...I was furious as my children were going back to school before that...
The next say I tried to contact them and guess what? I was online for 1hrs and 20 min before I disconnected line...and then I tried again...after long infinity years I gotthrough....
Now I need to return the box back...let's see how it goes......over and defo out...."
Keith,Solihull,12/16/13,"Maybe I am open of the lucky ones. So far, BT have been BRILLIANT. Setup was easy, speed is spectacular, 100% reliable and well worth the extra pennies.
bt+i-Mac is supreme. Thank-you. Keep it up."
Bruce,Lower Beeding,12/16/13,"For years I have suffered with low connection speeds from AOL. I live in very rural location. After 2 engineer visits and countless inane calls to somewhere in India I was still getting speeds of .56 Mbps at peak times, late afternoon and evening. Eventually I switched to BT unlimited broadband and since that day I have a constant speed of 6.5 Mbps and can now watch iplayer, on demand and youtube with no interruptions at all. The changeover was seamless for Broadband and phone and I would not hesitate to recommend them."
keith,solihull,12/12/13,"I appear to be one of the lucky ones. Excellent speeds through copper wire- more than 16mbs on average. Excellent service, well worth the money."
Rob H,Yorks,12/12/13,"I ordered BT Infinity and telephone and received an ""installation"" date of 10 days later. I booked a day off for the engineer as the installation was between 8 and 1pm. The day before I get a text telling me that the date has now changed to a day later! I now took off another day.
The next day, the day my service was originally going to be installed, I received an email telling me that my phone number was now live and my broadband was going to be installed the following day.
The next day I sit waiting all morning....The engineer turns up at 1:30pm! Ok ill let him off...
He tries to install the broadband only to discover that there is no phone line!!! He asked if the engineer had been to install the line...Urm no I thought that you would be doing it.... His reply? He wasn't qualified to work on ""copper"" wire!!!!!

I called BT..... Big mistake. Indian call centre wasn't my issue, staff that passed me from department to department for almost 2 hours is. I started the call at 2pm and finished at 4.15!
Totally useless. I tried to log a complaint and after telling them that there is an external problem with their line at the actual box in the street, I was advised that I should go to another BB provider!!!! Idiots! It doesn't matter which service provider I go to if the problem is with the BT box outside, I will never get a connection!!!

Advice...DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE IDIOTS AND CERTAINLY NOT ON AN 18 MONTH CONTRACT!!!"
Exonian,West Sussex,12/11/13,"I read so many warnings about BT but stupidly took no notice. DO NOT USE THEM. They are terrible. I signed up for BT Infinity in August 2013. They then for reasons best known to BT cancelled my order. I only found out after calling to find out where the engineer was on the installation day. It's now 5 months on and I still only have around 1/3rd of promised download speed with ethernet cable. Next to nothing with a wireless connection. Rang sales to cancel but they were just arrogant and refused my request out of hand despite the product not being fit for purpose. I am now have to have yet another conversation with tech service. They are good people but clearly their job is horrendous because of the lacklustre product. Ignore the advertising claims, they misrepresent the actual performance of BT Infinity. Rest assured, I will take note of others comments in future. Just stay away from BT."
Herminder Singh,Bedford,12/7/13,The worst customer service ever. Been a customer for nearly 30 years and when our router stopped working asked for a new router and was told that we would need to pay for a new one unless we sign up for a new contract. Was not willing to do that as we have been getting the worst download speeds and poor customer service. Decided to sign up with new provider. Customer loyalty means nothing.
John Rumph,Worthing,12/7/13,I switched back to Bt a year ago. I am on Infinity2 which offers up to 76mbps. I get as low as 18. every time I complain my call is put through to India where I am told that they will look into the problem. Their normal response is to send out an engineer. I have now had 4 engineer visits and there is and never has been a problem with my phone. The problem is that I live about 400 yards from my connection box (CAB) and can only expect speeds of up to 26mbps. Until BT is prepared to invest money in their infrastructure instead of TV and European football programmes nothing will change. If your thinking of switching to BT check where your CAB is otherwise your speeds will be slow and BT will not care less.
lamees,london,12/4/13,"if you hate some one really really bad suggest BT to them, they will CRY i promise

i really hope there where ZERO in this rating ,
bt is a the worse broadband and defiantly the worse customer service !"
James Riddell,Wrexham,11/6/13,"Rubbish, can I turn you off 2morrow & go to plusnet? New homepage is useless, can we can have the old btyahoo page back please. BTsport - crap."
Ben,Rattigan,11/4/13,"BT Broadband is very slow less than 500Kbps most of the time. The free BT Sport app is useless and to be honest 3G gives quicker speed than I get. I have tried all the test and actions to improve the speed BT suggest and its no better and getting worse.

It is £30 per month for unlimited broadband and a complete waste of money, will switch as soon as I can."
Abdul,West Yorks,8/25/13,"Signed up to BT broadband so that I could watch BT sport. What a mistake that was. First they got rid of my unlimited free evening calls even though their customer services told me on two occasions that would not change. Now they expect me to pay extra for the evenings call package. Got all the equipment on time and the service started on time and then the real problems began. The internet connection has a mind of its own. Slows down to 0.03Mbps every few hours. Resetting the home hub restores the speed most of the times but not always. After waiting on the phone for about 30 mins each time, technical help go through diagnostics then tell you to switch off all equipment and restart which resolves the issue for a few hours. How long can you keep resetting the router. Try and make a complaint and you just keep going round in circles. They don't want to help and have no idea what customer service is. Can't wait till the 18 months is over. So many better and cheaper deals out there."
Nick,Hertfordshire,8/23/13,"Never get a contract with BT. You will regret it.

When I first signed up to BT on an eighteen month contract, I wasn't worried about the length of this contract due to BT’s “Moving Home” service. I remember thinking, “well if I need to move house after a few months, that’s no problem, I’ll just move my BT service with me”.
When I did move home, I realised just how wrong I was.
I was staying briefly at a friend’s place whilst I was trying to find something new. So I call up BT to try and get my services suspended whilst I find somewhere new. Note I was trying to suspend only my services, not payment, I was happy to keep paying the monthly fee.
BT tell me they can’t suspend internet services, and can only block outgoing calls for a fee (of £25, despite the fact that it took them a minute to do). So I had to settle with the thought that the new tenant of my old flat could use a BT router to access heavens knows what on a connection in my name, and only me paying £25 was stopping him from doing the same with the phone line.
So when I complained to BT on the phone about this, they informed me that they are unable to suspend a service. I emailed several times, and eventually received one reply which stated that not only would I have to accept any charges for SOMEONE ELSE using my services, but that if someone moved into my old place and set up internet there before I could move my services somewhere else, I would be charged the cancellation fee (of £200), even though this is something I have no control over and was not attempting to stop or suspend paying my monthly fee.
So I complained to the communications ombudsman. It took two months for them to get back to me with an answer. They were polite enough but frankly have no clout whatsoever. They said they couldn’t deal with this as it was a “commercial decision made by BT” (as in something BT is doing? So what exactly can they deal with?). Nor did they make any reference to my complaint at being charged £25 for BT to block outgoing calls from my number. The ombudsman is useless and clearly don’t challenge BT at all. I shouldn’t have been too surprised seeing as how readily BT advertise going to them on the BT website.
My advice, no matter how tempting a BT contract may look, DON’T DO IT! There customer service is non-existent and they squeeze money out of for doing (poorly) things they should already be doing."
Irisblue,Aberdeenshire,8/6/13,"Would have preferred zero star rating for this company. I am told by the callcentre in India that I should be grateful for download speeds of 0.30 mbops & upload speeds of 0.09 mbops, as I live way out in farmland!!! Oh, and I should be pleased to pay £25 a month for this ""service"" - and by the way, BT gives no guarantee of decent speeds for a WIRELESS connection. Yep, this was the latest in their list of excuses. If BT had the honesty to tell me this mumbo-jumbo when I discussed the contract with them. I would have gone elsewhere."
Vaughan W. Evans,Glenburn Paisley PA 2 8LJ,8/4/13,"We have been BT customers forever yet when I terminated the useless unwanted wifi with no signal, BT never consulted me about continuing with our Basic Broadband tel service ...low usage for my disabled brother Vaughan W. Evans . Instead without asking what service they cut off wifi which we wanted ...but NOT our regular Basic Broadband tel only that we've had for years and years paid through Direct Debit. My brother's Emergency Alert Alarm no longer is connected and that company say they can't connect us up again. ...it is the error of our provider BT. We are desperate now without a phone for all the services that are part of the NHS network . The house is DEAD now without any rom of communication. IMMEDIATE HELP IAS REQUIRED BY LAW FOR AN AILING DISABLED SENIOR . I AM THE VISITING SISTER STANDING BY AND WILL WAIT FOR YOUR CLL RE CONNECTING THE PHONE AGAIN.
WE BOTH ARE WITHOUT A CELL PHONE AND KNOW OF ANYONE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO MY BROTHER AND ME ."
Aaron,Bromsgrove,7/28/13,"connection tests prove 95% efficiency from the stated maximum for Infinity Option 1, the cabinet is right outside my house with a short length of cable to the telephone and then on to the house, the connection has been stable for well over 3 months now and is totally secure through a corporate grade hardware firewall, well done BT, it is all as it says on the tin !!!"
dizbuster,Melton Mowbray,6/26/13,"Not exactly as promised. Would expect nearer 70MbSec contacted Customer Services, nothing done."
P Smith,Wallsend,5/1/13,I was a bit disappointed with my speed at first but since I've changed my wireless adapter I've noticed a distinct difference and am now getting the speed I was promised.
Moriarty7,Burton on Trent,2/10/13,"Sorry to say, just about the worst Broadband reliability ever and after suffering for 4 years am going over Infinity 2. Will report back in due course. The customer service from India is 200%, they are so attentive and if they say they will call back in 2 days at a given time, they do. Pity the rest of BT cannot do likewise."
herbie,worcester,2/9/13,good overall but call centres in india a no no can not understand the plus very patronising
louise aconley,scarborough,1/22/13,"never had such poor service my download speed is impossible at 0.3mbs supposed to be 8.0mbs. the indian speaking call centre is a disgrace saying there is no problem with my service. when my contract is up I will not be staying with bt, as I am paying for something which 9 times out of 10 I carnt even use and when I can it is too slow to do anything."
Cheryl,Bristol,10/25/12,"So disappointed with BT. Decided to change suppliers and go with BT, with reassurances from BT that Infinity would work well. Engineer turned up, very grumpy and rude because he had to change junction box. Couldn't set up, said he was going to the main box to reset everything, never returned. Turned up the next day did the same and disappeared - still no broadband. Rany customer services, job marked as complete by engineer! All customer services could do was give me BB fault number - why am I paying over £25 a month for such appalling service?!"
Peter,Raymonds Hill (near Axminster),9/8/12,Broadband speed from the Axminster BT Exchange is ABSOLUTELY APPALLING!! I'd happily pay more for a faster broadband.
Chris,Bridgend,8/23/12,"Worst days work I ever did going back to BT. 60% slower than they promised constant loss of connection, don`t call you back when they say they will, and waited in for 5hrs for an engineer that never turned up. An absolute shambles, come back Sky all is forgiven!!"
DONNA,HORDEN,7/10/12,I have just sign up with BT hub 3 and it is the worst thing I have done big problems with speed fed up how slow this is and I am paying £37 a month for this. Not happy.
HAW,"Birstall, Yorkshire",6/16/12,"We have had BT Broadband for about 10 years. The first years were pretty good with download speeds in the 3Mbps range. Then we started to get truncation which would make games laggy and frustrating but we thought, hey, new technologies are on their way and BT is worth supporting. This past year or so things have gone from bad to worse and my 'hobby' is speaking to polite but powerless call centre staff who tell me that I have no problems. I have dropouts numerous times a day, an IP profile that has fallen to 0.5Mb as a result and numerous visits by Openreach to make the problem go away for a week or two only. Birstall is a slow spot now it seems but nobody has reduced my £26/month service charge to match."
George,Lancaster,5/1/12,"With the introduction of BT Infinity 2, I was given an estimate of 57Mbs download and 20Mbs upload. I am consistently getting 70+Mbs down and 14 - 17.5Mbs up. Very pleased with the sevice. Line profile did vary by 20% in first 3-4 days but has now stabilised at 77Mbs+"
anthony cattani,spalding,4/19/12,This speed has slipped from 6mbps to less than 2mbps
Lower Farm,Noke,1/7/12,"0.078 Mbps speed test says it all and only five miles from Oxford city centre in a decent sized village! BT are the only provider available and have done nothing to improve the service, yet charge double that of other quality suppliers. 1 Mbps would be adequate, to get less than 10% of that means a simple page like this takes 20 seconds to load."
sandeep,high street north,11/2/11,"i pay £28 a month for this crap of mine..!! what a shame, b.t. have let me down big time. iam so annoyed..!! it wont even reach a mere 1 mbps. what a disgrace. pls help."
Alan Smith,Newhey - Rochdale,10/18/11,"I have had a couple of problems with my Broadband
over the past couple of years with BT. However on contacting them my problems have been dealt with efficiently and quickly. On the last occasion they even sent an engineer around the next morning and as a result my broadband was back online faster than ever. They may be a bit more expensive than some other providers but service they offer is worth every penny. I certainly can recommend BT."
david,"cupar, fife",8/21/11,Far too slow when I am only a mile and a half from Cupar Exchange. BT give little comfort and seem to be able to change the speeds from 0.1 to 1.33 !!
Tony,Leeds,7/29/11,"bt broadband infinity ???
it takes an infinity to get online and then takes an infinity to open a webpage, my average speed 0.2meg and im lucky if it stays connected for more than 15 min at a time, bts excuse the wire from the cabinet to my house is too old and in poor condition, they will replace it if i pay."
Vampire1408,East London,7/26/11,"BT is terrible! Been on it for years with a up to 8meg package, 10 GB max bandwidth and my local area with bt is 3mps, while my actual speed with bt is 1-300kbps! I've contacted BT on many occasions but they ignore me and tell me it's my fault, my problem... even when I moved house, changed equipment etc - BT sucks! Stuck with a terrible connection, their customer services are the worst and atm the connection drops out A LOT! Worst time was keeping disconnecting and reconnecting constantly for hours - so no connection! My opinion, DON'T USE BT! Unreliable, slow speeds, bad customer service and overall ... bad!"
Jim Lee,Southampton,6/20/11,"Periodic problems with Broadband speed dropping from over 6Mb/s to 1.5Mb/s. Repeated calls to customer service, and interminable waits in automated telephone sytem, bring promises of corrective action from 'an engineer will call' on 'date and time' to 'fault is at the Exchange and will be corrected in next few days. No improvement has resulted. Fed up with being treated like somebody who does not matter. Equally fed up with BT's general attitude to me as a customer, including the Highway Robbery of demanding extra money for not setting up a Direct Debit with them. And they think, after the fiascos of trying to get some action on Broadband speeds, I would trust them with a free hand to raid my Bank Account!!!!"
fad,Barnsley,6/15/11,Crap! Speeds at one tenth the so called best in our area. The advertising just goes on telling lies and there's always the getout of 'up to ...'
Jimmyb01,London,6/8/11,"I have been with BT for a number of years, they promised infinity last year, just been told it will be another six months! I can hardly finish a game on FIFA 11 without it dropping. I'm moving to sky, I like the look of anytime +"
rclark,,5/21/11,
gsd166,Cannock,5/21/11,A good quality service and value for money. Have tried others and BT are the best.
Mike Dawson,Wisbech,5/14/11,Lucky if I get 50kbps - I had better reliability with dial up!!
J H Pascoe,Cornwall,5/5/11,"In Feb 2011 I was getting a speed of 6909 since then it has dropped to 720
I have contacted BT and cannot seem to get a improvement"
Peter French,Wroxham,4/26/11,"Best performance is 1.8Mbps; the last 3 days 135Kbps; rang to complain got to Indian callcentre (english spoken very poor) may take 10 days to fix!!
Poor service."
msander,spalding,4/7/11,"Awful, constantly lied to when phoning up. Speed was 4.3M for a few weeks then they decided that a paying customer should only have 2.8M Yet I am not a heavy user. These jokers give the min speed they have to."
Sussex,Sidlesham,4/6/11,"Using the same equipment (Line,Computers & wiring ) as previous provider ( Plusnet ) but BTs' wireless Hub 3 - used wired Cat5 - my overall speed and 'reliability' and lack of tech support went from Bad to Appalling.
New Delhi Call Centre is the best thing about BTs' ""service"" !
Another ""Non Customer Facing"" outfit where THEY contact YOU, but YOU cannot contact THEM without devoting hours and hours to phone calls - email contact not allowed !!
I have a 25% DOWNTIME record so far - and counting.....
THEY (BT) are VERY GOOD at sending out BILLS - pity their service lacks value IMHO."
C,Bedford,4/5/11,Good service from BT but cabling needs upgrading and therefore very slow broadband in the area
Chris,West Hallam,3/16/11,
Mark Whitwell,Gerrards cross,3/2/11,The very low speeds do not allow any training videos to be watched.
George Burns,Leicester,2/20/11,absolutely useless 20/02/2011 speed 0.13mbps they tell you engineer is working on it. no results on improvement since oct 2010. i will change asap
Mike,Axminster,1/27/11,"Switched from Pipex to BT I was told it would be faster but no real difference. The switching process was awful BT in breech of contract twice legals pending. Customer service absolute chaos Mind you so was pipex, talk talk. No money has been invested in Axminster exchange for years total rip off for what you get."
Gavin,Glasgow,10/30/10,"A complete and utter waste of money. Poor speed of 58.Mbps. Terrible customer care/service and you get put through to India to people who can't understand a word you say. I am paying for a service that has crashed twice in a year,the first being a local exchange problem that took 10 days to fix, with lots of fobbing off by customer service in between."
kate follows,nottingham,10/20/10,"I am on option 3 and took out Bt as I was promised 4mg.I have always got 2 or 2.5,until it hit the decks a few weeks ago at 0.06!!!!!
After a new hubb and filters Bt engineer came out today and saw that my Bt extention was installed with thin internal wire and had perished on the outside of the house.He said i would never have got good broadband with that wiring.They have now put the correct wiring in and a new linebox which doesn,t require filters.
Straight away speed is up to 2.2 and am told it should settle to about 3.2 mgs over the next 10 days.
customer services told me there was nothing wrong with my connection a month ago.Two weeks ago someone else at customer services confirmed that my line had a problem.
seems i have had the wrong wiring for 6 years which was ok until I tried to run broadband off it."
Brian Brown,Oxfordshire,10/16/10,"We have BT Broadband Option 3, with a Home Hub v2.0 (wireless n). Performance is pretty good (7MB download) but the connection has a nasty habit of going down 2 or 3 times a week.
The hub is great - we have 3 PCs wired into it, and run my daughter's laptop, 2 XBoxes and 1 PS3 all wirelessly onto it. Performance wise it is very good.
Customer service wise though BT are a laugh - rather like a bloke trying to get into a woman's pants they will say anything to you, and afterwards they will dump you and ignore you."
NUTTS5,Crumlin,10/1/10,Very happy with service in general except with speed. But told system being updated to fibre optic in jan 2011. apart from that excellent service and customer service couldn't be more helpful
NCW,chelmsford,9/21/10,"absolutely shocking!
we dont get half the channels and the ones we do are always juddery and cut out, the on demand tv works about 20% of the time, got solf movie channels but all of them are pay-per-view. the phone line is crackley and the internet needs to be restarted every half hour or so. Also even though we have 'unlimited' internet we got charged £100 for excessive usage (thanks to the flatmates bf!)
we have never been on hold for less than 30 mins when trying to get help and their explanation was that we lived in a poor reception area... why did you recommend this package, charge and install it for us then!?!
this is our first flat and internet ect was the one luxury item we had on our budget. thoroughly disappointed in BT and would never EVER recommend."
Greg,"Dronfield, Sheffield",9/19/10,"After another problem, this week at 330k on my line and being reported by the ""technical specialists"" at BT as working fine at 7MB (which I've never had!! 2MB at best when it works) I've had enough. CONTRACT TERMINATED!"
Peter Crosland,Barnsley - the S. Yorks one - sadly,9/8/10,"Pathetic in all aspects, donload speed 0.4mb to virtually zero at peak times. Died altogether for a week. Customer service is exotic but not very useful.
The one area they score big time is billing - they sure know how to do that! Try anywhere but hereI wouldn't even give them one star for some areas but zero not an option."
David Heale,Weston-Super-Mare,8/27/10,"The only reason I am posting a comment is that I have just phoned BT, which took numerous numbers to phone, to upgrade from Option 1 to option 2. Having agreed the upgrade I asked the question about whether this was a new contract, to which the answer was yes. I cancelled it there & then as I only have 4 months left on my current contract & feel it's a complete con., to start another 12 month contract, especially when I found out only by asking the question.I am an existing BT customer & would stay, but my current view is that I will now move."
george,dumfries,8/26/10,"Been with BT for years, very reliable service. Paying for up to 8 MG - never had better than 3.5 - they are now advertising ""up to 20"" - I feel that I am paying for this but not close to getting any improved service/speed - paying for unlimited download, had 3 teenagers home from uni at christmas - got ""fair useage"" warnings threatening to slow my download speed - how much slower can it get ? - bills are useless - no idea what I'm paying for - just know that it is costing over £50/month for broadband/ phone line and calls - all on the cheapest rate ! - Overall view - they are ripping me off and hiding it in confusing bills etc"
Patricia Smith,Airdrie,7/14/10,
Gamgigo,North east England,7/11/10,"The broadband speeds were originally terrible (30kbps for downloading files (upload speed) and 1mbps for browsing (download speed)) but have now increased to 250kbps upload and 1.5mbps download. These speeds are currently a lot less than BT state, also the spees drops during large file transfers. Their customer service is terrible when we called the helpline all the said was 'We cannot help'. They wanted to sell us BT vision by phone, it was an incovinient time, so we told them to call back later, they never did."
Robert Armstrong,Buxton,6/23/10,"speed has dropped from a download of 1.8/2mps to 0.3mps and Bt helpdesk insist thisis because of distance from the exchange, 3.1km,as an BT pensioner I am seriously considering changing isp"
minx,monmouth,6/15/10,"Utter rubbish, 8 weeks we have been telling BT that even though we have a line speed of 5.5meg we can only dl at 1meg max. We are giving up and looking for another ISP. BT can’t/won’t fix this problem for us the India call centre have no clue full stop. Engineers keep saying it’s a software problem with BT Wholesale but India call centre keep sending engineers to property/exchange to perform the same checks over and over again. We could dl at 4.5meg then dropped overnight to 0.5meg. We can't move forward past the same processes. India technical support is the worst, only web based compliants proceedures available and no one calls you about your complaint. You get an automated email and you are left to be worn down and give up by the India call centre."
B Woolhouse,Garthorpe,6/9/10,Been with them for three weeks and to say I'm disappointed is a understatement. Its like dial up very poor.
David,Seaford,6/8/10,Although living less than a mile from the ADSL2 enabled exchange BT say 6.9 mb's is about my limit and supplying me with a 20mb line is pointless. All the shouting from BT about rolling out new high speed services seems somewhat over enthuisiastic.
Anonymous,brighton,6/2/10,
John,"Bromsgrove, Worcs",5/20/10,"Extremely frustrating experience, speed drops frequently, customer service is run out of India.
BT should be a flgship Britih provider, but they are sadly lacking in all areas of cstomer satisfaction."
Graham,London,5/13/10,"In 12 months with BT I only got speed of 0.8 mbps. I was supposed to be able to get 3-5 megs but only got that speed when I complained, even then it lasted only a day or two before going slow again. They lied constantly, never gave anywhere near a good service and deliberately slowed the speed down to 0.13 mbps when they found out I was switching to someone else. Absolute rubbish service, product. They seem to be more concerned with advertising their products rather than providing a good, reliable service."
Mark,Aldershot,4/28/10,"Poor speed and disconnects of its own accord. Pay for 8mb and recieve a high 1.5, finally called BT and they said we where in a low demand area, although we are in a high competitive area, was also informed on upgrade the connection was due to be upgraded, this was 4 years ago???? Seriously considering changing to another provider"
Bill Medford,Aberdeen,4/26/10,"Broadband speed is extremely inconsistent - varying from 4Mb+ to 0.5Mb-all the time. BT tech employees all appear to be in India with consequent language problems. Despite numerous complaints no lasting improvement has been achieved.The problems always seem to be blamed on ""work"" going on at the exchange!"
Maria,Luton,4/22/10,"I have been with BT Broadband for 3 years now and complained as I was only getting half a MB speed. BT kept telling me I was too far away from the exchange, I have since found out I had a tag on the line and BT removed this so I am now receiving about 2 MB. It is a shame they did not sort this out from the begining so that I could have not had to suffer such a slow down load speed and made numerous phone calls. My advice is do not give up and keep on at BT until they send out an engineer who can test what speed your actual line is capable of on their meters.I also suggest you ask them to check if your line is capped or tagged!
Hope anyone reading this can get their service improved like I have as customer service gives lots of conflicting information and occasionally you will get a good BT staff member who goes out of their way to help you instead of consistently being fobbed off.
Thank you BT for eventually sorted it out and can I get a refund?"
Geof,Oakley,4/5/10,Beats Freeserve/orange hands down. Very easy and efficient change over.Much faster up and down loads.
extremely dissatisfied BT customer,"Burntwood, Staffs",4/5/10,
Mr Booth,Hastings,3/31/10,"I'm sad to even give BT 1 star. there service is appauling, they lie and when not lieing to the customer and trying to explain very bad speeds they either havent got a clue or try to balme it on you. At one point i was told to fix it my self from now on and another instance left on hold for 6 hours. I got 6-7 mbs when i frst joined on an 8 meg line now i have 20 meg and get from 76kbs to 1.7meg. I would stear well claer from BT as its some times hard to understand there customer support because of there very strong foreign accents. BT realy dont even deserve a star. Terrable service speed and they havent a clue at all."

William Smyth,Donaghcloney Craigavon Co Armagh NI,1/20/10,"I live in the Lagan Valley (the largest populated area in Northern Ireland)and my Broadband Speed varies between 0.310mb and 0.120mb, BT's charter stipulates that all households would have a mimnimum speed of 0.512mb by 2009. I am registered Disabled and use my computer for shopping etc. My computer is only one year old running Vista. BT are absolute rubbish at getting anything done to speed my broadband up. They are helpful on the phone but useless on the ground."
lee sibley,ickenham,1/8/10,"Speed less than 1MB in our area! Pointless going to other Broadband providers if the BT line is hopeless, which is really frustrating. Hopefully when BT finally get around to installing Fibre Optic cable it will even out the playing field more.Did not tell us contract had expired after one year! Technical department in India as usual & sounds that far away on the phone. Hopeless with MACs as well. Just moved to Virgin so we will see how they do!"
Iain Wicks,"great Bromley,Colchester,Essex",1/5/10,the speed is absolutely appalling-480k upload 350k download and is sold as up to 8MB.
David Mason,"Rochester, Kent, UK",12/23/09,BT Yahoo is the internet connection I use. I have Option 3 for the internet connection and full week no cost for land line calls on a BT line. It works OK but I'm certain it is not the most I could get from BT for the money I am paying.
Roger Wheatley,Woodborough Nottinghamshire,12/22/09,"Have had an issue about speed with BT since I switched to them.People next to me on same company are getting between 2.00 and 3.00MB I was getting 0.9 at good times. Have complained to BT who sent an engineer out to test the line and said nothing wrong with your house wiring system and nothing wrong with the line to the house, I asked about the other peoples speed he said just one of those things. When he left my speed has now gone to 1.6 now strange that it has but still not good enough as the engineer said I should be getting three."
Nigel Bruce,Cumbria,12/22/09,"best download speed 0.83mbps and upload 0.32mbps pretty hopeless.Most video clips wont play properly, stop start all the way through,only getting 1 tenth what I should be,really I should be only paying for what I'm recieving 50p a month,trading standards maybe?"

john upton,chorleywood,12/17/09,we 're supposed to get 20mb but are getting less than 1/2 a mb
Arthur,Noble,12/15/09,Much too slow broadband speed. Customer service (if you can contact anybody) practically non-existent. Utterly hopeless. I am thinking of changing. I am paying BT for 8 Mb and getting an average download speed of 1.87 Mb and an average upload speed of 0.32 Mb. This is absolutely pathetic.
iain,kinross,12/14/09,"Option 3 un-capped. However, it appears to be capped at 300k/s d/l speed. BT should have it's virtual monopoly on lines removed, I do not recommend them."
Roger Wheatley,Woodborough Notts,12/7/09,BT claims 8mb but I have never had more than 0.9mb even though they claim I should get 1.5 on my phone line I have tested it on quiet times so there are no excuses about too many people using Broadband in this area.. When I put in the post code they claim 4mb. Come on BT you should be able to do better thasn this
colin rees,wrexham,12/6/09,customer service very very poor un able to achieve download speeds promised when signing contract
ROB,LLANIDLOES,11/27/09,"BT provides a below average service, it's rather like all services in a rural area, there aren't any. You have to live in a city area to get the rated service. This will always be so, where I live the majority of the population are sheep."
c hart,East wellow,11/26/09,"Despite all the adverse criticisms sites like yours like to promulgate, I have found BT very responsive to requests for help with problems and overall to provide a quite acceptable service"
John Fegan,Whitehead,11/22/09,As usual advertised speeds of 8Mb don't even come close to the actual figure of 1Mb even though i am quite close to the exchange. If this god forsaken town had any choice when it came to suppliers I would change without hesitation.

Geoff Mitchell,Chippenham Wilts,10/22/09,Speed only inceases for a short time after a complaint has been made to the help desk. I have to monitor my broadband speed weekly for performance. I have had a BT engineer who tested my line at 3+ Mbs loopback with a CRC of zero errors. However the max download I have achieved today is 2.1 Mbs. Although at present I'm back at 1.1 Mbs. If it was not for my Bussiness E-Mail address I would move providers. The Bt Help desk ( India) is one of the biggest wastes of time both trying to understand the poor english spoken and the constant referral that it is my equipment that is the cause of the problem.
Andrew,Edwards,10/21/09,Since being with BT my Download and upload speeds seem to have slowed down.
jean aldrich,west sussex,10/20/09,I can say nothing positive about BT. I cannot wait until December when I will be free to chose new provider.
Henry Shannon,"Hayes, Bromley",10/18/09,My so called 8mb connection often runs at 75k during peak times and lately doesn't work at all at times. I live a few hundred metres from the exchange.
Phil Evans,Headcorn Kent,10/14/09,Pathetic speeds!
steve,norfolk,10/14/09,BT seem to consider themselves as gods. and we are the lowly mushrooms that are kept in the dark and fed..... well you know. when someone knows more than the people in the Indian call centers it causes them problems. but nothing ever gets done. an engineer may call round but all he will do is tell you the same info as your router. it is a wonder how they can justify the extra costs of their product. i think a more reliable service could be gained with a telegraph machine opperated by monkeys
will Youing,isle of Islay,10/12/09,Once again BT can't live up to their advertising they can't even give me half a meg so how are they going to deliver 20meg they should not be allowed to advertise what they cant deliver to all
Graham Wale,South East London,10/10/09,"The speed is average but drops considerably on a regular basis, far too unreliable."
Philip,Gretton,10/9/09,Has never been good. BT seems to involved whoever supplies. Got better once now worse than for a long time.
Marty Ward,Sunderland ( Tyne & Wear),10/9/09,Low speed as opposed to the published speed ! Line check carried out and all ok. Moved router to a short direct connection to the main bt box and disconnected all other devices. Ran the speed check again and it was still low.
Jimbo,Sittingbourne,10/1/09,BT Business customer - very happy with price and performance.
Wan Yeu,Derby,9/29/09,Very poor connection at times. Helpdesk appeared not knowing how to diagnose the problem efficiently
Robert Sullivan,basingstoke,9/29/09,"Although being upgraded to the 20MB option I think BT did this network upgrade in my area before it was totally ready. This is born out by the drop in downloading speed initially, compared to my 8MB option previously.I do not like the Indian call centre for support because I cannot always understand what they are saying.Bring back call centres to this country for a customer friendly service."
chris lampitt,cornwall,9/24/09,"promised a speed of 2.5-3 mbps, never had such a speed in 10 months of being with them. The best we have had was 1.5 for 2 days, average is 500 kbps, but normally speed is between 400-30 kbps ( yes 30 kbps slower than dial up modem )speed up to the router as 8 open reach engineers will testify is 2.5 mbps, so line etc is OK, but b.t. keeps the speed low at their end."
J Powell,windlesham,9/23/09,Dismal speed.Indian call centre.Speaks volumes.
Adam,Cheshire,9/18/09,BT has to one of the worst run companys i have ever been with. The customer service is terrible and the speeds which they say you will get are a complete lie.
Rob,Buckingham,9/16/09,"Its ok if nothing goes wrong, but any ""Techie"" calls go to India and the English is barely understandable - no use when trying to explain things. I was trying to get to the bottom of why I was getting a low signal but I couldn't understand what the Indians were saying and they couldn't understand me !! Left in the lurch."
Brian King,enfield,9/14/09,"After 7 years of support to BT, I still pay £26.99 per month for about 1.88Mbps download. I have asked BT for a fixed IP address as compensation for such poor download speeds in order that I can host an exchange server, but they have declined stating I should re-sign up to a business account, but the speed may well stay the same as it is now."
W Davies,Home,9/12/09,Difficulty undrstanding customer Services
Steven Roberts,"Harrow, North London",9/9/09,My line is ADSL2+. I am 850 meters from the exchange. The internal wiring in new. I am getting 750kbps downstream.
Peter Taylor,Eaton Socon ST NEOTS Cambs,9/8/09,"SKY was very slow and timed out regularly and particularly in on-line auctions. This resulted in not being able to bid and losing items by the time of re-setting back. SKY also sometimes completely disappeared just leaving LAN connections and no (Big Computer Icon)Internet Connection. I joked when leaving SKY I could 'RUN FASTER' :-) The upgrade they gave me for an extra five pounds a month was no better. I did give them a chance but nothing changed. To-day I received and setup the BT hub package I ordered.It was effortless,in fact all I did was connect the wiring(ADSL Filter,Phone Wire and LAN wire). It is so fast 100% faster than SKY nearly 6mb to SKY's 3-4mb. I'm glad I switched to BT, a better service for less."
graham,warrington,9/6/09,"very poor speeds, Dial up was faster, average speed is around 180KBps - 240 Kbps (or 0.18 -0.24Mbps). Ringing customer services gets the same responses, although we told you it would be a 4Mbps line that is a maximum and I can see you were suposed to be quicker I change that for you now. Every 6 months you ring the speed increases to 2 - 3Mbps and then slows down with in a few weeks."
JOE BETTERIDGE,YORK,9/6/09,"They, BT , are a joke. I pay for up to 2MB per second. I get 320kbs. The service is not good, they take the micky. You are unable to speak anyone who is interested. If you complain enough the speed may improve, for a short time!"
mikle coker,wiltshire,9/3/09,"I was promised three Mb, but have never had it for more than a few minutes. For months they were replacing lines in the area, during which we seldom had more than 0.5 Mb, and many times my IP profile gets 'stuck' at 130K, and can stay down often for a week at a time, until my frantic telephoning persuades somebody to move their finger to press a button and reset it. I cannot tell you how many hours I have been on the phone."
Chapman,"Wiltshire, UK",9/3/09,"Since competition came into our area, BT has always demanded a high price for their ASDL. Now they are around 50% cheaper without explanation, other than I can never achieve a good connection. I discovered I have been double interleaved at the node, and as very very few suppliers will ever divulge the contention ratios, I suspect I'm sharing a measly 8mbps with 500 people."
Nigel Fletcher,southend on sea,9/2/09,"I have just moved over from Zen internet which was 100% reliable, but limited to 2 meg speed to BT business. I now get 120k download and trying to get any sense out of BT is utterly impossible, they have always had a reputation, but naïvely I though that they had improved. Each time I get through to them, they promise action, but each any every time they let me down. So now I'm stuck, with a ""virtual dial up connection speed"" and nowhere to turn. So dont be fooled, they were bad, they have a bad reputation and more importantly, they are still as bad as they have ever been. I would steer clear like the plague."
Mick,tadcaster,9/2/09,"Had better service and reception from Tiscali faster down loads and no limit, pitty they over charged us"
martin,durkin,9/1/09,"Bt should spend some of their millions doing up all their network to fibre optic, as we find out in local areas like easterhouse barlanark springburn carntyne they dont get the promised 8meg broadband we get 2 if we are very lucky last night mine dropped again to under 1 meg which is appaling as i pay the same price that other people do who get 8mb and above."
Robert Bell,Bell,8/31/09,Should you not get what you pay for?
gh,gu47,8/28/09,This company needs taking to task as I feel that they take your money under false pretences
Robert Hinds,"Tattershall, Lincolnshire",8/28/09,"Speed check is shocking, considering I was getting a faster connection in the North of Scotland with BT. The wireless is awful Hub V1. I live in a small 3 bedroom house and my playstation 3 cannot connect when downstairs as hub is upstairs"
Martin Ralph,Albourne West Sussex,8/28/09,"BT have always tried hard to help me, but am faced with speed problems which do not seem to get cured.I am aware being in the country speed can be a big issue, but problem speed has been the main issue for some time."
carole,stoke golding,8/25/09,"Although I am grateful that we have broadband,the speed jumps around like crazy.Some times of the day and weekend,you could pull it with a piece of string between your teeth faster.It makes gaming almost impossible.Almost as bad as dial-up."
b hayman,norfolk,8/25/09,just rubbish for too much money
Chris,Oxford,8/24/09,"I'm paying for up to 8mb per per second, I should be getting about 4.8mbps as that what the line currently supports and a BT engineer has confirmed this.For the last couple of weeks I've been watching my service disintegrate before my eyes and despite countless call to BT's support line, nothing's changed. I've swapped out my router, my cables and my filters, no change. my latest test results, download speed of 0.27 mbps and upload speed of 0.29 mbs are about average for the last couple of weeks, although my download speed has been down as far as 0.06mbps! The only reason I've rated the service as very poor is that I can't rate them any worse."
Rod Hudson,Burtonwood,8/21/09,Problem has been ongoing for about 7 weeks. Underground work needs to be carried out. I was told it had been carried out but it is supposedly being carried out today. They told me lies and broadband speeds are pathetic - 332kbbs download 328 kbps upload.Would not recommend BT.
John Hall,Belfast,8/21/09,"pricey, but very good service and speed"
stuart Logan,Winkleigh,8/19/09,"A disgrace, being led to believe a given speed. And finding out out that the claims is nowhere near what was said. legealised fraud."
Gareth Hughes,"Bridgend, Wales",8/18/09,Download speed is a rubbish 400kbps!!
Clive McGinn,"Sherborne, Dorset",8/17/09,Terrible broadband performance at around 0.3Mbps being delivered after a recent housemove.
Debbie,Elstree,8/9/09,Get very good speed and home hub is excellent
Lyndon Davy,"Swansea,UK",8/8/09,"Service liable to cut off,even told network is busy yet I pay and only get low speeds,so presumably my low speed connection is cut off while others paying the same but with more than 10 times my connection speed are getting service."
Mr Craig Warne,"St Columb Major, Cornwall",8/8/09,"It says my line's good for 6MB/S, i'm downloading/streaming at 7.1MB/S. Always on, Very reliable."
Janice Pattinson,England,8/7/09,"we have never had wireless broadband, had to use ethernet cable, is so slow unbelievable. after numerous calls with very little useful help, engineer found we have a faulty service cable to property, still not fixed. quite often we have no access to internet at all for long periods of time, customer service is a lol. cost nearly 50 pound a month, bt vision not available at all. still given runaround every time we call, not to mention total chaos with biling. if we ever get a decent tel line, will change asap. in short bt a waste of money,time,"
FOX,NORFOLK,8/7/09,At the moment I am paying £37 a month to receive between 150-380 kbps. Every time I complain it raises to about 1.4 mbps which is still not very good. Methinks it is time to stop the direct debit.
John Taylor,United Kingdom,8/7/09,"The response from BT is good, but you are talking to somebody in India, although they are always polite and helpful, it is sometimes hard to understand them, I was told I could achieve up to 5megs if I went with BT, for months I never got more than 485 kbps downloading, I tried every way to try and improve the speed myself, but to no avail, I bought and fitted an Iplate, but got no improvement, I have spent endless phone calls to the BT help desk, they have eventually got my speed up to just over 2 megs downloading and around 450 kbps uploading,"
MR AND MRS BT LOVER,MALV ERN worcester,8/6/09,"MAKE no mistake BT cost a bomb and charge TOO much, but in return you get an A1 service(24/7) and i've had 3 outages in 3 years lasting a total of 30 mins."
Brian Jacklin,Peterborough,8/6/09,"I am supposed to get at least 3mbps out of a package supposedly for 8mbps. As I live less than two miles from the relevant exchane (in a straight line the download speed of 0.94 mbps and upload speed of .331mbps are absolutely appalling. I have complained, had the line checked, etc, etc, and all they can tell me is that the speed is unlkely to improve! I cannot get a cable supplier, as the street I live in is paved, not tarmac, and, despite there being a utility strip down the side of the road, the cable companies will not lay it."
C J Castles,North London,8/4/09,BT need to invest to maintain technical quality. I have just switched to Virgin
James Gregory,"Monkton, RAMSGATE< Kent.",8/3/09,When I chose BT I was told that I would get up to 8Mbs download speeds. When I run your speed test the reported speed of my line is recorded as being able to support 3.42 Mbs but the actual achieved speeds are reported as between 38 and 64 per cent less than I should be achieving.
linda miar,easington colliery,8/2/09,"internet keeps going off when or just after I download films.. was pretty good until it went off on thursday 30 july . I called bt , was on phone for 3 hours on thursday. 4 hours on friday. 3 hours on saturday, 1 hour sun morning. and I just tested my download speed which was 5.09"
Keith Wilson,Weston super Mare,8/2/09,I have been with BT 18 Mths now and their service has been terrible. My broadband conection is so slow its only just above dial up speeds. ie not in Mb but messured in Ks and not even many of them . All i can say is the connection is stable but at this speed its sometimes quicker to post a letter. In the 18 mths my service has gone down 3 times each time taking days to get put right
Chris Myatt,"Staffordshire, UK",8/2/09,Broadband connection speed varies from 3000kbps down to 250 kbps depending on time of day. It is usually slow. Lines have been tested by engineer during visit to location and are OK. Modem router has been changed but results are the same on 2 independent computers.
Raymond Thorne,Llanelli,8/2/09,Considering I'm supposed to get around 3.91 and am only getting 2.5max on a good day.The sooner BT puts down cable then maybe the speed would be somewhat faster
Bryan Gray,Ossett,8/2/09,Speed varies by 100% and is low in the late evenings i.e. midnight. The service is expensive and does not offer any significant advantage. Reporting faults can be a long drawn out process often with language difficulties. Especially annoying if you report the same fault several times and know the solution i.e. a reset of the board in the exchange which appears to have a software fault on it causing a lockup. If you want to stay with them and reduce your costs ask for a MAC code. When I did they discounted by 60% provided I signed up for 12 months. I still went ahead and signed up with Sky. Lets see how that goes!!
richard smith,west sussex,8/1/09,For some time now have had consistently slow broadband speed well below that advertised and paid for. I shall be chnaging supplier very soon.
tammie wooldrige,leominster,7/31/09,as usual with BT you give up complaining.would not advise anyone to go to BT for broadband.unless they like talking to call centres that dont understand you.and know less than you about broadband.you spend hours going through BT help.then get the same from someone in a call centre.half the time not understanding them.cant wait till my contract is up.
LEE THUBRON,DARLINGTON,7/30/09,"absolutly pathetic product and service , always get through to an Indian call centre and the staff don't seem very knowledgeable ... cant wait till contract is up will certainly move supplier"
HDhillon,Slough,7/30/09,better than other supplier that i have at this address at least my broadband works 24/7 rather than not working for week in 3 mounths & the supplier taking a week or longer to get me up & running again yes my speed is not fast but that is due to the distance of my house to the exchange so it does not matter who my supplier is my speed will not change & with some suppliers it was actualy less (not sure how that happens) but at least with BT it has been reliable.
M Lynch,Huddersfield,7/30/09,"Call Centres in India, operators have no understanding and are reading from a list of questions."
Steve Glyn,Luddendenfoot,7/30/09,Problems with BTMAIL requiring I reset my router (2-3 times a month). Best speed ever 2.8m & worst 1m.
Bentley,Dorset,7/29/09,"My speed is much lower than promised. 4 was the promise 2.8 the actual, sometimes lower."
David Foster,Bradford,7/29/09,Poor when you have a problem. Difficult to contact VERY.
barry hayman,fakenham norfolk,7/29/09,total scam for top money. pidgeon would be better
Jack Bagley,Yeovil,7/29/09,"It would seem that BT have mis-sold me their deal. I have Total broadband 2 package that should include the phone deals etc, but I find myself at odds with them on every bill date. The line rental bit is always misleading and way over priced. I asked for co-ordinated monthly billing, as BT were still charging me two lots of line rental. I still don't get monthly billing, every time I query this their replies are off hand and arrogant, and nothing has been resolved! I am seriously"
Peter Francis Phillips,Bridgend Mid Glamorgan Wales UK,7/29/09,Not good service...Call centre in India some where..They said it would be 10 years or more until I can expect a better speed I'm getting 1.3 Mbs and paying for 8 Mbs. I live 1.7Kilometers from the exchange...Not good
David Thomson,"Lynemouth, Northumberland",7/29/09,"Having conducted your B/Band speed test i am taken aback by the 193% slower than available to me. I realise that there are quite a few factors to be taken into account and that the advertised download speed is not to be taken at face value however, 193% is, in any subscribers view, unacceptable. What i would like to know is, which ISP controls my local exchange (Lynemouth, Northumberland) as i have tried comparisons, ie; Orange, Talk Talk etc. and find that i can not get their package as advertised because they have to use someone elses system and pass the extra cost on, in order to provide me with B/Band, i suspect BT. To me, this is an anomally as everyone, no matter where they live should be able to get any package that is ADVERTISED. As far as connection is concerned, BT ADVERTISE that they have the best in the land, i say no. The times i have lost my connection is unbelievable compared to when i was with ORANGE aka WANADOO. Help???"
R A Cleverley,Tonyrefail,7/29/09,Speed at best under 4mbps as opposed to the contract of 8mbps. Intermittant performance and various drop outs o occaisions.System needs to be greatly improved before I sign up again.
Andrew Smith,Leek,7/29/09,Almost impossible to contact BT when problems occur. Difficult to understand Indian call centre staff.
John Starbuck,"Egremont, Cumbria",7/28/09,"Nothing but trouble - needed new land line installing, needed customer services to get modem working and to get wireless connectivity working (got no benefit from the ""n standard speed"" hub because had to downrate to 11 mbps at ""g"" to get wireless to work at all) and I only receive 0.9 mbps versus 6.5 mb promised."
Anonymous,Barnstaple Devon,7/28/09,"I use to get Just over 6 at a previous address, this one seems very poor in comparison."
David Jones,Rosyth,7/28/09,Shocked and disappointed by the results of the speed test
Anonymous,London,7/28/09,I really though I had bought a fast service but I tested it today after reading the reports in the press and instead of 8MB i had 0.8MB. Not good enough I will change supplier (currently BT)
